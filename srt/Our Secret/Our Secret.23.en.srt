Our Secret
EP23

2
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,630
This is

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,130
confidential. You shouldn't read it.

4
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,550
So,

5
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,110
because of my royalties of half a million yuan,

6
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,440
you signed this indenture.

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,479
No way.

8
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,950
You don't owe me.

9
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,430
Why did I do it because of you?

10
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,550
Why are you still lying to me?

11
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,440
You don't tell me anything.

12
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not lying.

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,820
I decided to join in Hongguang

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,190
because it

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,030
has a promising future.

16
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,829
You've been so busy lately

17
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,880
for this project?

18
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm sorry to

19
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,800
complain to you so much.

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,250
What are you talking about?

21
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,440
You're my girlfriend.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,270
It's my duty

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
to protect you.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,390
Don't always say sorry to me.

25
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,880
Get it?

26
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,670
Silly girl.

27
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Well, I'm gonna pack up my stuff.

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't overthink.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,050
I'll sleep on the couch.

30
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,470
Zhou Siyue.

31
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,960
I can't sleep.

32
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,079
Do you want to come and sleep over here?

33
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,190
Don't overthink.

34
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,640
We'll take different sides.

35
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,830
Hey,

36
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,320
why is your heart beating so fast?

37
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,720
Sleep tight.

38
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,390
Tell me.

39
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,230
Where have you been last night?

40
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,350
Tell me the truth!

41
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,640
We'll be lenient if you confess,

42
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,230
but if you refuse to, you'll find out what we get.

43
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,159
Why was your cell phone turned off?

44
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,270
Did you guys have...?

45
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,000
No.

46
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,790
No problem!

47
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,390
Tell us!

48
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,110
I went out to dinner with Zhou Siyue yesterday.

49
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,790
It's too late and the dorm was closed.

50
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,880
So,

51
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,820
where did you stay overnight?

52
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,320
In his basement.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Basement.

54
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,270
Did you two do that?

55
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,920
I thought you

56
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,930
were worried about my safety.

57
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
I didn't expect you to be so nosy.

58
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,090
Tell us, please.

59
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,550
So, we can know

60
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,970
if we succeed in transforming you.

61
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
No.

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
We didn't do anything.

63
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Why are you so disappointed?

64
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,159
I think we're doing well.

65
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,720
And,

66
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,950
for some things,

67
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,200
I should take my time and slow down.

68
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,950
Take your time?

69
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,830
Slow down?

70
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,200
Is it Zhou Siyue?

71
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,950
Now you're in a hurry, right?

72
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,640
Hello.

73
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,920
Hi.

74
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Do you know Zhou Siyue?

75
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,290
What's the matter?

76
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,390
This is Jiangling Public Security Bureau.

77
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,390
Zhou Siyue is suspected of revealing company secrets,

78
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,450
and he is summoned.

79
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
Hongguang Technology thinks that

80
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,000
there may be insiders

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,590
giving out company secrets.

82
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,470
It is reported that Hongguang Technology

83
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,280
invested and participated in many experimental projects.

84
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
Hongguang Technology said

85
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
they will not tolerate competitors

86
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,250
viciously disturbing the market,

87
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,080
and will cooperate with the police investigation.

88
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,030
Suspect Zhou

89
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,000
is suspected of revealing company secrets,

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,640
and has been taken into police custody. He will be sued.

91
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Dear, are you okay?

92
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,200
Nurse!

93
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,790
Nurse, come and check him!

94
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,200
Hello, mom.

95
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Xianxian.

96
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,710
How are you doing?

97
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,670
I just helped him ask for leave from school today.

98
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
Other things

99
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,080
are all under progress.

100
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
I was asking

101
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,670
how you are doing.

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,030
Me?

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,790
I'm doing fine.

104
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,400
Don't worry.

105
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,440
Xianxian.

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
Take care of yourself.

107
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't wear yourself out.

108
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,670
If you do, Mom, Dad and he

109
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,940
will be so worried.

110
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,110
Don't worry.

111
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,910
If that's all, I have to go.

112
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,760
Red Horse wanted me to infiltrate Hongguang,

113
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,550
and steal information

114
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,340
about Hongguang for them.

115
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,200
But, I've already

116
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,320
rejected their proposal clearly.

117
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,350
Then why does

118
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,110
Red Horse's source code of the new project

119
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,710
highly resemble

120
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,890
the source code of the project you did for Hongguang?

121
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,300
I told him thousands of times that

122
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,730
it should be done without any traces.

123
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,280
Why did he still get caught?

124
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,230
When you intended to use Hongguang's information

125
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,670
to release your product,

126
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,350
you should have expected this.

127
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,520
You're here to lecture me?

128
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,110
He knows too much.

129
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,080
Get him a lawyer right now,

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,410
and get him out of there.

131
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,150
He mustn't breathe a word.

132
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Mr. Su, someone wants to see you.

133
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,350
Go do your job.

134
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,080
Okay.

135
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,320
Xianxian.

136
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm here for Zhou Siyue.

137
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,240
Have a seat, please.

138
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,430
I'm sorry, Xianxian.

139
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
This is the only thing

140
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,640
that I can't help you.

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,150
I understand.

142
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,520
After all, it's your company.

143
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,040
Xianxian, that's not what I meant.

144
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Except for this,

145
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,090
I can help you with anything else.

146
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,030
You and students of Huaqing University

147
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,030
have so many cooperative projects?

148
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,640
I have to go.

149
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,030
Xianxian.

150
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,840
Zhang.

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Hand that folder over to me, please.

152
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,760
Professor Ye.

153
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,230
Hi, Professor Ye.

154
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,350
Auntie.

155
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,080
Xianxian.

156
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,880
Why are you here?

157
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,930
I've been so busy recently that

158
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,260
I didn't get any chance to see you.

159
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,470
I was inconsiderate.

160
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,030
I should have come and visited you.

161
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,110
Don't say that.

162
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,470
I'm so happy you came here.

163
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,670
Have a seat.

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,400
Time flies.

165
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,840
You kids have all grown up.

166
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,280
Actually, we as parents

167
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,470
don't want you to push yourselves so hard.

168
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,790
Take some time

169
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,200
to sit and chat with us like this.

170
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,320
Because, we are growing old, too.

171
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,510
We're always worried that maybe

172
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,520
sometime in the future,

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,350
we won't have any chance to talk.

174
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,790
No, it can't be.

175
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,030
Hey.

176
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,470
I'm always so sentimental.

177
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,640
If they two saw it,

178
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,470
they would laugh at me.

179
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,200
You have to keep it a secret for me.

180
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,520
Auntie,

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,280
uncle will be fine.

182
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,230
Thank you, Xianxian.

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Ding Xian.

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,670
I just got off the phone with the lawyer.

185
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,270
I have something to tell you.

186
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,710
Go ahead.

187
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,620
Auntie, I'll have a talk with him.

188
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,110
Siyue is now

189
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,770
considered as the prime suspect.

190
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,400
Because, in the entire project team,

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,060
he's the only one that had contacted with Red Horse Tech's people.

192
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,520
He did that because of me.

193
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,990
Don't think too much.

194
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,790
Cooperating with Hongguang

195
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,640
was a good opportunity for him.

196
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,430
There's one more thing I forgot to tell you.

197
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,520
Before Siyue was taken away,

198
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,770
he asked me to give this to you.

199
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,670
Where's Zhou Zongtang's relative?

200
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm here.

201
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,320
The operation was a success. Don't worry.

202
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,960
Thank you.

203
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,400
Thank you, nurse.

204
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,330
You're welcome.

205
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,640
What a relief.

206
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,290
That's great, auntie.

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,840
Don't worry about it.

208
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,670
That's great.

209
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,670
Don't worry.

210
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,030
This lawyer Pan

211
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,880
argued with me all the time when we were at school.

212
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,610
Our friendship had been deeper as we argued more.

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,960
Now he is a first-class lawyer in China.

214
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,230
Ye.

215
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,080
Pan.

216
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,670
Long time no see!

217
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,200
Let me introduce him to you.

218
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
This is lawyer Pan.

219
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,150
This is my student Ding Xian.

220
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Hi, Lawyer Pan.

221
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,080
Hi.

222
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,210
Take a seat, please.

223
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,080
How is it?

224
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,470
This isn't much of an office.

225
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't feel any humanistic and artistic spirit at all.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,930
Hey, stop there.

227
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,320
You have enough time to criticize me later on,

228
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,960
but I ask you here today to talk about proper business.

229
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,150
How's my student?

230
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,110
I have learned about his situation.

231
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,880
After you told me what's going on,

232
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
I also did some research.

233
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,670
Right now,

234
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,200
just a few photos and phone records

235
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,080
can't be taken as evidence.

236
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,640
You can rest assured.

237
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,320
He'll be released on bail pending trial.

238
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,850
We'll get to the rest of it when he is released.

239
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,610
You stayed up all night to do your homework again?

240
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,230
Did you finish it?

241
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Not yet.

242
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,480
In the past two days,

243
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,470
you've been running around hospital and school.

244
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,190
I can't bear to see you getting bigger dark circles.

245
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,050
How about this?

246
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,480
I'll ask our teacher

247
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,569
to let you hand in your paper later.

248
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm okay.

249
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,390
Don't worry about me.

250
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,349
Stop smiling like that.

251
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
It's hurting me.

252
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,920
Let's go.

253
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,110
Thank you.

254
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,190
She's sick.

255
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,070
That's gross.

256
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,040
Do you know that

257
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
Zhou Siyue

258
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,710
has been bailed?

259
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,310
Zhou Siyue is really something.

260
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,470
He knew that

261
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,040
we sent the lawyer there.

262
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,350
Boss Ma,

263
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,550
you made a wrong bet from the beginning.

264
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,220
We shouldn't choose Hongguang Technology,

265
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,310
but Zhou Siyue.

266
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,350
Su,

267
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,190
do you have any idea?

268
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,760
Get a good lawyer,

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
and be ready for the lawsuit.

270
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,400
Boss Ma.

271
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,710
We've already lost.

272
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,160
Ding Xian.

273
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,950
Pan was very efficient.

274
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,080
I have picked up him.

275
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,470
Where are you now? I'll meet you.

276
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,950
Go back to classes now.

277
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,190
Enjoy your class. I'll see you soon.

278
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,520
Okay.

279
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,760
You're home.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,930
What happened? You hit somewhere?

281
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,560
I was just about to get you a blanket,

282
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,170
but, you were asleep and I didn't want to wake you up.

283
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,470
Silly girl.

284
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,990
How is everything going?

285
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,820
We haven't met each other for so long.

286
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,310
Did you miss me?

287
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,880
Yeah.

288
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,430
Zhou Siyue.

289
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,680
Come here.

290
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,640
Let me hug you.

291
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,950
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,310
I thought I was strong.

293
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,760
This year,

294
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,210
I have been striving to

295
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,230
protect you.

296
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,590
But, I didn't expect

297
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,040
I was the one who concerned you in the end.

298
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

299
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,560
I let you down.

300
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,710
How could you let me down?

301
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,350
You gotta trust me,

302
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
Zhou Siyue.

303
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
I love you so much.

304
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,350
I'll always be with you,

305
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,520
no matter what happens.

306
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,040
Thank you.

307
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,890
What you just said means

308
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Red Horse wanted to get you out, too?

309
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,680
Red Horse wanted to

310
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,760
solve this matter in a low profile.

311
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,130
Because I know too much,

312
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,430
if I'm under arrest,

313
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,310
it won't do them any good.

314
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,800
So, I think

315
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,520
the first one who tried to get me out

316
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,350
must be from Red Horse.

317
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,830
But, the priority now

318
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,950
is to find out the real culprit,

319
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,230
so we can prove your innocence.

320
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,560
When you go back, think carefully

321
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,220
if there is anyone close to you

322
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,280
but holds grudges against you.

323
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,400
What's wrong?

324
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,770
You look so serious.

325
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,470
Did you go to Su Bocong again?

326
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,160
It's all for you.

327
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,190
Why are you still acting like a child?

328
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,440
I don't want you see him anymore.

329
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,680
I know what he's thinking.

330
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,680
I won't see him anymore.

331
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
What's wrong?

332
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,230
Did he do anything to you?

333
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,520
No,

334
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,710
it's just,

335
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,350
looking back, I feel everyone has changed.

336
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,110
We were so close, but,

337
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,680
now we've got nothing to say.

338
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,160
If so, don't talk to him then.

339
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,110
I won't change anyway.

340
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,950
I know.

341
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,130
I've got something to show you.

342
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Wait a moment. I have something to tell you.

343
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
Do you remember that I told you

344
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,350
I saw Dong Zhengfei's name in Red Horse?

345
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,350
After that, I went back to school.

346
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,800
One day, I saw him together with Hongguang's people.

347
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,350
I didn't know until I asked others.

348
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,430
The moment you got arrested,

349
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,560
he signed a contract with Hongguang to replace you.

350
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,020
It doesn't make any sense.

351
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,680
What are you doing?

352
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,810
We were thinking about the same thing.

353
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,400
Look.

354
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,070
I compared

355
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,800
the code I wrote

356
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,280
and the code of Red Horse's new products.

357
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,010
Do they look exactly the same at the first glance?

358
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
But, look here.

359
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,430
Outdated code-writing like this

360
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,280
could only be written by one person

361
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,190
that's close to me.

362
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
And when this project was launched,

363
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,860
it's at school.

364
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,710
So,

365
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,680
the person who had the opportunity to learn about this code

366
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
can only be him.

367
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,880
So what are you going to do now?

368
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Wait for him to come to me.

369
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
Here you come.

370
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,650
Come and take a look at it for me.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,730
As for program you designed for the robot before,

372
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,770
I still haven't figured it out.

373
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,920
It's you.

374
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,470
I didn't expect that an email

375
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,640
could get you here.

376
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,160
I didn't expect that such a simple trick

377
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,160
would get me hooked, too.

378
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,640
Maybe it's because

379
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,070
I can't solve

380
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,770
the virus code you sent me.

381
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,550
And that made me irrational.

382
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,090
If I didn't come here today,

383
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,910
would you really hack into my computer?

384
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,310
I don't do anything illegal.

385
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,800
You regret it?

386
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,640
Kind of.

387
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,230
To be honest,

388
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,410
I was worried that you wouldn't show up today.

389
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,830
But, I was also afraid that you do.

390
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,590
At this moment,

391
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,920
stop telling me these fancy words.

392
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,560
At this moment, I don't need to lie to you.

393
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,840
Professor Ye told me before that

394
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,230
he thinks highly of you.

395
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,160
He said you like to chase dead ends,

396
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,760
but

397
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,060
you have solid professional skills.

398
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,190
He also said,

399
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,440
if only we could learn from each other.

400
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,700
But, he has always been favoring you.

401
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,230
If you're talking about the quota for going abroad,

402
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,830
Professor Ye actually applied for two quotas.

403
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,880
So, you and I

404
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,070
are never enemies.

405
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,430
Why didn't you say so earlier?

406
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,190
Everything

407
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,230
is too late.

408
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,680
Okay.

409
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,480
Let me explain to you

410
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,360
the program you mentioned.

411
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Later on,

412
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,870
you may not see me for a long time.

413
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,190
It's now or never.

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,040
I can be your tutor today.

415
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,070
Okay.

416
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,920
Su, I've got something to tell you.

417
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,120
What a coincidence, Boss Ma.

418
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,430
I also want to tell you something.

419
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,280
Alright.

420
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,830
A cup of cold brewed coffee, please.

421
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,280
Okay.

422
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,800
Do you remember when we were kids,

423
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,860
the coffee we drank for the first time

424
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,920
was brought by the uncle next door from downtown.

425
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,160
My dad said it wouldn't be bitter this way.

426
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,770
Is it still bitter?

427
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,000
No,

428
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,760
it's too sweet.

429
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,400
You try it.

430
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,190
You try it.

431
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,350
Thank you.

432
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,230
When you were a kid, you said

433
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,690
you would never drink this damn thing again.

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,350
Yeah, a lot has changed.

435
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,050
No, not really.

436
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,350
Actually,

437
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,950
your outfit is always nice and neat.

438
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,160
Su, why are you going back so soon this time?

439
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,110
I have to hurry back for extra classes during the vacation.

440
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,040
Shen Hai High School has an intensive curriculum.

441
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,170
I may be left behind if I don't try hard.

442
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,520
What is Shen Hai High School like?

443
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
I can't describe it in a few words.

444
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,920
Aren't you going to take the entrance exam soon?

445
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,850
You'll know when you are enrolled.

446
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,880
Don't fail the exam then.

447
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,710
How is that possible?

448
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,070
You could pass the exam. So will I.

449
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,410
Not only will I pass,

450
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,710
I will get higher scores than yours.

451
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,230
Okay.

452
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,640
You love to compare yourself with me since you were a child.

453
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,770
But, you have to work harder to catch up with me this time.

454
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,950
That's

455
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,730
the last time we met in junior high school.

456
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,190
After that...

457
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,470
After that,

458
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,610
we met in Shen Hai High School.

459
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,310
To be honest,

460
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,560
I envy you a lot.

461
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,930
We were both admitted to Shen Hai High School.

462
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,430
I always thought your high school life

463
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,010
would be just like mine.

464
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,320
You would feel isolated,

465
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,950
and lonely.

466
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,470
Adolescence

467
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,950
is turbulent.

468
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,640
But, you always have people around you

469
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,280
willing to reach out to you.

470
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,110
I envy you a lot,

471
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,660
and I feel very happy for you, too.

472
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,070
So, you won't be like me,

473
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,310
becoming a bad guy.

474
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,040
You're not a bad guy, Su.

475
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,040
You are also the one who has been reaching out to me.

476
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
Isn't it?

477
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,230
After that, I've been missing

478
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,590
our secret base.

479
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,640
I always keep

480
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,310
this photo.

481
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Ding Xian.

482
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,800
I hope you can always smile like this.

483
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,469
I will.

484
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,560
You still smile as the same as at that time.

485
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,630
You can do this too, Su.

486
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
You can also go back to the way you used to be.

487
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,230
There's another thing.

488
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,180
Do me a favor. Give this to Zhou Siyue.

489
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,160
This is the information that can help his father.

490
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

491
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,380
I actually knew I stand no chance,

492
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,030
but I still don't want to go to your wedding.

493
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,290
It's fine that you don't come,

494
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,760
but don't forget the cash gift.

495
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,840
Cash gift?

496
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,420
It depends on my mood that day.

497
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,910
Why are you so stingy?

498
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,390
How am I stingy?

499
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,860
Do you remember the review materials from high school?

500
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,730
You've been watching it all this while. Are you done?

501
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,040
You like this photo that much?

502
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,910
Don't you think it's nice?

503
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,800
Among all my photos,

504
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,320
this is the nicest.

505
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,520
You look prettier than the picture.

506
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
It has nothing to do with the person who took the photo.

507
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,840
I think you're right.

508
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,430
Why didn't you tell me?

509
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,870
It's so close.

510
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,670
It's nice.

511
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,320
I'll be the one to take your photos.

512
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,710
It is nice.

513
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,680
Let's take a picture together.

514
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,080
Alright.

515
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
Ready.

516
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,040
One, two.

517
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,950
Look.

518
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,240
You didn't capture that.

519
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
I did.

520
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,670
I exercise every day.

521
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,150
-We can exercise together some other day. -Okay.

522
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,520
-Bye. -Bye.

523
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,490
Let me offer you a hand.

524
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,080
No, it's fine.

525
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,280
You guys can get upstairs now.

526
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll take care of the rest of it.

527
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,520
-Okay, be careful. -Okay.

528
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,890
It's nice to be back, right?

529
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,000
Zhou Siyue.

530
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,360
Siyue! Siyue!

531
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,710
The key.

532
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,150
Don't do that!

533
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,040
Lazy bone!

534
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,080
Ding Xian.

535
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,840
Why are you standing there?

536
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,760
Move your stuff quickly!

537
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Ding Juncong.

538
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,470
Do you need my help?

539
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,840
What? You don't know your own home?

540
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,800
No.

541
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,520
I thought

542
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,950
I wouldn't come back here again.

543
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,430
You thought

544
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,800
you wouldn't talk to me again back then.

545
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,710
Didn't I apologize for it?

546
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,870
How can you forgive me?

547
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,130
Mom and dad are still here.

548
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,320
Zhou.

549
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,040
Zhou.

550
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,250
-Zhou. -Wencheng, here you come!

551
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,120
Wanxian, why didn't you tell us

552
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,280
that you moved back?

553
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,870
I was thinking about cleaning the house first

554
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,080
and inviting you over for dinner.

555
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,360
Right, I didn't want to bother you before.

556
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,520
It's also their summer vacation.

557
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,380
Xianxian and Siyue are both home.

558
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,330
Let's make time and get together.

559
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,120
Right, get together at my house.

560
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,280
-Siyue. -We came to your house

561
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,740
to help you arrange stuff.

562
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,630
Let me help you.

563
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,950
Just leave it there.

564
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,670
Xianxian.

565
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,710
Siyue.

566
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,080
What's wrong with Siyue?

567
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,340
I was moving stuff and sprained my ankle.

568
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,670
Really? Let me check.

569
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,670
-Check him. -No, it's fine.

570
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,230
I'll get you some medicine.

571
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll help you.

572
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,630
Leave it there.

573
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,080
-You can't move it yourself. -Are you okay?

574
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,010
-Are you okay? -I feel much better.

575
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,950
Siyue finally moved back?

576
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,910
Where are his parents?

577
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,400
They went out to play mahjong with my parents.

578
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,950
Shadi.

579
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,390
Look.

580
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,870
When did she post that?

581
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,040
I was wondering why Jiang Chen

582
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,900
insisted on traveling with Keke.

583
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,320
It turned out he had a plan.

584
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,600
That's great.

585
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,280
It's nice.

586
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,360
It must look very good on my hands.

587
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,430
If you like it so much,

588
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,390
ask Song Ziqi to buy you one.

589
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,950
Stop talking about me.

590
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,710
How long are you going to hide it

591
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,230
from his parents?

592
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,960
What are you worried about?

593
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,320
His parents like you.

594
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,670
Yeah,

595
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,910
but we need a right timing.

596
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,600
Their family has finally

597
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,190
settled down.

598
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,060
We'll talk about it later.

599
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,560
Don't worry about me.

600
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,000
Worry about yourself.

601
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,870
Song Ziqi, check your phone.

602
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,520
Hold on. I'll defeat you in next round.

603
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,040
You said it in last round.

604
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,900
Jiang Chen really got something.

605
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,540
They're getting married.

606
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,870
I told him it would be successful.

607
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,000
He was so nervous.

608
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,560
You knew it?

609
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,390
Then why didn't he tell me?

610
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,230
He told me you had a big mouth.

611
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,760
If he told you, the whole world would know it.

612
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,020
I have to research how much he spent on it.

613
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,970
What's going on?

614
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,540
You are in a hurry, too?

615
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,470
Hey, do you know why that little madam

616
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,040
asked me to see this?

617
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
That is a hint.

618
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,430
So expensive.

619
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,040
I have to save money from now on.

620
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,430
You're thinking quite much.

621
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,470
I call it taking precautions.

622
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,840
Maybe I'll get it done faster than you.

623
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,560
Why so?

624
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,470
Look. Isn't your father just recovered?

625
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,950
You have to wait

626
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,150
for the right timing.

627
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,840
Why should I wait?

628
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,430
I was too busy before.

629
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,890
So, I didn't tell them.

630
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,120
I plan

631
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
to tell them directly this time.

632
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,580
I'll get it done quicker than you anyway.

633
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,710
Impossible.

634
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,390
Impossible?

635
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,120
Go, go, go.

636
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,300
It's full of memories.

637
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,670
Come here.

638
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,870
Hey,

639
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,710
you're from Shen Hai High School?

640
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,520
Right.

641
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,320
Me, too.

642
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,430
Hi, senior.

643
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,910
This is my deskmate.

644
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,320
Hi, senior.

645
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,360
Seniors, we have to go.

646
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,080
Goodbye.

647
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,430
It's so childish.

648
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,230
What's wrong?

649
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,630
Let them envy us.

650
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,710
When you grow up, you can just show it.

651
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,520
I'll take you to visit my parents later.

652
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,910
All of a sudden?

653
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,360
All of a sudden?

654
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,950
I didn't plan to hide it.

655
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
No.

656
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,390
Your dad just got recovered.

657
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,080
What if

658
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,430
your mom and dad don't like me?

659
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,730
Are you still worried about this?

660
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,740
Don't they treat you well?

661
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,710
They do,

662
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,630
but that's different.

663
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,150
Before,

664
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,800
we were friends.

665
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,760
Now, I'm your girlfriend.

666
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,710
What if they think I'm not good enough for you?

667
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,920
What are you talking about?

668
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,520
Ding Xian.

669
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,190
Being with you is my greatest blessing.

670
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,670
It's me who is not good enough for you.

671
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,280
Also,

672
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,730
my mom liked you so much back then.

673
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,850
When I saw that, I was jealous.

674
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,340
You think too much.

675
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,360
I didn't expect you, Zhou Siyue,

676
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,840
to say something like that.

677
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,670
You're right.

678
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,520
I'm so cute.

679
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,800
Auntie must like me.

680
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,910
Your mindset changed so quickly.

681
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,560
Don't be so proud.

682
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,000
Didn't you say that

683
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,710
being with me is the greatest blessing?

684
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,440
Around this time before,

685
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,910
kids would all be home from school.

686
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,600
It feels like it was yesterday.

687
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,840
They all grew up in an instant.

688
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,630
Yeah.

689
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,910
You can chill now.

690
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,140
I still have to look after the kid.

691
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,220
When Xianxian gets married and gives birth,

692
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,230
as a grandmother,

693
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,150
I have to look after my grandchild.

694
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,560
It's endless.

695
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,040
Married?

696
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,040
Xianxian has a boyfriend?

697
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,230
Siyue didn't tell you?

698
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,710
No.

699
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,230
You know Siyue.

700
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,860
He likes to hide everything in his heart.

701
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,600
Do you remember that

702
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,630
when they were young, we arranged their marriage.

703
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,390
Yeah, that was when they were kids.

704
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,520
It's years ago.

705
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,280
The old people at that time

706
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,230
liked to arrange marriages.

707
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,560
It doesn't count now.

708
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,710
Besides,

709
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,050
you know our family's situation.

710
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,630
We can't be your burden.

711
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,360
Yeah, it's arranged when they were kids.

712
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,670
It doesn't count.

713
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,320
Right?

714
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,430
Right.

715
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,190
They really broke off the engagement?

716
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,080
It's not really so.

717
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,910
My mom was saying that

718
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,250
what they said before doesn't count.

719
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,390
I was wondering why my mom came home

720
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,840
with a worried face.

721
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,210
It turned out that it was because of this.

722
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,040
So what now?

723
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,800
I don't know why my mom

724
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,400
was like that all of a sudden.

725
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,080
We can only

726
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,560
take one step at a time.

727
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,040
I knew it wouldn't go smoothly.

728
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,870
Since she wanted to break off the child engagement,

729
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,630
it means she disagrees with us being together.

730
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,280
Hey, don't overthink.

731
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,870
Aren't you sleepy? Go to bed first.

732
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,280
How can I still fall asleep?

733
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,800
How about going to bed now

734
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,360
and I'll take you somewhere when you wake up tomorrow?

735
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,670
Good night then.

736
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,840
Good night.
