Our Secret
EP24

2
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,360
Come here.

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,120
Isn't this the planetarium you took me to

4
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,800
on my birthday?

5
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,680
Why are we here?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,190
To cheer you up.

7
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,310
Can we solve the problem by cheering me up?

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,760
I've decided that no matter what happens,

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
I'll be with you,

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,440
but I'm still feeling bad.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,750
Come here. Take a seat.

12
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,910
Why aren't you anxious at all?

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,320
It's no big deal to have our betrothal cancelled.

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
We can get engaged again.

15
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,720
This isn't that simple.

16
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,670
What if your mom still opposes.

17
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,070
Your shoe lace is untied.

18
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,030
I'll tie...

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,750
Let me.

20
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,829
How can I bother you with this?

21
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,240
Be engaged again.

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,670
Will you?

23
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I know this ring looks a bit crude,

24
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,670
but one day I will definitely,

25
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,270
give you a real one.

26
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,800
If you have to blame,

27
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,370
blame me for my eagerness.

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,440
I can't wait any longer.

29
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,830
Ding Xian,

30
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,390
If in this world,

31
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,720
there is one reason that we can't be together,

32
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,820
then I'll find a thousand,

33
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,790
ten thousand

34
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
reasons why we can.

35
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,040
For every minute of the rest of my life,

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,760
I want you to be part of it.

37
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,200
Will you say yes?

38
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,420
I'll help you put it on.

39
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,110
Why bother?

40
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,440
Indeed.

41
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,950
I thought you were testing me.

42
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,370
How could you not tell me directly?

43
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,370
I didn't know

44
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,520
that those two were together already.

45
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,670
I've been worried about our situation

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,550
would bother you.

47
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,550
Am I that snobbish to you?

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,070
As long as they are happy, as a parent,

49
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,780
I'd only be happy for them.

50
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,670
I thought you didn't like our Xianxian,

51
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,200
and were looking for someone better.

52
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Are you serious?

53
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,790
For all these years, the way I treat Xianxian,

54
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,760
didn't you know?

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,110
- Okay. - I care about her almost more than you do, her own mother.

56
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,230
Fine, It's just a misunderstanding.

57
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,480
So it seems that, from now on,

58
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,320
we'd be in-laws.

59
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,650
Hurry up and packed up.

60
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,320
We'd go to school later.

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,880
Give me another minute. We still have time.

62
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,320
Come here.

63
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,440
Did you have the feeling that,

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,900
ever since I started using your place as an occasional studio,

65
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,440
the whole place started to look different?

66
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,230
Look at these paintings on the wall.

67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Don't you think,

68
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,270
that your home get much warmer?

69
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
What do you mean, my home?

70
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,830
This is our home.

71
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,390
Cut it off.

72
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,400
Didn't you say that we still have time?

73
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
So how about we don't go to school today?

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Boss, busy?

75
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,360
Is the orange sweet?

76
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Let me have a bite.

77
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,350
No.

78
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,230
So it's from my sister-in-law then?

79
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,510
It seems, now that you're in love,

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
you've become...

81
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,510
tenderer,

82
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
and more focused.

83
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,440
The power of love.

84
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Cut the crap.

85
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh right,

86
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,390
Professor Ye wants you to go for him.

87
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,480
I think it's probably still the thing last time.

88
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,940
Have you made up your mind?

89
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,510
Okay.

90
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,789
Young lady,

91
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,909
may I have the honor to have you come to dinner with me?

92
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,590
Dinner?

93
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,760
This lady seems to be in a bad mood.

94
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,760
Nothing can't be solved

95
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,400
by a nice dinner.

96
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
What's wrong?

97
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,230
All right, let's go have dinner, okay?

98
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm so hungry.

99
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,710
What is it?

100
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,350
Enough with that joking face.

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,210
Professor Ye already told me everything.

102
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,470
Tell me,

103
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,700
why did you reject the opportunity to study abroad?

104
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,340
So that's what's been bothering you?

105
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,380
Are you still worried about that long-distance relationship thing?

106
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,400
I just want to,

107
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,130
spend more time with you, what's wrong with that?

108
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,080
If I were that far away,

109
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,200
I'd be really worried about you here.

110
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,280
Zhou Siyue,

111
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm not a three-year-old.

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,730
You're just pissing me off.

113
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,910
Do not make me your excuse to stop going forward.

114
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,710
I...

115
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,840
You shut up.

116
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,480
Let me talk this time.

117
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,200
All the efforts you made,

118
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,960
weren't they all for this?

119
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,880
What if after ten years, twenty years,

120
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,230
we broke up,

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,330
and you thought of this,

122
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,080
wouldn't you hate me for that?

123
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,030
Nonsense!

124
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,590
How could we,

125
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,790
break up?

126
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,590
I said what if.

127
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,790
There is no "what if".

128
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,000
Zhou Siyue,

129
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,370
I just want you all the good.

130
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,610
You talking like this,

131
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,080
just makes me even harder to leave.

132
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,350
Don't worry about me.

133
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll take care of myself.

134
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,360
I'm not going anywhere.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,010
And you are not going anywhere either.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,910
Okay.

137
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,960
I promise you.

138
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,520
Promise?

139
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Fingers.

140
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,790
Stop it.

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,590
This is for you.

142
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,930
Where did you get this?

143
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,550
I saw it when shopping in the mall.

144
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,810
And I bought it for you.

145
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,710
Wait.

146
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,880
Guess again.

147
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
Is this a dinosaur or a crocodile?

148
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,590
Crocodile.

149
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,960
Fine, I was wrong again.

150
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,150
It's okay.

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,030
This time, it is whatever you say it is.

152
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,470
You take this.

153
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,320
Why?

154
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Stand over there.

155
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,000
Why?

156
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,590
Come on! Stand over there.

157
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,640
Just do it.

158
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,910
Come on!

159
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,440
For what?

160
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,770
Over there, over there.

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,710
Stand still, right, over there.

162
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,050
I'll draw a father-and-son portrait for you two.

163
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Hold it tighter.

164
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,400
Is this fine?

165
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,390
Fine. You two look really alike.

166
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,110
My dear big brother,

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
My dear little brother,

168
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,590
we finally meet!

169
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,480
Are you two having an online love affair turning offline?

170
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,110
What are you talking about?

171
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,320
This is online friends meeting each other.

172
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,470
What do you mean love affair?

173
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,280
When did you guys become,

174
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,150
so intimate?

175
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,080
Just now.

176
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,790
Jokes aside,

177
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,230
without us,

178
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,910
you think you could get Xianxian this fast?

179
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,710
Exactly!

180
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,640
Indeed, today I'd like to thank you both.

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,110
Come on,

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,030
-Cheers. -Cheers.

183
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,110
Cheers.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,710
Xianxian,

185
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,790
You're home.

186
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,430
Or should I call you sister-in-law now?

187
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,520
Sister-in-law?

188
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Here,

189
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,010
I'm telling you,

190
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,230
you have no idea how many ideas the two of us

191
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,160
gave the boss when he was after you.

192
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,880
Is that so?

193
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,760
What ideas were those?

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,930
Not telling you.

195
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,710
It's my home court today, let's drink.

196
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,000
Fine, drink up.

197
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,640
Hey sis, why don't you come join us?

198
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,030
I'll cut you some fruit.

199
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
Good wife.

200
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,030
Here, to sister-in-law.

201
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,280
-Come on, cheers. -Cheers!

202
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,400
My head hurts.

203
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,690
You shouldn't drink that much.

204
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,550
You...don't touch me!

205
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,550
Don't touch me!

206
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,110
Zhou Siyue,

207
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,440
once you're abroad,

208
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,420
remember to send me a message.

209
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,110
I know you too well.

210
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,760
You keep everything inside.

211
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,760
You won't tell me anything.

212
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,010
You... you don't understand!

213
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,840
Do you know how long I've been with him?

214
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,520
Do you know what we've been through

215
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,670
in high school?

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,640
Do you know how much he's taken on for me?

217
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,790
Do you know?

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
You... you don't!

219
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,200
You don't know.

220
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,550
Okay, okay.

221
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,610
Let's go. Let's go.

222
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,790
Take care of him.

223
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,000
I...

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,400
don't care what other people say about you.

225
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,400
You will definitely become,

226
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,200
the Zhou Siyue you want to be.

227
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,110
Take care.

228
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I don't want to go.

229
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,230
That's not right.

230
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,520
Come on, you've promised.

231
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,710
Then let me hold you a little longer.

232
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Tomorrow, I won't be able to.

233
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,680
You know,

234
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
when I was young,

235
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,070
my mom and dad rarely saw each other.

236
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,900
Whenever they did, they'd fight.

237
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,520
So, I thought they didn't love each other.

238
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,470
Later,

239
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,520
I found out that,

240
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,560
it's not that they didn't love each other,

241
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,680
but they love each other deep enough to trust each other,

242
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,300
that's why they could hold on for so long.

243
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,640
So can we.

244
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,120
You have to wait for me to come back.

245
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,950
I will.

246
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,070
Okay. Promise.

247
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,590
You saw him off?

248
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,060
The plane's taken off.

249
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,560
Come on! The long-distance relationship is officially on!

250
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,230
It's a long and winding road ahead.

251
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,590
Wait for me to accompany you in a few days.

252
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh no, it's too hot.

253
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,190
Then why are you still leaning on me?

254
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,090
I'll turn on the air...

255
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,850
Save some electricity.

256
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,190
Our electricity bill has already exceeded our budget.

257
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,120
Your temperature is lower. I just want to lean on you.

258
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,590
Fine, go ahead.

259
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,800
It's too hot.

260
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,070
I hate summers.

261
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,800
My baby is definitely not gonna be born in summer.

262
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,130
That's quite a long vision you have there.

263
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm just saying.

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
I didn't say I was gonna have a baby with you.

265
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
Then who are you having with?

266
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,190
I'm not saying that I'm having a baby.

267
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,830
I'm just saying if I have one.

268
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,800
But seriously,

269
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,830
if you had to pick a season,

270
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,710
which one would you pick?

271
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,760
Spring.

272
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,040
I like spring too.

273
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,310
You said that the reason you like spring

274
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,680
is that spring is like me.

275
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,070
I've only started to like spring

276
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,160
after I met you.

277
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
Because

278
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,230
April has the best scenery, doesn't it?

279
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,280
You are the April of this world,

280
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,110
and you are Zhou Siyue of mine.

281
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,800
Happy birthday.

282
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,470
Am I the first one,

283
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,070
to blow the candles with you?

284
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,070
Childish.

285
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,280
What did you wish for?

286
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,230
To see you sooner.

287
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,160
You'll see me soon.

288
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,850
Hang on a little longer.

289
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
What's wrong?

290
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,280
Hasn't he answered you yet?

291
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,350
I don't know what he's been up to.

292
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,950
Next,

293
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,950
let's welcome the Outstanding Student Representative

294
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,160
Ding Xian,

295
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,470
an undergraduate from Class 2 of the Computer Science Department

296
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,400
enrolled in 2013

297
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,560
to give us a speech.

298
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,490
Hold it for me. I'll go up to the stage.

299
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,640
Hello everyone, I'm Ding Xian.

300
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,680
It's an honor to be here with you,

301
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,810
and share the excitement and honor I'm having right now.

302
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,310
Four years ago,

303
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,190
full of dreams and hope, I walked

304
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,070
into the beautiful schoolyard of Hua Qing University.

305
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,470
During the four years, we've had laughter,

306
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
tears,

307
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,230
we've also got confused.

308
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,920
Everyone and everything we encountered here,

309
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,800
will come together in bits and pieces

310
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,590
to form

311
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,480
our best memories of youth.

312
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,280
Happy Graduation.

313
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,110
We've graduated!

314
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,830
We've graduated!

315
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,520
We've graduated!

316
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,470
Happy graduation!

317
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
What are you filming?

318
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,790
Lou Feng, what are you doing?

319
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,800
Stop it.

320
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,760
Well, stop it.

321
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,830
Let me. Let me do it.

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,930
Give me a chance.

323
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,160
Come on, stand there and let me take a picture.

324
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,000
Camera on us.

325
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,430
The lighting's not good here. Let's go over there.

326
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,630
Lighting's not good?

327
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,280
It's backlighting this way. How about now?

328
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,110
Now it's fine. Now it's fine.

329
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,950
Your hair, the hair, give it a fling.

330
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,550
Right, it's good, it's good.

331
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,710
What do you want to say at the final moment of graduation?

332
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,680
Me! I want to get a boyfriend.

333
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,260
I wanna try all the best food in the world.

334
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,540
Forget about the food!

335
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,340
Happy graduation!

336
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Why did you come back early?

337
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,440
I'll skip your romance.

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,920
Didn't you make the wish?

339
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,040
Of course I have to come back early.

340
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,400
You're back without a gift.

341
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,950
I did bring one.

342
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,350
Where?

343
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,400
What are you filming?

344
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,110
Did you get me in the film?

345
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm filming now.

346
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,280
How's my hair?

347
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,710
It's fine.

348
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,370
What are you doing?

349
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830
Embarrassing!

350
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,760
Cheesy!

351
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Stop it!

352
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,310
No, we won't!

353
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Stop filming.

354
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,280
Rock scissor paper.

355
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,810
That doesn't count. One more time!

356
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,590
Rock scissor paper.

357
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,110
One last time!

358
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,590
Last time.

359
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,620
Whoever loses will do the dishes.

360
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,160
Rock scissor paper.

361
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,800
You want me to do the dishes the first day I moved in?

362
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,610
Then you have another choice.

363
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,280
You could help me find my passport.

364
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,520
Fine, little lord Zhou.

365
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,720
I must send it to my mom tomorrow.

366
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,340
On the cabinet over there.

367
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,070
This one?

368
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,040
You're still keeping these?

369
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
There's a box.

370
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,430
Open it.

371
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,110
Ding Xian,

372
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,950
if I hadn't had you,

373
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,110
in my life,

374
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,800
I wouldn't be the person I am now.

375
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,070
You know, back in high school,

376
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,670
when I first laid eyes on you,

377
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,310
I was thinking,

378
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,160
how can there be

379
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,040
such a stubborn girl in this world?

380
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,720
One who doesn't like talking to people,

381
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,230
wouldn't take help from others,

382
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,640
and always does all things on her own.

383
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,590
But what's so impressive about you is that,

384
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,590
it seems that whatever you want to do,

385
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,800
you can manage it.

386
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,710
I don't know why,

387
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
but I just fell for someone like you,

388
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,880
and very,

389
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,880
very,

390
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,760
very much.

391
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,590
I'm sorry,

392
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,400
that I didn't

393
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,040
keep previous promise.

394
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,070
I caused you too much grief, Ding Xian.

395
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,000
But I promise,

396
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,190
I will make it up to you.

397
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,000
Each equation has a solution,

398
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,310
but love is without solution.

399
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,070
If I had to choose an answer,

400
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,590
then you,

401
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,760
you are my eternal

402
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,560
and only answer.

403
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,350
Ding Xian,

404
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,830
will you

405
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,000
marry me?

406
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,160
Actually,

407
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,110
the one you gave me is enough.

408
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,190
No,

409
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,310
I promised

410
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,140
that I'd give you a new one.

411
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,110
And I will keep my promise.

412
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,520
You've already put it on,

413
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,960
but you haven't answered me yet.

414
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,000
I've already put it on,

415
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,590
and I'm wearing two.

416
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Isn't the answer obvious?

417
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,190
I don't care. I want to hear it.

418
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,110
You wanna hear it but I don't wanna say it.

419
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,370
Come on, just let me have my wish come true.

420
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,070
I will.

421
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,880
No matter how many times, I will.

422
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,400
Mr. Liu.

423
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,190
- Mr. Liu. - Mr. Liu.

424
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,800
Mr. Liu.

425
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,000
You've all come back.

426
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,880
We're back here to visit you.

427
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,880
And you told me that there's nothing going on between you two.

428
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
What did I say?

429
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,800
I was right!

430
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,800
By the way,

431
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,110
wasn't there a girl from the arts class

432
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,970
who was always together with you?

433
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,370
Isn't she back with you?

434
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,070
She just delivered a baby.

435
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,470
She's been married for two years.

436
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,430
Good for her!

437
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,110
When will you two have a baby?

438
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,010
Mr. Liu, she's holding her ceremony next month.

439
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,710
Have you prepared your share of the gift money?

440
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,870
Enough with them, what about you guys?

441
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,080
I'll try to get things done in three years.

442
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,520
You may rest assured.

443
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,800
Seeing all of you being so successful,

444
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm so happy.

445
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,870
Siyue, don't you have a speech to give later?

446
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,389
Yeah.

447
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,520
I think it's about time.

448
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,880
So why don't you go and prepare?

449
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,670
Okay, see you later, Mr. Liu.

450
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,710
See you.

451
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Ding Xian,

452
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,389
please stay for a little while. I have something to talk to you.

453
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,230
Okay.

454
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,520
What is it, Mr. Liu?

455
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,710
This guy,

456
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,230
he's all shiny now, being the honorary alumni,

457
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,320
an upcoming star in technology and all,

458
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,449
you'd never know, back in the days, there's one thing...

459
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,389
You wanna study liberal arts?

460
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,630
Zhou Siyue, you must be kidding me!

461
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,190
Sir, I'm serious.

462
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,000
Choosing science or liberal arts, this cannot be taken lightly.

463
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,760
Once done,

464
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,420
it'll determine your future.

465
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,560
You have to think it through.

466
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,760
I understand, science is where my interest lies.

467
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm not giving it up.

468
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,120
But I could also do well in liberal arts.

469
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,000
This is not about doing well or not.

470
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,190
You'd be wasting your gift!

471
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
I may also be

472
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,280
gifted in liberal arts. Who knows?

473
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,190
You...

474
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,470
Zhou Siyue,

475
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,320
are you out of your mind?

476
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,040
Excuse me.

477
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,840
Sir, this is my application form.

478
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,470
Okay, put it right here.

479
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,760
Zhou Siyue,

480
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,800
I honestly hope that you

481
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,560
consider choosing science.

482
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,190
Yes.

483
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,120
You're right.

484
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,400
It is better to choose science.

485
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,470
So this guy insisted on choosing arts before.

486
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,070
It was because of you, right?

487
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,950
The thing between the two of you,

488
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,950
I understand.

489
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,280
Okay, you could go.

490
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,840
What did Mr. Liu say to you?

491
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,910
Not telling.

492
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,230
You wanna know, go ask him.

493
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,630
That's so funny and can't let me know.

494
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,520
Something's fishy.

495
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,150
Xianxian.

496
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,120
Su.

497
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,470
How are you?

498
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,390
Fine.

499
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,040
It's been a while.

500
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,670
It is.

501
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,850
Why don't you go and wait for me in the hall?

502
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,710
All right.

503
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,150
It's a man's thing. Let them deal with it themselves.

504
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,040
Let's go.

505
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Who'd know,

506
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,920
you can play basketball.

507
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,850
There's a lot that you don't know about me.

508
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,910
Shall we?

509
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,390
Let's have it.

510
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,910
I heard that Ding Xian

511
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,610
sent you an invitation.

512
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,000
Relax.

513
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,360
I'm not going.

514
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,150
I'd probably already be abroad by then.

515
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,560
It's okay if you come.

516
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,760
Am I afraid that you'd take her from me?

517
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,840
You never know.

518
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,310
Still, I have to thank you

519
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,150
for helping Xianxian so much.

520
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,490
But you don't have to do that anymore.

521
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,910
You know what,

522
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,900
if you don't want to give that speech,

523
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,520
I could take your place.

524
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,910
Relax,

525
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
I won't give you that chance.

526
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,470
See you.

527
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,840
Treat her well.

528
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,190
Let's go.

529
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,080
What did you guys do?

530
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,080
Just some catching-up.

531
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,760
Doesn't Su need to give a speech?

532
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,000
Why do you care about him so much?

533
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,060
Then you should...

534
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,720
What are you talking about?

535
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,560
Fine. He said that the speech is too boring.

536
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
He's not coming.

537
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,360
That's more like it.

538
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,640
Where are Song Ziqi and Kong Shadi?

539
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,320
They have something to do, and are off.

540
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,430
Something to do?

541
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,490
Never mind, forget about them. Let's go.

542
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,960
This feels so familiar.

543
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,420
For a second, I feel like I was back

544
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,960
to when we were in the last year of high school.

545
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,840
Many people may think

546
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,040
everything goes so well with me.

547
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,670
But I'm actually no different from you.

548
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,760
There was a time

549
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,080
when I was at great loss.

550
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,600
But luckily for me,

551
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,840
I met someone

552
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,190
who's absolutely adorable,

553
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,470
and nice.

554
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,950
She once said to me

555
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,870
that for a strong person,

556
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,910
no matter what happened

557
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,430
he's gonna carry on with his dreams.

558
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,840
I've had my setbacks.

559
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,710
I've fallen down the abyss.

560
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,710
But every time I was down,

561
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,080
she'd be there,

562
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,650
with a naughty smile on her face, saying,

563
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,600
Zhou Siyue,

564
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,280
I believe in you.

565
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,320
Actually she got it backwards.

566
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,080
I want to tell her today

567
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,950
that actually she

568
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,600
is the only one who I've always held on to,

569
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,760
and see as the truth.

570
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,760
Ding Xian,

571
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,230
thank you.

572
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,120
Where are we going?

573
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,150
You'll see.

574
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,980
Just tell me. Why all the mystery?

575
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,950
It's locked.

576
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,630
Nothing can stop your husband.

577
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,460
We're not married yet. Don't talk like that.

578
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,280
Let's go.

579
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,950
This place looks exactly the same as before.

580
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,630
Feels like nothing's ever changed.

581
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,560
Why did someone

582
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,160
carve an "Early" on the desk?

583
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,710
It looks weird.

584
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,670
Was it you?

585
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,760
Stop copying notes for Ding Xian.

586
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,560
I'm almost finished. Two more minutes.

587
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,870
What is this?

588
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,910
Is it "Ding"?

589
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,120
What?

590
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,910
Isn't this "Early"?

591
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,470
This is "Early".

592
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:30,950
Then what's with this tick here?

593
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,360
Is there?

594
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,800
Yeah.

595
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,910
Ding Xian.

596
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,000
Now that I knew your secret,

597
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,670
do you wanna know mine?

598
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
I already know.

599
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,670
I always knew.

600
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,520
Why did you take my book?

601
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,560
Why are you smiling?

602
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,710
Let's go.
