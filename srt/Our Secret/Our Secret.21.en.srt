Our Secret
EP21

2
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,870
Su,

3
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,120
this original piece by Xianxian

4
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
is very good.

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,479
We can expand it into 200 episodes.

6
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,710
It won't be a problem.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,039
We can also convert it into an animation,

8
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,080
or a game,

9
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,470
something like that.

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
Guaranteed to make a hit!

11
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,880
Director Zhang,

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,509
I can't sign the contract.

14
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,160
Director Zhang, Xianxian has never signed a contract before.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,510
I think she needs some time to think.

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,190
Young lady,

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,550
you've made a promise.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
How can you break it?

19
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,110
I'm really, really sorry.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,000
The artists that I contract with on my comics app

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,240
are all very popular on Weibo.

22
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,190
If you refuse to work with me for your own reasons,

23
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,940
when words get out,

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,390
what do people think of you?

25
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,450
Director Zhang...

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
Young lady,

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,880
you need to learn right from wrong.

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Sign it.

29
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,920
What's right and what's wrong?

30
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,670
Party A and party B.

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,000
Collaborating upon mutual consent.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,800
There's no reason for forced signing.

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,190
Zhou Siyue.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,630
We're talking about Ding Xian's business here.

35
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,230
I'm also doing this for Director Zhang's sake.

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,630
Signing a contract hastily before reaching an agreement,

37
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,290
if anything goes wrong with the project one day,

38
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,550
I don't think you'd want

39
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,550
people to talk about how you made a big mistake, right?

40
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,010
For this piece of work,

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,600
its greatest value is in Ding Xian herself.

42
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,390
It's what she's always had in her.

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,030
So from a business perspective,

44
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,520
Ding Xian

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
is not the best commodity for you, Director Zhang.

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Come on.

47
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,140
Change your shoes.

48
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,600
Why did you bring a pair of shoes?

49
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,200
I got them by the road on my way here.

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,079
It's okay.

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,810
You look so good today.

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,670
Let me do it.

53
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,270
How did you know my feet hurt?

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,470
Because my feet hurt, too.

55
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,770
Do they fit?

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,950
Xianxian.

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,260
Xianxian, I don't quite understand.

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't you want other people to look up to you,

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,070
make a better life,

60
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,720
and become someone...

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,640
Su,

62
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,440
I just want to be the person I want to be.

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,740
I thought we were the same kind of people.

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,270
We used to be.

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Su.

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,410
Director Zhang.

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,550
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,880
What happened today...

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Don't worry about it.

70
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,000
I've given her the opportunity

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,230
for your sake.

72
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,030
I wonder why you help her so much.

73
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,880
If I'm not mistaken,

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,880
you like her?

75
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,210
Director Zhang, let me see you to the car.

76
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,390
Su,

77
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,480
women like this

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,110
love guys like you,

79
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,390
talented and rich.

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,530
Director Zhang,

81
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
I can't agree with what you said.

83
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,150
About the project this time,

84
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,760
I opt out.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,510
I think

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,070
I dreamed of a scene like this.

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,600
You dreamed of me?

88
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,790
You were holding my hand like this in my dream.

89
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,920
At that time, I thought,

90
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,550
I'd never be with you.

91
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,390
So I had a lot of dreams about you.

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

93
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,790
I promise you,

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,110
I won't ever hurt you again.

95
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,390
So,

96
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,600
how are you gonna explain to Xing Lufei?

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,900
It's none of her business.

98
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,670
She likes you.

99
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,510
It's none of my business.

100
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,270
Then should I talk to her...

101
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,800
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,350
Zhou Siyue,

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,070
you are avoiding my question.

104
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,390
I never thought,

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,920
that you would be nervous,

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,000
about people like Xing Lufei.

107
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,760
I never thought,

108
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,110
that you would be nervous about people like Su Bocong.

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,390
How am I nervous?

110
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
You're kidding.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,880
Then who's the one,

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,050
feeling insecure just because

113
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,830
I talked a few words with him?

114
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,720
Ding Xian, I used to think,

115
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,440
I know what I want,

116
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,790
but then I found out,

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,230
if I don't have you in my world,

118
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,040
then everything is meaningless.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
So, on the road ahead,

120
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,550
shall we walk together?

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,110
Zhou Siyue,

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,440
all these years,

123
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,790
I've never really changed.

124
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,390
If I say yes,

125
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,669
you'll never let me go again.

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
I promise you.

127
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,470
We will always,

128
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,080
be together.

129
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,470
This is correct, and...

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,030
there are sixteen rooms altogether, right?

131
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,640
Right.

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,570
And then this...

133
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,080
Zhou Siyue.

134
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,470
Boss, so,

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,030
when we were given awards,

136
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,760
this Mr. Chen from Hongguang Technology wanted you to contact him.

137
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,000
Right,

138
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
did your idea work?

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,770
I figured it out.

140
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,470
The meaning of my life is to eat.

141
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't make super big bucks,

142
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,440
why should I work super hard?

143
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Good morning.

144
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,550
Morning.

145
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,910
I'll take it myself.

146
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,580
Just get on the bus.

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
Hi.

148
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,790
I got it, I got it.

149
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,450
Please sit.

150
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,880
How about I go sit over there?

151
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,710
Just sit here.

152
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,520
Ding Xian,

153
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,590
have you finished the activity report of this Comic-con?

154
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,050
It should be out in our WeChat account today.

155
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,930
When did this become my responsibility?

156
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,230
On our meeting last night.

157
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,830
It was decided on the spot when you were absent.

158
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,790
Okay, I'll do it right away.

159
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,350
It's time to

160
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,230
give the report of the competition, right?

161
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,110
Dong Zhengfei,

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,840
you're the team leader but you don't work at all.

163
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,520
Shame on you.

164
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,150
Yuan Fang.

165
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,320
I'll write it. It's okay.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,260
You can get some sleep.

167
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,720
Thank you, Boss.

168
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,960
Could you help me get my bag?

169
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Thank you.

170
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,810
Would you like some music?

171
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,030
I have finished the report.

172
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,960
And you?

173
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,590
Not yet.

174
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,840
You can get some sleep first.

175
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,550
Okay.

176
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
I didn't know that Zhou,

177
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,000
could be so gentle and considerate.

178
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,640
Me, neither.

179
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's go, Boss.

180
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,450
You can't read social cues at all.

181
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,320
Wake up.

182
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,840
Have we arrived yet?

183
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,470
Hello, Ms. Sun.

184
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,000
Ding Xian.

185
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,670
These last few episodes of "Shadows" are really good.

186
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,160
We thought about it,

187
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,670
and decided to update every three days.

188
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,760
If it's okay,

189
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,220
could you please send me a new draft tonight?

190
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
Tonight?

191
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes, I want it tonight.

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I see.

193
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm gonna have to work on my draft.

194
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,760
See you then.

195
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,280
Zhou Siyue, would you like to have dinner together tonight?

196
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,710
It's okay if you don't want to eat. I know that there's a...

197
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,280
Can you stay away from me?

198
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,670
- See you. - See you.

199
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,880
Do you hate me so much?

200
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,520
I've been chasing you for so long.

201
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,590
Anyone can see, if he's not a fool.

202
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,000
Where am I not as good as her?

203
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,700
She is better than you in everything.

204
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,550
You're kidding me.

205
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,350
It was you who locked Ding Xian in the dressing room

206
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,680
the other day, isn't it?

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
Xing Lufei,

208
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,010
I'm telling you for the last time,

209
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Ding Xian is the only girl I like.

210
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,640
About the thing between you and Director Zhang,

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,790
I already heard.

212
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Why were you so impulsive?

213
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

214
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,350
That was my fault.

215
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,110
I'll try to make up for it.

216
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,840
Su,

217
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,520
do you know why,

218
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,230
I chose you before,

219
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,430
and start a business together with you?

220
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,880
Because you're young,

221
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,160
and you already know what you want.

222
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,990
And you're so motivated,

223
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,910
with a calmness beyond your peers.

224
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
But now it seems that,

225
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,030
you're still too young.

226
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,640
Mr. Ma, I heard you.

227
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,920
Right.

228
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,440
I have a project at hand,

229
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,890
that needs someone in charge to follow up.

230
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
Since you happen to have time,

231
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,520
I'll give this project to you.

232
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
Boss,

233
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,450
waiting for Xianxian's message?

234
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,610
I can't believe you've also come to this.

235
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,510
I guess it's fair luck after all.

236
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,350
I don't seem to remember you getting lucky once, have you?

237
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,310
You're so mean!

238
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,470
Professor Ye.

239
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,560
Siyue.

240
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,280
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology came to me yesterday.

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,010
He's interested in your robot,

242
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,270
and wanted to work with our team.

243
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,920
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology?

244
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,470
Right.

245
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,700
I think I kind of remember him.

246
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,230
I remembered.

247
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,160
It was at the last robot contest,

248
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,280
at the award ceremony,

249
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,940
he asked me to hand over his business card to you.

250
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,080
So what exactly does their company do?

251
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
You don't know?

252
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,680
Hongguang Technology is currently the most authoritative

253
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,280
intelligent robot company in China.

254
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,710
Their main products are

255
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,840
humanoid intelligent robots.

256
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,190
Professor Ye.

257
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,340
I don't really want to work with them.

258
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,400
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,350
Working with Hongguang is not only profitable,

260
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,800
but also you get to collaborate with the top teams in the country.

261
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,920
You're giving up this great opportunity like this?

262
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,470
What are you thinking?

263
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,190
Indeed, Hongguang Technology is very good.

264
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,350
It might even be

265
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,110
our best option at the moment.

266
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
But why,

267
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,680
why does a high-end technology company,

268
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,830
want to work with a team of sophomores?

269
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,680
What's more, the robot technology we have

270
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
is not perfected.

271
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,830
It does not have a relatively clear direction for application.

272
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,880
But

273
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,040
that doesn't mean we won't make progress.

274
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,760
So that's the problem.

275
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,000
Obviously they can go to more accomplished teams,

276
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,110
with more mature performance and techniques.

277
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,230
Or wait for us to grow,

278
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,920
and then come and cooperate with us.

279
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,110
With the timing that they come to us,

280
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,920
I suspect that the cooperation is just an excuse.

281
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,760
Their real purpose

282
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
is to buy out our patents.

283
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
But a buy-out of our patents,

284
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,470
doesn't sound like a bad thing currently, does it?

285
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,280
When we're not sure about whether we share

286
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,160
similar ideas for a cooperation,

287
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,400
selling out our patents would mean,

288
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,110
that we hand over the results

289
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,810
of our year-long research.

290
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,690
Are you willing to do that?

291
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Professor Ye.

292
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,380
I think you should reconsider it.

293
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,190
If Zhou Siyue's not willing to,

294
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,590
I can lead our team and work with Hongguang.

295
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,480
I'll think about it.

296
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,160
Bye, Professor.

297
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,310
After a whole night of working on my draft,

298
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,110
it's so nice to finally get to enjoy some nice food.

299
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,190
Aren't you tired?

300
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,760
Not really.

301
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,230
I like drawing.

302
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,570
So I'm not tired.

303
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,950
It's just...

304
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,280
I ate too much.

305
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,280
Too much?

306
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,810
You ate too much, but you're still buying so many snacks?

307
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,230
For a girl,

308
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,090
we don't use the same stomach for eating dinner and eating snacks.

309
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,410
Is there anything else you want to eat?

310
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,310
I want ice cream.

311
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,040
Isn't that cold?

312
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,800
I'll just take a bite if you buy one.

313
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,530
What about the rest?

314
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You'll finish it.

315
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,560
No I'm not.

316
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,520
Come on!

317
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,890
What flavor do you want?

318
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,430
Blueberry.

319
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,000
Blueberry.

320
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,920
It's so cold.

321
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,810
Just don't eat if it's cold.

322
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,070
No, this is delicious.

323
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,350
Can't be wasted.

324
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,480
Would you like some?

325
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,190
No, it's all yours.

326
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,660
You don't want to eat my leftover?

327
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,400
It's so cold.

328
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,770
Isn't it delicious?

329
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,880
It is good.

330
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,350
I have work to do in my lab.

331
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,210
Why don't you go back first?

332
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,310
So I'll go back to the studio then.

333
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,110
Okay.

334
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,280
See you.

335
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,470
You shouldn't come see her anymore.

336
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,760
What if I'm here for you?

337
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,950
This is a young team from Hua Qing.

338
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,560
They just won the championship in the robot contest.

339
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,590
And they were targeted by Hongguang.

340
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,230
You should get in touch with them.

341
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,040
Talk to them.

342
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,680
Do you want to,

343
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,830
scout them?

344
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,470
It's not them that I want.

345
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,400
I want to know what Hongguang's been up to.

346
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,920
Oh,

347
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,880
I have this document here,

348
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,230
that's maybe of help to you.

349
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm flattered,

350
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,680
but I'm just a student.

351
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,950
I'm not planning on working with any company just yet.

352
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,590
Not working with us,

353
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,950
but working with Hongguang.

354
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,540
You want me to hack information from Hongguang?

355
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,130
I didn't expect you people can

356
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,860
do anything by fair means or foul just for making money.

357
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
I still hope that you could consider.

358
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,280
There's no need for further discussion between us.

359
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,470
I won't do anything illegal.

360
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,950
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

361
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,330
Why don't you take a look at this before you make a decision?

362
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,030
With your health situation,

363
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,880
I keep telling you to walk outside more often, and you just wouldn't listen.

364
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,540
You'd rather stay in the room.

365
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,470
Whenever I walk around,

366
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,400
my brain will be packed with ideas.

367
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Reading brings me some peace.

368
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,230
I won't do anything illegal.

369
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,430
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

370
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,630
Why don't you take a look at this before you decide?

371
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,930
We've found out

372
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,160
the man who set your father up.

373
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,650
Siyue, you're here.

374
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,480
No classes at school?

375
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Class is over.

376
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,760
Here.

377
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,110
Are you feeling any better?

378
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,950
Much better.

379
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,920
I heard that,

380
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,760
you won a prize again.

381
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Well done.

382
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,950
That's because of your teachings.

383
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,450
Here, have some water.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,190
I'm sorry, dad.

385
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,470
What, you're in trouble?

386
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm just...

387
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,520
sorry that I got you worried.

388
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,760
Your mom and I know,

389
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,310
that you're always

390
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,310
a very good boy.

391
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,070
We never worry about you making mistakes.

392
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,490
Whatever you want to do,

393
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,680
just go ahead and do it.

394
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,880
Don't worry.

395
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,230
But what if that thing

396
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,000
takes sacrifices?

397
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,040
It always takes sacrifices.

398
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,000
Doesn't it?

399
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,230
If it didn't happen to us,

400
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,040
I never knew,

401
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,520
that we,

402
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
could be such a happy family.

403
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Mark my words,

404
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,280
no matter what happens,

405
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,720
as long as think it through for yourself, go for it.

406
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,590
I have no regrets.

407
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,760
I just want my son,

408
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,880
to have no regrets, either.

409
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,950
You're gonna recover.

410
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,070
I will.

411
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
It's such a simple thing.

412
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,620
Have you even put any effort in it?

413
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,800
It's so great to be rich.

414
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,760
You can even buy the truth.

415
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,520
But I still refuse.

416
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,190
You won't do it now,

417
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,850
but it doesn't mean you won't do it in the future.

418
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,890
She loves you for your honesty and integrity now,

419
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,980
but one day you're gonna bow before reality.

420
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,640
By that time,

421
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,590
do you think,

422
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,880
that she'll still love you?

423
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,000
I am not the same kind of person like you.

424
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
For me?

425
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Now that the shoes are delivered,

426
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,700
I'll see you later.

427
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,280
What's the rush?

428
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Let's take a look.

429
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,960
How do you like them?

430
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,800
Not bad.

431
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,050
You've got eyes for these.

432
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,710
Of course.

433
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,470
You gotta see who bought them.

434
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,830
Why did you transfer so much?

435
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,000
Of course.

436
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,010
I can't take advantage of you.

437
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,760
Then forget it.

438
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,950
I can't take this.

439
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,170
I've earned money lately.

440
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,710
I got paid 4,000 yuan for this draft.

441
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,110
I feel it's easy for me to make money.

442
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,920
How about this? In the future, you stay home,

443
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,950
and I'll go earn the bread.

444
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,830
You see, you've been so busy lately.

445
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
I feel bad for you.

446
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,840
Look at that smug face of yours.

447
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,120
Happy about earning this little money.

448
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,400
4,000 yuan is not a little.

449
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Plus,

450
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,680
I earn money with my own hands.

451
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880
I don't cheat or

452
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,680
compromise to the reality.

453
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,960
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,190
What if...

455
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
one day you found me changed

456
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,920
into a person not knowing right from wrong,

457
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
what would you do?

458
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,880
Why are you asking that?

459
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,880
Are you in a bad mood?

460
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,560
No.

461
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,000
So?

462
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,280
Is it because of the contest?

463
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,230
No.

464
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Your experiment?

465
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,880
I asked you first,

466
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,690
you gotta answer me first.

467
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,690
Don't forget to stay true to yourself.

468
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,710
I can't imagine

469
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,830
what you would be like if you change.

470
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,760
Hello.

471
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,350
Ding Xian, we've got some copyright issue

472
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,610
with the novel adapted from your comics.

473
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,710
Director Su,

474
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,040
about that blogger of the "Little Monster Diaries",

475
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,440
I think she's in trouble.

476
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
Hello, Director Sun.

477
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Director Sun.

478
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,100
Please have a seat.

479
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,350
Regarding the copyright of "Shadows",

480
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,880
what's the deal with that?

481
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,820
About that copyright,

482
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,570
I'm sorry I didn't make things clear for you.

483
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,680
Look at Article 39.

484
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
After the copyright of "Shadows" expires,

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,640
the copyright of "Shadows",

486
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
should be owned by the artist and the Dream Journey Press.

487
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,080
Dream Journey has the right to the final interpretation.

488
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,220
That's why you shared the copyright with me?

489
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,310
So that I'd share

490
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,800
the risk of infringement?

491
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,830
You can go ask around.

492
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,000
Nowadays, no publishing agency

493
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,760
would share the copyright with their artists.

494
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,280
The reason we're doing this

495
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,710
is for your own good.

496
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,740
But you hid the expiration of the copyright from me!

497
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,360
It's clearly written in the contract.

498
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,470
The profits they made out of the "Shadows" comics,

499
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,350
is totally enough for Dream Journey Publishing

500
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,280
to cover the compensation easily.

501
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,240
I get minimal pay for my work,

502
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,090
but I have to take on half of the compensation.

503
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,350
They've planned it all along.

504
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,180
They made a trap and wait for me to jump in.

505
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,310
It's all right.

506
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,680
It's inevitable to be fooled when you are new in the business.

507
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,920
But when they asked you

508
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,430
to share the copyright,

509
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,440
weren't you suspecting at all?

510
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,110
I didn't think that much.

511
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,710
I thought that there are

512
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,750
always good people in the world.

513
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,950
How silly!

514
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,920
Right.

515
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,190
You are the smartest.

516
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,230
Here.

517
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,520
Have a cup of coffee.

518
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,150
Take it easy.

519
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,000
Your latte art

520
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
is so bad!

521
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm not a professional.

522
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Try it yourself if you're that good.

523
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,670
Why not?

524
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,600
Do it.

525
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,900
How should I start?

526
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,050
Hold the coffee in your left hand,

527
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,909
and hold the milk in your right hand.

528
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,120
Pour slowly little by little from this angle.

529
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,389
Don't rush.

530
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,630
What?

531
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,520
I see that now. I'll do it myself.

532
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
Here.

533
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,430
You're adding too much sugar?

534
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,040
The coffee is too bitter. I prefer the sweet.

535
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,840
Give me a sec.

536
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,670
Here.

537
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,840
Wait.

538
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,470
You take a bite of this,

539
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,000
and then try a sip of coffee.

540
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,280
How is it?

541
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,360
Delicious.

542
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,120
Wait.

543
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,710
Got a stamp on you.

544
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,520
Are you happy now?

545
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,710
Thank you for cheering me up.

546
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,290
So what are you going to do next?

547
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,320
I want to talk to the original author.

548
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,280
It is best to settle this in private.

549
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,150
But there is another thing that is also very important.

550
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,750
You are also a victim of this.

551
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,000
So,

552
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,840
while you talk to the original author,

553
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,740
you'd better also look for

554
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,560
any evidence that the publisher lied to you.

555
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,080
Do you have the contract you signed

556
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,470
or chat records or anything like that?

557
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,430
I'll help you.

558
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,560
I can do it myself.

559
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,160
I know you're worried about me.

560
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,130
But I also have to learn

561
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,920
to solve problems by myself.

562
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,360
Okay.

563
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,960
But what if you can't find any evidence?

564
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,190
Then I'll pay for the compensation.

565
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,250
How much is that?

566
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,910
500,000 yuan.

567
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,020
Don't worry. It's not gonna get that far.

568
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,950
At the worst,

569
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,950
you could hire me.

570
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,910
Professor Ye.

571
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,910
I think I should see Mr. Chen of Hongguang.

572
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,870
Have you been waiting for a long time?

573
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,600
Give me.

574
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,470
No.

575
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,670
Sorry.

576
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,430
It's okay.

577
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
I saw your performance

578
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,360
at the competition.

579
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,910
But

580
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,000
you rejected me before,

581
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,360
didn't you?

582
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,520
Yes.

583
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
I thought,

584
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,210
that I didn't share the same ideas as you.

585
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,870
So I chose to refuse.

586
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,630
Then why now,

587
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,670
you come to me?

588
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,230
Because I need money.

589
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,840
You are very straight-forward.

590
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,000
To be honest,

591
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,760
before,

592
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,190
I just wanted to buy out your robot patent.

593
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,390
But now I've changed my mind.

594
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,040
I want your patent

595
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,230
plus a two-year contract after your graduation.

596
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,470
Name your price.

597
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,560
500,000 yuan.

598
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,470
Si Yue.

599
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,560
If it's okay,

600
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,040
I want the money now.

601
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,000
Don't be so hasty, young man,

602
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,910
we still have to wait,

603
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,520
for the procedures of the contract, don't we?

604
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,360
Okay.

605
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,110
Then I'll be waiting.

606
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,040
Hello?

607
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,910
Hello, Ding Xian.

608
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,800
I've got your 500,000 yuan.

609
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,670
I'll clarify the plagiarism case for you

610
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,520
on Weibo in a moment.

611
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,470
Don't worry.

612
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,870
But I didn't send you any money.

613
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,280
A gentleman contacted me yesterday,

614
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,560
saying that he'll help you with the money.

615
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,690
Don't you know that?

616
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,280
So... could you tell me,

617
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,470
the name of that man?

618
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,390
Su,

619
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,320
I've been looking all over for you.

620
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,600
Xianxian,

621
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,600
why are you here?

622
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,530
Thank you for paying the money for me.

623
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,100
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

624
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,190
That's...

625
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,730
That's the only thing I can do for you.

626
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,470
Su, are you all right?

627
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,120
Are you okay?

628
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,470
I'm okay. I'm okay.

629
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,390
I'm okay. Just go. See you later.

630
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,800
It's okay. You don't have to worry about me. I'm okay.

631
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,710
What can I do?

632
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,690
Maybe I should just get you home first?

633
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,710
Su.

634
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,000
Su.

635
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,190
Can you get up?

636
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,390
Be careful!

637
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,120
Where are you going, young lady?

638
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,340
Just a minute, sir.

639
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,840
Su.

640
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,950
Su, where do you live?

641
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,320
Su?

642
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,390
Jiangnan Avenue.

643
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,230
Jiangnan Avenue.

644
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,320
All right.

645
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,650
Here we are, young lady.

646
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,760
Su.

647
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,190
Wake up!

648
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,390
Jiangnan Avenue and?

649
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,200
Hey, young lady, are you getting off or not?

650
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,560
What should I do?

651
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,280
Su, we're there.

652
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,600
You...

653
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,710
Su, you are too heavy!

654
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,800
Su.

655
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,150
You're drunk!

656
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,630
If I weren't drunk,

657
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,150
I'd never be able to say this.

658
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,710
Ding Xian,

659
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,710
I love you.

660
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,710
Su.

661
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm already in a relationship.

662
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,520
I see.

663
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,360
Sorry about that.

664
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
You should go home and get some rest.

665
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,190
Zhou Siyue.

666
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,120
Zhou Siyue.

667
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,800
Director Su,

668
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,660
there is someone waiting for you in your office.

669
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,840
Zhou Siyue.

670
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,560
There is 500,000 yuan in this card.

671
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,130
The password is Ding Xian's birthday.

672
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,630
Please tell Xianxian,

673
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,670
I'm sorry.

674
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,800
What did you do to her?

675
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,470
I am warning you.

676
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,760
Leave her alone!

677
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,600
I'm about to lose my patience.
