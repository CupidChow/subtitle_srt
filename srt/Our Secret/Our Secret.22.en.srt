Our Secret
EP22

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,950
I'm back.

3
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,400
Finally.

4
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,479
Your computer has been ringing for a day.

5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,800
Come and see!

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Let me take a look.

7
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,800
I see.

8
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,550
Have a try.

9
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,750
Wow, Childe Zhou has even learned how to cook.

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,079
Too bad I could only have instant noodles in high school.

11
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,470
Eat or not?

12
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,440
Sure.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,750
This one.

14
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,829
Is it good?

15
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,550
Nice.

16
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,610
So much better than before!

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,880
How did you do that?

18
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,000
When my dad was in hospital,

19
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,160
I cooked for him.

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,240
How is he now?

21
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,550
He's fine, except that his heart has a little problem.

22
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,150
Thanks to timely discovery,

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,390
the treatment

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,670
was effective.

25
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,110
Good then.

26
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,420
Continue.

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,220
Oh, right.

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,690
Here are your five hundred thousand yuan.

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,670
Where did you get it?

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,030
Is it my turn?

31
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,200
I'd like to hear your answer first.

32
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,810
Where did you get five hundred thousand?

33
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,190
I...

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,240
I sold the patent of robots

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,300
that won me a prize.

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,520
You sold it?

37
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,910
You worked so hard for it.

38
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,970
What are you going to do in the future?

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,240
Future?

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,570
I can invent another one in the future.

41
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,680
You still haven't told me your answer.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I explained

43
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,670
all details on my Vlog.

44
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,910
And many painters came to me

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,810
saying they were cheated by Dream Journey Press.

46
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,110
Then,

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,950
we informed against this company jointly.

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,030
And it was under investigation.

49
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,110
Great!

50
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,910
I have another good news.

51
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,600
The author of "Shadows"

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,390
loves my comics very much.

53
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,440
He decided to give me his copyright,

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,269
so that I could continue to make adaptions.

55
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,870
He even signed a profit share contract with me.

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,550
I can draw my original comics in the future.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,760
Do you think it's good to

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,740
draw our stories in comics?

59
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,950
What do you think?

60
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,640
What do you think?

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,540
What are you doing?

62
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,670
Do you think

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,480
I talk too much?

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,230
No, you're cute.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,790
Why are you laughing?

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,480
You still keep it.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,600
So, have you

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,160
seen everything?

69
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,160
Have I seen what?

70
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,390
The secret diary.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Didn't you mean to let me notice it?

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,720
20121221

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,790
But,

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,950
I always wonder.

75
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,040
Hello, I'm April.

76
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm so tired, April.

77
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,350
What's this?

78
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,320
So you've found it already.

79
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
You told me

80
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,520
that you wanted a star shining forever.

81
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,550
When

82
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,070
did I say that?

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,850
You don't remember?

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,070
I want to have

85
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,920
a star that will never dim.

86
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,950
That's a big dream.

87
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,390
So,

88
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,790
from that moment, you...

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,270
What?

90
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,870
How is that possible?

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
I made this to encourage you in case that

92
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,050
you might be tired in the repeating grade.

93
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,880
Looks like it worked.

94
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm so tired, Siyue.

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,640
Zhou Siyue.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Tell me,

97
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,760
when did you start to like me?

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,270
Tell me. I wanna know.

99
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,320
It's a secret.

100
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,320
Your phone.

101
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,110
Hey, mom.

102
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,760
Xianxian, you winter vacation is coming, right?

103
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,090
When will you come back?

104
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,190
I'll be back in two or three days.

105
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,550
Dad, mom,

106
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,790
I'm back.

107
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,660
Xianxian, it's good to have you back.

108
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,900
Good to see you, uncle.

109
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,640
Siyue.

110
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,110
Good to see you.

111
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you for bringing presents.

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,350
Wanxian, come on. Siyue.

113
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,160
Good to see you, aunt.

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,830
I haven't see you for over one year.

115
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,490
And you've become slenderer.

116
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,570
You need to eat more today.

117
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,790
Why do you two...

118
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,080
Ding Xian said she would come back for the Spring Festival.

119
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,480
I wanted come back too, so we came together.

120
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,789
It's nice to have you two back together.

121
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,840
Come on in.

122
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,789
How's your father now?

123
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,350
He's still under medical observation.

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
In Jiangling.

125
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,790
Okay.

126
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,110
Wash your hands and let's have lunch.

127
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,370
Have more cups of drink with me this time.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
You don't need to change shoes.

129
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,170
Wine. I have good wine here.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,900
Go wash your hands.

131
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,840
Come on, Siyue, take a seat.

132
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,170
So many kinds of dishes.

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,500
No, you're the guest, take your seat.

134
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Take it.

135
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,910
You seem happier to see him than see me.

136
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Of course.

137
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,280
Siyue is such an excellent kid.

138
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,400
He was recommended to Huaqing University

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,840
with decent personality.

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,770
Everyone will be happy to meet him.

141
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,170
This is my collected wine.

142
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,810
Let's have some cups later.

143
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,950
Just sit down. Ding Juncong.

144
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,280
Lunch is ready.

145
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm not hungry. You go first.

146
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,220
Don't you want to see your sister?

147
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,590
I'm telling you,

148
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,550
Ding Juncong

149
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,350
is in puberty, a rebellious period.

150
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,470
Just ignore him.

151
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,100
All because you spoil him.

152
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,710
Siyue, you're Xianxian's senior.

153
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,470
On campus,

154
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,200
please take more care of her.

155
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,790
Of course, I'll take good care of her.

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,790
And remember to watch out for her.

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,510
She will indulge herself

158
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,080
if no one is supervising her.

159
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,110
I won't.

160
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,790
I hope so.

161
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,790
If I know that

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,080
all you know is pleasure and dating,

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,470
after spending so much effort to go to Huaqing University,

164
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,930
You will get your lessons.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,710
Mom,

166
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,470
I'm an adult now.

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,520
Why can't I date?

168
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,550
No, you can't.

169
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,080
Such a waste of time！

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Enough, enough.

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't nag anymore.

172
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,230
She's old enough to date anyone. Don't interfere.

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
She's my daughter no matter how old she is.

174
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,910
I have the right.

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,710
Okay, okay.

176
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
Don't mind them.

177
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,080
Let's drink our wine.

178
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,940
Come on, Siyue.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,670
Welcome.

180
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,790
Thank you, uncle.

181
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,910
Siyue.

182
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,810
Leave it for me. You are guest.

183
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,160
It's fine, aunt.

184
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,120
I often wash dishes at home.

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Let me do it.

186
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,770
It's fine, really.

187
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,080
Mom, just drop it. I'll do it.

188
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,210
Can I trust you two?

189
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't worry, aunt. We can handle this.

190
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,110
Come on.

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,030
Let the kids do it.

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,150
Let's go.

193
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,180
Find something else to do if you are terribly bored.

194
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,710
What?

195
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,350
Aren't you worried?

196
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,550
Why don't we

197
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,110
just tell them?

198
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
No.

199
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,030
What if my mom beats me?

200
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,840
Then I'll stand in front of you,

201
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,100
so she can only beat me.

202
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,470
What if she makes me break up with you?

203
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,590
Then I'll beg her,

204
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,110
until she agrees.

205
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,170
What if she doesn't want me to go home anymore?

206
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,520
Then,

207
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
she won't let me enter the house either.

208
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,710
No, forget it.

209
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,440
You will leave

210
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,640
in two or three days.

211
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,910
And I'll have to face them all by myself.

212
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,760
Tell me!

213
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,200
Who is the "sweetheart" in your contact list?

214
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,550
Ouch, ouch.

215
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,110
Tell me.

216
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,360
Who is the "sweetheart"?

217
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,520
Tell me.

218
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,550
Who is the "sweetheart"?

219
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
I can't believe it.

220
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,750
You are in great trouble.

221
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
Where is my feather duster?

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,400
-Don't, mom. -Move away.

223
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
Help me.

224
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,440
Pray for yourself.

225
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
Sweetheart.

226
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Brother-in-law,

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,670
Please help me!

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,650
What did you call me?

229
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
Brother-in-law.

230
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,110
You're a clever boy.

231
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,710
Go, go, stop her.

232
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,710
-Move away. -Mom.

233
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,470
Got out of the way, Siyue.

234
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,030
Aunt.

235
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,550
Alright, stop.

236
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,940
-Siyue, get out of the way. -Please calm down.

237
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,610
Get out of the way, Siyue.

238
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,280
I must teach him a lesson, or he won't learn.

239
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,080
Don't beat him. You don't have to beat him.

240
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,030
What are you doing?

241
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,470
He deserves it, aunt.

242
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,200
But,

243
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,370
you can't have an answer even if you beat him.

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Ding Juncong,

245
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,640
you're lucky that there's a guest. I'll let it go this time.

246
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,550
Wait and see.

247
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,440
Calm down, aunt.

248
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
He's in puberty.

249
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
This is so irritating.

250
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,200
Siyue.

251
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,320
Can you...

252
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
No problem, aunt.

253
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,470
I'm free recently.

254
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,080
I can help Juncong

255
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,400
with his lessons.

256
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,660
And help you watch him.

257
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,200
Siyue is so considerate.

258
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,150
I wonder

259
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
who will have the bliss to marry him.

260
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,720
Who is the "sweetheart"?

261
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,710
Is the one with a claw braid

262
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,000
or the one in a short skirt?

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,660
What are you doing, Ding Xian?

264
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,960
Brat,

265
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,640
mind your manners.

266
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,960
Do your homework.

267
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,110
I got it.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,330
There is something wrong between you two.

269
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,440
Just focus on your homework.

270
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,590
You two were dating in high school.

271
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,720
How can you blame me?

272
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,890
Who said we were dating in high school?

273
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,200
We weren't.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
She has a crush on me, that's all.

275
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,710
Didn't you have a crush on me too?

276
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,200
You two are lame.

277
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,680
It's none of your business.

278
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,470
Solve your problems first.

279
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,910
Who is that sweetheart?

280
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,670
It's not what you think.

281
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,110
You two are so bad.

282
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,130
I'll report your thing to mom.

283
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,280
Sit down.

284
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,550
Don't tell mom.

285
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,710
You're dead if you tell her.

286
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,280
You're bullying me.

287
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,640
That's only the start.

288
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,400
Take out your homework. I'll teach you.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,790
Please teach him well then.

290
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
It causes me headache to look at his homework.

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,580
Concentrate on it.

292
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,380
Come on, buddy.

293
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't want to do my homework, brother-in-law.

294
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm hungry.

295
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,470
I want to eat something.

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,840
What did you call me?

297
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,230
Brother-in-law.

298
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't eat so much, stop.

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,230
That's enough.

300
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,110
It's fine. Go on.

301
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,520
You're spoiling him.

302
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,010
He doesn't eat any dishes at home,

303
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,150
except some snacks.

304
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,040
What's wrong with it?

305
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,880
You had plenty of snacks in high school.

306
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,160
You want some for yourself, right?

307
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,550
Come on, try it.

308
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,580
What are you two doing?

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Don't just focus on your snacks.

310
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,090
You need to finish that test paper too.

311
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,740
I'll give you explanation on your problems.

312
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,710
Where do you live tonight?

313
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,310
Your place.

314
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,280
No, what if my mom finds out?

315
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,120
Why don't you just tell her?

316
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,080
Do your homework.

317
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,630
Don't listen to adults' conversation.

318
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,640
Then

319
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,400
you'll have to go to my place.

320
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,950
Your place?

321
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,350
Let's do it.

322
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,090
How long will it take to clean it up?

323
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,000
I remember I have some unfinished business at home.

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
I gotta go now.

325
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
You've entered my home.

326
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,950
Do you think you can leave so easily?

327
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,920
I haven't entered yet.

328
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,560
I haven't.

329
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,660
Siyue.

330
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm bringing you quilts.

331
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,880
Thank you, aunt.

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,350
I remember

333
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,230
your house hasn't been cleaned for a long time,

334
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,110
so you could use it when you sleep.

335
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,520
Why are you flushing?

336
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,920
It's hot here, mom.

337
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,230
Don't you think?

338
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,310
It's hot indeed.

339
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,640
You wear too much.

340
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,760
Siyue,

341
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,160
if you feel uncomfortable at night,

342
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,800
come and sleep in our house.

343
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,590
You can sleep in Juncong's room.

344
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,850
There's no need, aunt.

345
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
I can sleep here.

346
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,430
It's fine.

347
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,470
Okay.

348
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,950
Tomorrow morning,

349
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,710
come and have breakfast at our place.

350
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,470
You like golden cakes, don't you?

351
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,400
I'll make them for you.

352
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,070
Okay.

353
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,970
Are you leaving with me or not?

354
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,230
Yes, yes.

355
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,600
Something is wrong.

356
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
So wrong.

357
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you feel that something is wrong

358
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,310
between Xianxian and Siyue?

359
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,370
I think there's something wrong with you.

360
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,680
What? I'm enjoying it.

361
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,310
I must ask them.

362
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,800
Ding Juncong.

363
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,110
Come here.

364
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,190
Do you know anything?

365
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,040
I...

366
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,590
I don't know.

367
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,310
Don't give him a hard time.

368
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,000
Why are you so inquisitive?

369
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,310
What do you want?

370
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,160
You can go to sleep if you have nothing else to do.

371
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,690
Don't be such a stickybeak.

372
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,310
Tell me,

373
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,310
what do you know?

374
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,000
Ding Juncong,

375
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,780
whenever you lie, you stare at the floor.

376
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,590
Tell me.

377
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,040
Alright, I can tell you.

378
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,490
But give my phone back.

379
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm sorry, brother-in-law.

380
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
Zhou Siyue

381
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,710
is her sweetheart.

382
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm going to bed.

383
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,520
Xianxian.

384
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,720
Dad.

385
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,860
Don't stare at your phone.

386
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,410
Your eyesight is failing.

387
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,480
Who are you texting?

388
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,430
Nobody.

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,470
Being young is so great.

390
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,830
I think so.

391
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,560
It reminds me of the days when your mom and I were young.

392
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,560
We had so much to say to each other.

393
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,480
And even a little thing could make us so happy.

394
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,280
Me too.

395
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,430
Just seeing him can make me happy.

396
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,710
Dad,

397
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,190
how could you scam secret out of me like that?

398
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,470
I did not.

399
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,110
I've long known

400
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,440
your little secret.

401
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,310
You're texting Siyue, aren't you?

402
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,280
I'm 21 now.

403
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,050
I can have a relationship.

404
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,430
I'm here to tell you,

405
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,830
I watched Siyue grow up,

406
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,610
and I'm glad to see you two being together.

407
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,800
Thank you, dad.

408
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,310
You understand me.

409
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,560
But,

410
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,070
if your mom does something to you,

411
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,190
don't be mad.

412
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
You know her. She loves being a stickybeak.

413
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,920
Why would she be mad?

414
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,710
Alright, sleep early.

415
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,710
Drink them.

416
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,920
Mom.

417
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,770
You said you were going to make golden cakes.

418
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,800
Congee is good enough for you.

419
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,230
Congee is good.

420
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,470
Siyue.

421
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,880
Come on.

422
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,280
Have more.

423
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,040
You're still growing.

424
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,000
And you're so thin.

425
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,190
Thank you, aunt.

426
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,920
Don't peek.

427
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,570
You should also have more.

428
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm already full, mom.

429
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Well,

430
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I remember

431
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,880
I must leave now for something important.

432
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,140
It's Spring Festival. What is so urgent?

433
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,060
School's affairs.

434
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,520
I heard there is a student...

435
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,590
Hello?

436
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,840
How's the breakfast, brother-in-law?

437
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,260
Mom has already known.

438
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,760
When did it begin?

439
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,070
Aunt.

440
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,170
We weren't together until last month.

441
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
You two kept it from me together.

442
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,190
Is it funny?

443
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,080
It's my fault, aunt.

444
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,480
I should have taken care of her earlier.

445
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,540
What have you done to my daughter?

446
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,170
What are you talking about?

447
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,950
No, aunt,

448
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,440
don't take me wrong.

449
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,920
I mean,

450
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,350
I have been

451
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,910
disappointing her for too long.

452
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
So I'll do my best

453
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,910
to offer her the best.

454
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,470
Don't be angry, mom.

455
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm angry.

456
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

457
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,920
You told me that

458
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,470
I couldn't date anyone.

459
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,920
So I didn't tell you.

460
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,430
But you didn't tell me it was Siyue.

461
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,230
He is such a hard-working kid.

462
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
If you learn from him,

463
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,350
I will support you.

464
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,230
Aunt,

465
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,430
actually,

466
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,680
I should thank Ding Xian.

467
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,310
Without her,

468
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,110
maybe I'll still

469
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,640
live a depressing life.

470
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,800
Siyue.

471
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,980
It's nice that you and Xianxian can be happy.

472
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,760
She's my only daughter.

473
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,920
Please be nice to her.

474
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,020
You like golden cakes, don't you?

475
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,230
I've made for you.

476
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,400
Wait.

477
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,710
Are you still full?

478
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,880
I feel that I don't need to eat anything

479
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,140
in the next three days.

480
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,680
You're leaving again.

481
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,830
When can we spend Spring Festival together?

482
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,920
Professor Ye has a new program,

483
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,350
and I need to keep my parents' company.

484
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,920
I understand.

485
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,180
The proper business matters.

486
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,560
Be cheerful.

487
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,000
Alright, go home now.

488
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,700
Or your parents will worry about you.

489
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,070
I want to stay with you longer.

490
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
No,

491
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,220
or it will be too difficult for me to say goodbye.

492
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,190
Then, give me a hug.

493
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,590
Okay.

494
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,890
We'll see each other soon.

495
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,710
Hug me longer.

496
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,160
Hold me tighter.

497
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,070
The doctor said,

498
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,880
your father is in unstable condition.

499
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Go and see him.

500
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,040
I want to go home.

501
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,250
When you've recovered,

502
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,070
we can go home.

503
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,350
Okay.

504
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,350
I'm aging.

505
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,110
Now I always recall the past.

506
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
I remember when you were a kid,

507
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,520
the art teacher

508
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,590
asked you to make bookmarks.

509
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,880
You didn't want to make them.

510
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,800
So, you picked up a leaf on your way home.

511
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
I remember it.

512
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,430
Teacher praised me at that time.

513
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,110
She said I was innovative.

514
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,000
However,

515
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,760
when I went back home,

516
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,560
you scolded me.

517
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,680
I rarely came back home,

518
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,470
but still left you unpleasant memories.

519
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,190
Actually, when I was little,

520
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,520
I envied Song Ziqi.

521
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,350
Whatever he did,

522
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,820
his dad would be there for him,

523
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,350
praised him

524
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,310
and encouraged him.

525
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,520
But when I was little,

526
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,070
you were strict to me.

527
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,560
You taught me that

528
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,240
I need to take on every responsibility.

529
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,880
Be excellent and independent.

530
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,590
I didn't understand back then.

531
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,470
So, I felt stressful,

532
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,110
tired and hard.

533
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,400
But now I understand it all.

534
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,310
If I can be a little help

535
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,230
for you and mom,

536
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,070
I'll be happy.

537
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,880
You wouldn't

538
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,590
say these things to me before.

539
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,590
You wouldn't listen to me, either.

540
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,000
Brat.

541
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Hey, Shadi.

542
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,710
Hey, Xianxian.

543
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,950
Guess where we are.

544
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,830
Where are you?

545
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,160
Little Monster.

546
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
When did you come back?

547
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,110
Just today.

548
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,040
I heard that Keke came back too.

549
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Come and hang out with us tomorrow.

550
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,430
Okay.

551
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,800
Which one do you want, Kong Shadi?

552
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
This one or that one? I'll hang up.

553
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
See you tomorrow.

554
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
What are you doing recently?

555
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,230
Enjoy.

556
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,950
I'm busy thinking about you.

557
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,800
Can you two stop whispering since we hang out for fun?

558
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,730
You can go out if you have a problem.

559
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,880
Alright, go on.

560
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
I'll pick the songs.

561
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,310
Keke!

562
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,350
Jiang Chen?

563
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier, brother?

564
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,760
I thought you wouldn't come back for the festival.

565
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
I wanted to surprise you.

566
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,530
Where is Zhou Siyue?

567
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,040
He went back to Jiangling to deal with somethings.

568
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,900
Don't mind him.

569
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,470
Today is our girls party.

570
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,800
Then why did you bring your man here?

571
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,880
Yeah.

572
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,970
He insisted on coming here with me.

573
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,420
And you're blaming me?

574
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,040
You brought your man too.

575
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,640
He is not my man.

576
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,520
I feel insecure when I go back home at night.

577
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,780
So, he's my bodyguard.

578
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,830
Bodyguard.

579
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,190
What's this?

580
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,520
Did you get her or not?

581
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Don't mention it.

582
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,770
We're in same situations.

583
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,080
I'm not.

584
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,020
I heard that Zhou Ziyue had met your parents.

585
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,909
It's going pretty fast.

586
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,320
He did.

587
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,710
But,

588
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,230
I don't think anything is in progress.

589
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,159
What do you mean?

590
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,340
It feels we are still acting like we were in high school.

591
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Nothing has changed.

592
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,889
Where exactly are you now?

593
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,630
We've held hands,

594
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,360
and kissed.

595
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,280
That's all?

596
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,320
I understand.

597
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,770
Does he still treat you as a kid?

598
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,630
Maybe.

599
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
Please be confident.

600
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,840
He is treating you as a kid.

601
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,230
You two

602
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,890
are nothing like a couple.

603
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,710
What took you so long?

604
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,150
I just finished the things at the laboratory.

605
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,190
Are you tired?

606
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,280
Ding Xian.

607
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,040
You must let him know

608
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
that you're a girl.

609
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,430
You need to tease him appropriately,

610
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,490
so that he wants to protect you.

611
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,190
Sweetheart,

612
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,950
I feel cold.

613
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,150
What's wrong?

614
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,120
I'm cold.

615
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,450
You don't have a fever.

616
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,320
I've been waiting you for so long.

617
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,580
Don't you think you should do something?

618
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,710
Wait.

619
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Come on, it's still hot.

620
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,280
Warm your hands with it.

621
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,530
Do you feel better?

622
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,430
Let's grab some food after we put away the luggage.

623
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,150
Maybe not today.

624
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,520
A project in the laboratory

625
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,040
needs to be done soon.

626
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,710
Let me walk you to the dormitory.

627
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,040
Thanks.

628
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,870
But I need to go shopping.

629
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,240
Then I'm leaving now.

630
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,630
Ding Xian.

631
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,200
Are you really not going to have dinner?

632
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,320
No, I don't have any appetite.

633
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
Where's your boyfriend?

634
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,560
You haven't seen him for a vacation.

635
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,020
Don't you want to meet him?

636
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,670
He stays in the laboratory all the time.

637
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,710
I just met him,

638
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,340
and he went back again.

639
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,280
Is he so obsessed with academic research?

640
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,840
Go ahead.

641
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,120
We'll bring you snacks back.

642
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,800
Go.

643
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,000
We're leaving.

644
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,600
I'm done.

645
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,690
I'm downstairs at your dormitory.

646
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,040
Studying?

647
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,430
Are you serious?

648
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,630
I heard that

649
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,950
in this semester,

650
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,870
Profess Wang's courses are troublesome.

651
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,600
I can help you prepare for them.

652
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,040
But I haven't had supper yet.

653
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,120
I've prepared it for you.

654
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,440
It's your favorite cake.

655
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,360
There's plenty of them for your roommates too.

656
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,470
But I want to have supper with you.

657
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,230
No need, I've had it.

658
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,600
Have you figured out

659
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,670
the question I explained to you last time?

660
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,630
This one.

661
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,760
No.

662
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
It's fine.

663
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,710
I'll do it first,

664
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,950
and think about this method.

665
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,710
D, C.

666
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,950
Professor Wang wants me to read a book,

667
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,870
but I can't find where it is.

668
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,630
What book?

669
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,160
Come and look for it with me.

670
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,630
What book?

671
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,910
Where is it?

672
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,320
What's the name?

673
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,670
Is it here?

674
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,040
I don't think so.

675
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,760
Here?

676
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,230
This one?

677
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,910
I'm back.

678
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,360
What's that?

679
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,080
Zhou Siyue bought it. He wanted us to share.

680
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
He's so sweet.

681
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,630
Why do you look so depressed?

682
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,190
It feels nothing has changed.

683
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,760
Is it because

684
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,320
you two are too familiar with each other?

685
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,040
Maybe as time goes,

686
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,470
you two don't feel fresh anymore.

687
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,800
Really?

688
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,910
What should I do then?

689
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I think

690
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
you can change yourself.

691
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,910
Change myself?

692
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,630
Look.

693
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,360
I barely recognize you, you know that?

694
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,760
I thought it was our campus belle.

695
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,360
Yeah.

696
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,240
You want to find our boss?

697
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,710
He just left.

698
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,840
Then I'll go and find him.

699
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,600
Okay, bye.

700
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
I don't know why our boss is so lucky.

701
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,800
Good then.

702
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Remember,

703
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,040
if you have anything you don't understand,

704
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,280
come and ask me.

705
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,040
If you have any problems in academic research...

706
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
Zhou Siyue!

707
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,040
Do you miss me?

708
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,160
I just saw you yesterday.

709
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,800
You should still miss me today.

710
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,280
Okay, I'm leaving.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,280
Okay.

712
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,950
What's wrong?

713
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,470
Are you mad?

714
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,710
I know why you ignored me recently.

715
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,470
Did I say yes too quickly?

716
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,320
What is going on

717
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,840
in your little head?

718
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,000
That is

719
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,320
our software engineering teacher.

720
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,520
An elective subject.

721
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
An elective subject?

722
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,190
To get in her class,

723
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,320
Yuan Fang secretly changed my class schedule.

724
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,520
Why would I lie to you?

725
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,230
Why do you dress like this?

726
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,630
Is it pretty?

727
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,870
Yes.

728
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,320
But you might get arthritis dressing this way.

729
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,650
It's cold recently.

730
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,710
Wear pants next time.

731
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,710
Okay?

732
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,000
Why do you act like an old man?

733
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,390
What?

734
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,120
Did I say something wrong again?

735
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,520
Do you still treat me like a kid?

736
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,150
You always act like we were in high school.

737
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,390
You help me with lessons and take care of me.

738
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,630
But the relationship between us

739
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,560
has changed.

740
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,750
I want to stay with you every day.

741
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,520
I want you to compliment my dress.

742
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
And I want to hear you say you like me.

743
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,560
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
I'm too stupid.

745
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,390
I misunderstood you every day,

746
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,530
and ignored your feelings.

747
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,480
But I won't do that anymore.

748
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,470
I like you.

749
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,630
I like you a lot.

750
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,630
Then you know why I'm mad, don't you?

751
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,710
I know.

752
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,080
Come on.

753
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,920
Let's have lunch together.

754
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,910
Your cake.

755
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,520
Thank you.

756
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,450
You're welcome.

757
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,360
Come on.

758
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,040
Wait, I want to take a photo.

759
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,430
Okay.

760
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,430
Okay?

761
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,620
Take this.

762
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,950
Good?

763
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,000
Look.

764
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,720
Yeah.

765
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,230
Here we are.

766
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,120
Thank you for walking me here.

767
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,630
Alright.

768
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Go up there.

769
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,520
I want a hug.

770
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,150
Okay.

771
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,760
Go.

772
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,090
I'll watch you leaving.

773
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,090
I'll watch you going upstairs.

774
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,670
You go first.

775
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,040
Come on, listen to me.

776
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm leaving now.

777
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,470
I can't.

778
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,530
The door is locked.

779
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
If you can't go back,

780
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,760
you'll have to stay here for one night.

781
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,080
Wear these.

782
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,230
Take a seat.

783
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,280
I'll get you cleaning items.
