Our Secret
EP19

2
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,160
Is it here?

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,680
Are you sure that you got rid of them?

4
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,550
I seem to hear Song Ziqi's voice.

5
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,910
This is not something we can afford to be careless about.

6
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,229
If she appears at the door the next moment,

7
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,630
I'd die, no kidding.

8
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,310
Seriously.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
You have no idea

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,630
that I have not slept well for the past few days.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
I have nightmares every night.

12
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,270
It's here, I think.

13
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,870
Zhou Siyue

14
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,190
Song Ziqi, open the door.

15
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,310
Song Ziqi, open the door.

16
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,000
I know you're here.

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,720
Don't hide in there and not speak!

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
Song Ziqi

19
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,110
Open the door.

20
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,360
Shut up.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
Song Ziqi

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,030
Song Ziqi. Get the heck out.

23
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,550
I know you are here.

24
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,240
Come out now.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,270
You are being suspended, so what?

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you have to hide here and get so sullen about it?

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
Get out of the bathroom!

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,320
Hello.

29
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,670
You douchebag! You...

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,030
There's no need to...

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,910
Don't stop me.

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,670
Shadi, calm down first.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,670
You two get out.

34
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,470
I want to talk to him alone.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,550
No...

36
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,360
No, you...

37
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,440
How about

38
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,160
I take you back to school?

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,440
My bag is still in there.

40
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I'd better wait outside.

41
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Can't you go easy on me?

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,270
If you hurt me, I won't be able to become a pilot.

43
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,240
You still want to be a pilot?

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,550
Aren't you trying to stay away from everyone?

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,829
Aren't you running away?

46
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,630
You didn't pick up your phone.

47
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,800
Your QQ is off-line.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
And you just sent me a message,

49
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,600
telling me that I should never try to find you.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,360
Song Ziqi, who do you think you are?

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
Why did you treat me like that?

52
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,030
I am sorry.

53
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,390
Sorry?

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,550
You are just being suspended.

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,829
Big deal?

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,670
Do you need to avoid me like the plague?

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
Calm down.

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,510
I can't calm down.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,550
Can't you just man up?

60
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,440
You said you wanted to be with me.

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,720
You said you wanted to be a pilot.

62
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,320
And it was you who insisted on our long-distance relationship.

63
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,830
And now, something went wrong.

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,270
All you want to do is to hide. Not dare to confront it.

65
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,070
Song Ziqi, are you still a man?

66
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,110
Enough!

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,880
Ding Xian

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,670
Actually...

69
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,920
Sweet potatoes.

70
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,200
Boss, give me a sweet potato please.

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,350
Ten yuan for two.

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Okay.

73
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,200
I forgot my bag.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,390
You forgot to bring your money?

75
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
Young man, your girlfriend doesn't have money with her.

76
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,950
Come and pay!

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,600
Song Ziqi

78
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,760
I miss you.

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,270
Go back.

80
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,440
I'm late for the flight already.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
Then catch the next one.

82
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,720
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,440
Go back, please.

84
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,920
I am not going back.

85
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,510
I can't let you run away anymore.

86
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,790
So, are you here to save me?

87
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,110
I...

88
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,790
I came for the money!

89
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,760
What money?

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
100 yuan for a kiss.

91
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,160
You can count how many times you kissed me.

92
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,640
Hold on.

93
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,670
Enough?

94
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,480
If it is not enough, I will give you my credit card.

95
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,920
Take it.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
You douchebag!

97
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,760
Thank you.

98
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,440
I will pay you back later.

99
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,670
No need.

100
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,230
Shadi

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,110
Did you see Shadi?

102
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,110
Isn't she inside?

103
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
No, she just rushed out.

104
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,760
Did you see her?

105
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,830
No.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,350
Call her.

107
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,640
She won't pick up.

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
What are you guys doing?

109
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,270
Shadi

110
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,070
I am sorry. It was my fault.

111
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,000
I wasn't thinking straight. That wasn't me.

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,110
I am sorry, Shadi.

113
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,000
Song Ziqi, let go of me.

114
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,880
No, I won't.

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,790
No.

116
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,350
You don't know anything but running around.

117
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,880
If something really happens to you,

118
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,070
I...

119
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,470
You, what about you?

120
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,789
I... I also don't know.

121
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,880
If Ding Xian is really not around me anymore,

122
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,110
I think I will be so scared.

123
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,550
Let me do it.

124
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,110
No need for the courtesy with me.

125
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,200
I am leaving. Don't cry alone

126
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,790
in the basement.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,030
You should speak out

128
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,790
the things you need to say.

129
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,320
Got it.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
Xianxian, I miss you so much.

131
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Me too.

132
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,670
Maybe you guys should stay for two more days.

133
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
That's not okay.

134
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,230
If we stay for two more days, Song Ziqi will run away again.

135
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,470
And,

136
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,200
we should let him get back and apologize to his parents at least.

137
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,030
I don't think he'll dare to do it again.

138
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
Rest assured.

139
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,470
Then, you...

140
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,350
Zhou Siyue,

141
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,110
if anything happens to Xianxian,

142
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,520
I will come back and get you.

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,030
Don't worry.

144
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
She'll not get lost.

145
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,590
Glad to hear it.

146
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,760
You, come over.

147
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
What?

148
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,200
So, are we good now?

149
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,440
Are you dreaming?

150
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,110
How long have I been searching for you?

151
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,590
You need to make it up to me twice as much.

152
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,640
We are leaving now.

153
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,110
Be safe. Bye.

154
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't cry.

155
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,470
Hurry up.

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,790
Take care.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,000
Let me take you back to school.

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,080
No need. I can walk back to school myself.

159
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,470
I'd leave now.

160
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,470
If you are busy in school,

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,840
you don't need to come here so frequently.

162
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,790
Your mom and I are fine.

163
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,280
I can spare some time.

164
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,760
Right.

165
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Ding Xian is also in Hua Qing now.

166
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,710
I like this girl.

167
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,590
She has a spirit.

168
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,200
Extraordinary.

169
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm holding you up.

170
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,030
I didn't mean that.

171
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,670
It is just that I don't think it is the right time yet.

172
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,960
What do you mean, "not the right time"?

173
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,280
When is the right time then?

174
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,760
When I was young,

175
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,110
I needed to go to Jiangling to teach.

176
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,200
I wanted to take you and your mom with me.

177
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,030
But your mom,

178
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,200
since she was used to living a stable life,

179
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,030
she didn't want to move around with me.

180
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,000
I thought that as a family,

181
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,640
we shouldn't live separately in two different places.

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,590
But she was stubborn.

183
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,440
She wouldn't agree no matter what.

184
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,960
In the end, we dropped this matter.

185
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
Regarding this,

186
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,790
we have argued

187
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
for many times.

188
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,280
I used to think

189
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,670
that she wouldn't be able to carry on in Shenhai,

190
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,550
raising you all by herself.

191
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,590
She would come to me one day.

192
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,670
Only later did I find out

193
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,030
that I had underestimated her.

194
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,550
Not only did she bring you up,

195
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,670
but also raised you to be such an excellent man.

196
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,440
I don't know, for so many years,

197
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,760
how much she has been through

198
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,110
and how much she has suffered.

199
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Not until this accident

200
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,880
did it dawn on me

201
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,230
that your mom has always been

202
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
a capable woman.

203
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,000
In order to take care of me,

204
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,520
she put away the obsession for so many years

205
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,880
and came to Jiangling,

206
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,440
busy around without a single complaint.

207
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,520
Every time,

208
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,910
I see her sleep when she is exhausted,

209
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
I would think,

210
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,470
why did I have to come to Jiangling

211
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,440
to be a professor?

212
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,670
Why did I

213
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,080
have to keep her waiting for me?

214
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,710
Let's get inside.

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,280
There is a draft here.

216
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,000
You may catch a cold.

217
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,520
I believe,

218
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,640
wherever my son goes,

219
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,350
he will be successful.

220
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,670
But I don't want you

221
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,280
to find

222
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,470
that you are all alone

223
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,910
after you succeed.

224
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,840
Don't make your mom and me

225
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,670
an excuse of your own business.

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,470
We are great.

227
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,000
You don't need to worry about us.

228
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Alright.

229
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,000
Go back if you don't have other things.

230
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,840
Boss,

231
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
you finally admit.

232
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,230
I knew it! You have feelings for Ding Xian all along!

233
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
Fine.

234
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,589
Just tell me whether you will help me or not.

235
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,430
Of course.

236
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I am good at chasing girls.

237
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,560
Hello, guys.

238
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,710
We are Love Chasing League from now on.

239
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,560
Then I am Love.

240
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,950
I am Chasing.

241
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,800
You are League.

242
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,000
I'd be brain-damaged to ask you two for help.

243
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,760
Hurry.

244
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,190
Don't rush.

245
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,110
I have already learned

246
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,040
that members of the Anime Club are going to participate

247
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,520
in a Comic-con in Huai City.

248
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,190
And there is a great amusement park in Huai City.

249
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,190
Amusement park, great idea.

250
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,000
You see.

251
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,710
You can grab her hand when you're on the roller coaster.

252
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,520
Go to the haunted house.

253
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,040
When she gets scared in the haunted house, she'll hug you.

254
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,760
Last time I took Kong Shadi there,

255
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,230
she screamed and hugged me right away.

256
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,110
What are you talking about?

257
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,350
I am out now.

258
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,400
Boss.

259
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,590
Are you still chasing love now?

260
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,070
Yes.

261
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,710
Come in.

262
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,830
Mr. Su.

263
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,880
About the science expo of Robot Competition in Huai City,

264
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,190
its exhibits have already been prepared.

265
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,310
Please take a look.

266
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,950
Have you booked the ticket to Huai City?

267
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,800
Yes, nine o'clock tomorrow night.

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,830
Reschedule it to the morning.

269
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,070
Okay.

270
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,280
Thanks.

271
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,830
Get on quickly. Okay.

272
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
Sorry, Lou Feng.

273
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
Ji Hang happened to have other things to do.

274
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,160
So we asked for your help.

275
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,350
That's okay. I am free, anyway.

276
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,190
I just took it as a free trip.

277
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,400
Alright, then I should get on first.

278
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,110
Hurry.

279
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,800
Good morning, Lou Feng.

280
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,710
Do you know why the head of the Anime Club

281
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,920
doesn't come this time?

282
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Isn't it because he has other business to do?

283
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,310
Are you silly?

284
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,280
Can't you tell that he likes Xing Lufei?

285
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,190
I heard that Ji Hang

286
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,310
has a crush on her Xing Lufei for years.

287
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,710
But he can only watch her

288
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,880
falling in love with other people again and again.

289
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,310
And some time ago, he confessed his love to her.

290
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,160
Guess what?

291
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,430
What?

292
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,830
Xing said,

293
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,160
"I thought we were good friends."

294
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,640
Good morning.

295
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,830
Morning, Yuan Fang.

296
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,680
Good morning.

297
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,470
Xianxian.

298
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,280
Do you need my help?

299
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,000
No.

300
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,430
I want some.

301
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Here you go.

302
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,950
Xing Lufei is really something.

303
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,950
Doesn't she keep harassing your Zhou?

304
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,680
You need to be careful.

305
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,470
Speak of the devil.

306
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,800
Why are you here?

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,880
There are only five members in the robot team.

308
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,350
That's okay.

309
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,710
I have talked to Professor Ye.

310
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,470
I thought you wouldn't come today.

311
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,830
Zhou Siyue,

312
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
how do you know that I am going to Huai City?

313
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,590
No, it is not because of you.

314
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,950
Boss comes because of...

315
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,190
Xing Lufei

316
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,760
is really obsessed with Zhou.

317
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,070
Let's go.

318
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,830
Zhou Siyue, have an apple.

319
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,590
No, thanks. I am not hungry.

320
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,560
You are not hungry now, but you can still save it for tonight.

321
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,110
Here you are.

322
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,520
Xing

323
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,760
Have you heard of

324
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
an old saying?

325
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,920
What?

326
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,190
Apples should be eaten in the morning.

327
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,310
In the morning, the apple you eat is a golden one.

328
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,520
In the afternoon, it becomes a silver one.

329
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,350
At night,

330
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
it becomes a poisonous one.

331
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,880
That's too far-fetched.

332
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,830
That's real.

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
An old man in our village liked to eat apples at night.

334
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,710
Later...

335
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,800
What happened later?

336
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,800
Later,

337
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,310
he died.

338
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,310
Nonsense.

339
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,230
Fine.

340
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,000
Aren't you sleepy?

341
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,040
Take some sleep.

342
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,160
We are here.

343
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,760
I am so hungry now.

344
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,310
Let's go.

345
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,000
Instant noodles with an egg, bad luck comes to an end.

346
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
The weather is so nice today.

347
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,040
I want to have a spicy chicken burger.

348
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
Sure.

349
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,680
Xianxian.

350
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,110
Who is this? Why did he call you "Xianxian"?

351
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,000
He was a senior in my high school.

352
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,230
Su

353
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,310
Bocong, you are here so early?

354
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,830
The rooms for the Anime Club

355
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,110
have been arranged properly.

356
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,590
You can just bring in your luggage and check in.

357
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,000
Thanks.

358
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,000
Xianxian, Bocong is not only handsome and rich,

359
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,560
but also favors you.

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
You should not let the chance slip away.

361
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,350
I'd better get inside first.

362
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,040
- Are you tired? - I'm fine.

363
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
I can carry it myself.

364
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,560
Su

365
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
What are the odds?

366
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,110
Long time no see.

367
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,280
Your job covers quite a wide range now.

368
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
You need to receive the guests too?

369
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,110
I am here for Xianxian.

370
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,680
Right, the Robot Competition you join

371
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,560
is sponsored by Red Horse.

372
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,350
Red Horse seems to always be like this,

373
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
getting involved in everything.

374
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,950
But you need to have strength to get involved.

375
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,560
I am looking forward to your performance in the competition.

376
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,800
You don't need to worry about that.

377
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,400
Yuan Fang

378
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,230
Hurry up.

379
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,880
-Here. -Xianxian, have you eaten yet?

380
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,560
I know.

381
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,710
Not yet.

382
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,280
It is shameless to keep harassing others!

383
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,710
What are you talking about?

384
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,640
Sorry about that.

385
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,710
I arrived. I'll call you later.

386
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,000
Are you Mr. Su of Red Horse Tech?

387
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,310
You are?

388
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,040
You can give my luggage to me.

389
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,430
I am going inside now. I'll leave you guys to your business.

390
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,830
Let's go.

391
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,000
Hello.

392
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,830
Excuse me for a moment.

393
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,190
Xianxian.

394
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,230
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

395
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,560
It is probably not okay tonight.

396
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,000
I need to beat the deadline of the draft.

397
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,000
That's okay. I'll ask the hotel to bring you dinner.

398
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,400
By the way, my room number is 902.

399
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,520
You can find me whenever you want.

400
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,760
- Sure. - Go get some rest.

401
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,000
Bye bye.

402
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,560
Bye bye.

403
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,680
He even told you his room number,

404
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,110
and you said he is just a senior of your old school?

405
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,800
Yeah.

406
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,880
Mr. Su, hello.

407
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,680
Hello.

408
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,190
I heard that Red Horse Tech is sponsoring this competition.

409
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,520
And I have always looked forward to meeting you.

410
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,520
It never occurs to me that I can meet you here.

411
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,950
This is my name card.

412
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,880
I am sorry, but I have something to do now.

413
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Let's talk in details later.

414
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,230
Sure.

415
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,430
Zhou Siyue of Hua Qing Scientific Research Group?

416
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,310
It is me.

417
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,830
Hello, Professor Ye called me just now.

418
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,590
He asked me to discuss things about the competition with you.

419
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,110
Sure. No problem.

420
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,310
Can I have your phone number?

421
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,000
For contact. Is that okay?

422
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,800
Sure.

423
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,070
It seems that no matter where a handsome guy goes,

424
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,560
he can get special treatment.

425
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,680
Are you finished?

426
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,040
That's it.

427
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay. Thanks.

428
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,640
Please rest well.

429
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,880
- Bye. - Hello.

430
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,950
I am Yuan Fang.

431
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,470
What are you doing?

432
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Full.

433
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,000
Not yet.

434
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,760
Now it is full.

435
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,560
What plan do you have for tomorrow?

436
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
I'll take you to a place.

437
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,760
What are you trying to do?

438
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,470
I want to date you.

439
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
I am not available tomorrow.

440
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,310
Not available at any time.

441
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,590
Fine.

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,560
Then tell me where you are going tomorrow?

443
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,230
I'll go find you.

444
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,190
Can you stop pestering me?

445
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
You hate talking to me that much?

446
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,830
There is nothing for us to talk about now.

447
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,950
Zhou Siyue, don't be such a rascal.

448
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,400
Give me a chance to explain.

449
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,160
Actually, about what you said to Su Bocong that day,

450
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,190
I heard it all.

451
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,590
So, when I knew how hard and exhausting it was for you

452
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
as a Senior Three returnee in that year,

453
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,590
and it was all because of me,

454
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
I hesitated.

455
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,640
I thought that if I push you away,

456
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,590
you could find your own life.

457
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,310
I thought that what I did was for your good.

458
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,070
That was why I took the liberty to make all the decisions.

459
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,430
Actually, for these days,

460
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,920
I have always been questioning myself.

461
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,640
I was afraid of seeing you.

462
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,590
I was afraid that when you see me,

463
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,400
you will be disappointed at me.

464
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,560
Because I am no longer

465
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,190
the old Zhou Siyue.

466
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,110
Not the Zhou Siyue

467
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,520
who can lend you energy.

468
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,830
That was why I chose to run away from you.

469
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
But later,

470
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,920
when you came to Hua Qing,

471
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,830
and you showed up around me,

472
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,950
I couldn't help caring about you.

473
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,880
I just couldn't help picturing our future.

474
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,040
But this future

475
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,800
should never be a future that need you to sacrifice

476
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,520
what you like for my sake.

477
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,400
Actually I just want you to understand this.

478
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,560
And don't just ignore me like this.

479
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,470
Are you done?

480
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,590
Yes.

481
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,310
I have thought about

482
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,800
what you said.

483
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,640
You are afraid that uncle's thing will affect me.

484
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,710
That I can understand.

485
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,830
But I have never been afraid of that.

486
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,800
You said you wanted to go abroad, trying to push me away.

487
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,950
Then I would deal with

488
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,110
your worries about a long-distance relationship.

489
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
As for the opinions of the people in the university,

490
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,430
I won't care about them.

491
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,000
I chased after you so hard

492
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,280
for a simple reason.

493
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,000
That is, I like you.

494
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,560
But now I understand

495
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,590
that a true relationship is neck and neck.

496
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,000
But not that you come to tell me,

497
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,350
what to do at a time,

498
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,070
and what not to do at another time.

499
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,590
Zhou Siyue

500
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,950
Have you ever thought about

501
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,430
what really love is?

502
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,070
Zhou Siyue, there you are.

503
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,760
I happen to have something to ask you.

504
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,800
Ding Xian.

505
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,640
What are you guys doing here?

506
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,830
Wait a second.

507
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,710
Zhou Siyue,

508
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,920
you don't really like Ding Xian, do you?

509
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,230
I like her.

510
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,190
So what?

511
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,350
Boss.

512
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,000
That's not going to work.

513
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,800
Ding Xian just rejected you right away.

514
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,950
Then our plans are of no use.

515
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,040
Do you know how to contact Ding Xian's roommate?

516
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,920
Lou Feng.

517
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,760
So what's in it for me?

518
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,160
Aren't you in Professor Ye's Scientific Research Group?

519
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,470
There is a course taught by Professor Ye

520
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,230
that I can't sign up no matter what.

521
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,880
Don't go too far.

522
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,280
I am just an intern myself.

523
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,590
I will take care of it.

524
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,350
Zhou promised.

525
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,710
Your request will be fulfilled.

526
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
Feng, who were you calling just now?

527
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,470
An old classmate of mine.

528
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,760
Isn't the Comic-con the day after tomorrow?

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,160
Let's go have some fun tomorrow?

530
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,680
Okay.

531
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,400
Where should we go?

532
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,430
Just leave it to me.

533
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,800
Where are you, Lou Feng?

534
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,950
Alright, just hurry.

535
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,430
Good for you.

536
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
Bribed my roommate?

537
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,430
It seems

538
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,590
that everyone wants to help me.

539
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,310
The tickets are bought already.

540
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
You are really not going?

541
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,280
You have come so far away.

542
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,310
The tickets are quite expensive.

543
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,880
Fine.

544
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,920
But let me be clear.

545
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,520
It's just hanging around.

546
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,190
Don't you hold any other thoughts about me.

547
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,680
Whatever you say.

548
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
Let's see where we should have fun.

549
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,360
Boss, how is it?

550
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,630
Got inside. But we don't know where to go.

551
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,230
Take her to the haunted house.

552
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,670
Yes, take her there.

553
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,280
But I don't see one.

554
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,120
Hello, can I add your WeChat?

555
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,840
Sorry.

556
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,949
I already have a girlfriend.

557
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,560
Why do you walk so fast?

558
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,560
If you don't want to get around,

559
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,950
I can go myself.

560
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,600
How is it possible that I don't want to have fun?

561
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,360
Then tell me, what do you want to play?

562
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,870
What a huge maze!

563
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,360
We are in a Children's Park today, aren't we?

564
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,710
That's why there is not a haunted house.

565
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,150
What did you say?

566
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,470
What children's park?

567
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,230
It is for both adults and children.

568
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,760
Are you afraid of going into a maze?

569
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,910
How could I be afraid of that?

570
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,910
Then shall we compete?

571
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,910
See who gets out of the maze first.

572
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,950
If I get out first,

573
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,430
you'll promise me

574
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
not to ignore me from now on.

575
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay.

576
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,390
But if I get out first?

577
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,760
Then whatever you ask me to do, I'll do it.

578
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,000
Deal.

579
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,470
Deal.

580
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,910
Left, or right?

581
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,080
Why do you grin?

582
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,800
I feel that you are still the same as usual.

583
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,430
Didn't change at all.

584
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,560
I am warning you.

585
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Don't try to touch me.

586
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,280
I am going that way. Don't follow me.

587
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,230
I just came here, didn't I?

588
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,470
Zhou Siyue

589
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Ding Xian

590
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm here.

591
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,080
Don't be scared.

592
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,430
I am not.

593
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I am worried

594
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,080
that you can't find your way.

595
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,800
Go. Lead the way.

596
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,600
This way.

597
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,670
The air outside is great.

598
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,800
I won.

599
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,360
What?

600
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,520
I got out first.

601
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,470
Fine, but that was because I let you win.

602
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,390
You let me win?

603
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,040
I won.

604
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,120
What? You don't think it's fair?

605
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Kind of.

606
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Then, let's have another match.

607
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,520
Sure. Let's do it.

608
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
Thank you.

609
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,710
Here.

610
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,430
Thank you.

611
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,360
You are welcome.

612
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,630
What are you looking at?

613
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,390
When I was a child, my parents took me to an amusement park.

614
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,360
I also wanted a balloon.

615
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,390
But my mom didn't allow me to.

616
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,670
But she bought one for my brother.

617
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,000
Right.

618
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,120
I won in the maze game.

619
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,000
I haven't punished you yet.

620
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,670
What do you want me to do?

621
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,190
What?

622
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,280
Play a mascot for me.

623
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,280
I, Zhou Siyue,

624
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,430
play a mascot for you?

625
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,710
Are you kidding me?

626
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,150
Sorry.

627
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,520
Why did you apologize to me?

628
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,390
I wanted

629
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,470
to give you all.

630
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,670
But there is only one left.

631
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,600
Actually, one is enough.

632
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,000
What?

633
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,080
Nothing.

634
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,630
So?

635
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,800
Do you still have anything you want to play?

636
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,910
Were you caught in the rain?

637
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,600
No.

638
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,630
Wait for me here.

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,280
A cup of hot coco, and paper tissue, please.

640
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,670
No, thanks.

641
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,280
Thank you.

642
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,000
Your back is all wet.

643
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,800
I'll do it myself.

644
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,800
Stay still.

645
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,230
Why are your ears so red?

646
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,430
So hot.

647
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,470
Your hands are so cold.

648
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,190
It seems to be the second time that we get caught in a rain.

649
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,710
Do you still remember

650
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,430
when we got caught in the rain the first time?

651
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,840
I do.

652
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
When we were sophomores

653
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,630
We went to watch the movie 2012.

654
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,800
And we almost bumped into Mr. Liu.

655
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,320
Then...

656
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,280
The end-of-the-world fireworks

657
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,120
was set by you?

658
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,000
Thank you.

659
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,870
The end-of-the-world fireworks

660
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,520
gave me a reason to apply for Hua Qing University again.
