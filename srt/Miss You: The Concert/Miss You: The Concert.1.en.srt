Awesome!

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,840
Here.

8
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
Are you having fun?

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,420
- Yes! - Yes!

10
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,500
Give your loudest applause

11
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,960
to the person you love most.

12
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
Who is she?

13
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,200
- Zhao Lusi! - Zhao Lusi!

14
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
Welcome, everyone,

15
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,240
all the passionate friends here tonight,

16
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
and all our Canelés.

17
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,960
Welcome to

"Miss You: The Zhao Lusi Concert".

19
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm your host, Yang Yang.

20
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
It's such a pleasure and an honor

21
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,160
to be here with so many of you

22
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,020
to witness Lusi's big night.

23
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,480
Lusi, come on.

24
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's say hi to everyone first, okay?

25
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,920
This side first.

26
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
Did you miss me?

27
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,960
- Yes! - Yes!

28
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Are you happy to be in Chengdu?

29
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
- Yes! - Yes!

30
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
Have you been doing well lately?

31
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
- Yes! - Yes!

32
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
And do you love me?

33
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,860
- We do! - We do!

34
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,360
Hello, my friends.

35
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm Lusi.

36
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,480
Welcome to the "Miss You"

37
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
concert tonight,

38
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
and let's share

39
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,600
all the joy and happiness of this evening.

40
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
I'm really, really happy

41
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,040
to see you all here today

42
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,240
and to finally meet you in person.

43
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,400
I've missed you so much!

44
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah.

45
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,040
During rehearsals,

46
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,720
I actually cried quite a few times.

47
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
So I told myself tonight

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,920
I have to give my best to every song.

49
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,440
Because I want

50
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,200
your trip to Chengdu to be totally worth it.

51
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,480
I hope tonight becomes

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
a day you'll always remember.

53
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,460
Is that okay?

54
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,080
- Okay! - Okay!

55
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's tell Lusi with a round of applause

56
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,080
what you thought of that brand-new opening song.

57
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,940
Wasn't it amazing?

58
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,760
- Amazing! - Amazing!

59
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,060
Really?

60
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,320
- Really! - Really!

61
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,600
- I've noticed people in Chengdu. - Thank you.

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
You get into the mood right away.

63
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,320
You hardly need any warm-up,

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,920
You're already super hyped.

65
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,680
Yeah, a lot of my fans

66
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
are usually "I" types, introverts.

67
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
But once they see me,

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
they flip to "E", full extrovert.

69
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,360
And I can feel that tonight,

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,680
because Lusi is here,

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,240
our whole venue

72
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
is filled with sweetness,

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,080
and so is the whole city of Chengdu.

74
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,080
- Right! - I want to wave mine too.

75
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
And Lusi, you know what?

76
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
When they wave those light sticks,

77
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
it's not just happiness,

78
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
there's a bit of pride in there too.

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,320
Really?

80
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,080
They all won their tickets by acing a quiz.

81
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,400
I almost didn't make it,

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
because I flunked mine.

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
They're amazing.

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Give yourselves a round of applause, okay?

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,160
Everyone

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
who made it here today.

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
You're incredible!

88
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm so happy to see you.

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,640
I used to think

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,680
you were the ones who needed me.

91
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,280
But after all this time,

92
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,760
after almost a whole year

93
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,440
truly taking a break,

94
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,120
I've realized I'm the one who really needs you.

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
So thank you for being here.

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Thank you!

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Thank you, everyone.

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,200
We're just so happy.

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Lusi might have a tough night tonight,

100
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
because the stage is in the round.

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,240
She needs to say hi to everyone

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,720
and really "miss you" face to face.

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,440
That's right.

104
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
Plus this time, the director and team

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,640
designed a stage

106
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,360
that's super close to all of you.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Right?

108
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,600
We can even walk toward you.

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,160
I can get really close to you!

110
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
And there's even a zipline that'll fly me right up!

111
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
Kidding.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,080
Friends in the back, if I were you,

113
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,240
I couldn't hold back my cheers and screams.

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm coming over!

115
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,080
Here I come!

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Take your time.

117
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,440
Lusi, take care.

118
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
It's okay. Even if I trip tonight,

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,640
it shouldn't be anything serious.

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
We can get even closer!

121
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,040
Welcome, everyone.

122
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,080
Okay, let's head back to center stage, Lusi.

123
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,800
Okay.

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,280
Because we're about to start

125
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,760
our next carefully prepared performance.

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,920
What kind of vibe will it be?

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,960
What kind of performance will it be?

128
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
For our second performance,

129
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,600
it's going to be

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,960
very "Chengdu" in spirit.

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,880
A pity I'm on my own tonight.

132
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,120
Because this song is called "All Is Love".

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
"If you don't love me..."

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,480
- "Then give me back my heart!" - "Then give me back my heart!"

135
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,440
"If your love cost me my youth..."

136
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,240
- "What's left for me?" - "What's left for me?"

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
So good!

138
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,120
You can feel the whole place full of love.

139
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Before we officially start this segment,

140
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
let's thank

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,040
all our amazing partners for tonight.

142
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Thanks to our title sponsor, ROSYDOEDIAN!

143
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,360
Thanks to our co-sponsor, Aaaaapple!

144
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,260
Thanks to our special sponsor, PECHOIN!

145
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,360
Thanks to our industry sponsor, moonmoi!

146
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,760
And to PELLIOT

147
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
for their strong support!

148
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
And now,

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
all friends full of love,

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
all Chengdu locals here,

151
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
are you ready?

152
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,540
- Ready! - Ready!

153
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,680
Then let's give a big round of applause

154
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,480
to welcome... Zhao Lusi!

155
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,740
["All Is Love" lyrics & music: Zhang Chao]

156
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,760
Applause and screams for Zhao Lusi!

157
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,280
Amazing!

158
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,720
That's right.

159
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
Lusi's off now to get ready

160
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,760
for her next look onstage.

161
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You are really in for a treat tonight,

162
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,800
because there's more than one look.

163
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
Lots of surprises

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
are coming to this stage one by one.

165
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,760
And in this part,

166
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
I can't do it on my own.

167
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,040
I need everyone here in Chengdu

168
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,640
to help me show Lusi

169
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
just how "All Is Love" you are, okay?

170
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,880
- Okay! - Okay!

171
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,120
Let's play a little game.

172
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,480
First let me hear

173
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
the applause from our Chengdu friends here.

174
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,480
[Lusi]

175
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,840
Now friends from out of town, let's hear you.

176
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
Okay, level up.

177
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,240
We were going to play

178
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
a little Chengdu-dialect rap game.

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Now I'm not sure if our out-of-town friends

180
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
can pull off the part

181
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
Lusi just did

182
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
with that Chengdu rap.

183
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
Can you do it?

184
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,480
- We can! - We can!

185
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
All right, are you ready?

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Friends upstairs, you cheer too,

187
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,480
okay?

188
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,720

in the story,

353
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,280
but it's also

354
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,800
like a gift from Xu Yan to Lusi.

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,120
In this very important year, 2025,

356
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,200
she hands that gift to Lusi,

357
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,040
telling her not to live as someone else's shadow,

358
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,560
but to be the self who shines.

359
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,840
In that moment,

360
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,320
the boat is herself,

361
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,720
the lighthouse is herself,

362
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
and the shore is also...

363
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,220
- Herself! - Herself!

364
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,240
I believe Lusi has already done that.

365
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,560
And what makes her even happier

366
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,160
is that when she reaches the shore,

367
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,360
she finds so many people there

368
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
standing with her, right?

369
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
- Right! - Right!

370
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,960
It's really incredible!

371
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,040
And hearing those lyrics

372
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,600
come from Lusi herself

373
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,640
makes them feel especially real

374
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,240
and especially powerful.

375
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,080
I believe this version

376
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,800
is one you'll all treasure.

377
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Now's the perfect time

378
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
to have some fun with you all.

379
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
We just played

380
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,520
a little Chengdu-dialect rap.

381
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,440
Next,

382
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm sure you can all sing pretty well too.

383
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,480
How about we raise the difficulty a bit?

384
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,300
Can we?

385
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,360
- Yes! - Yes!

386
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,760
Let's go all in, then.

387
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,640
Let me ask: Lusi's opening song,

388
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,200
"Black Veil Bride",

389
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,400
can anyone sing it?

390
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
- We can! - We can!

391
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
Friends up on the third floor, can you?

392
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,180
- We can! - We can!

393
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,840
Amazing.

394
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
All right, here's the plan.

395
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
We'll invite friends from this side

396
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,000
to take on the chorus

397
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,600
of Lusi's English single.

398
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,680
And let's have the music, please.

399
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,120
Three, two, one, go.

400
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Sing it loud!

401
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,400
Give them a round of applause!

402
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,280
That was great!

403
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,840
Really amazing!

404
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,160
Now for this next part,

405
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,000
we're handing the stage to all of you.

406
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,960
Just now, we heard your voices in song.

407
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
But have you ever imagined

408
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,720
sharing the screen with Lusi one day?

409
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,720
Do you want that?

410
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,840
We do!

411
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
Tonight in Chengdu, we're making that happen for you!

412
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,080
It's really simple.

413
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
In a moment,

414
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,960
we'll play a series of clips

415
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,880
of Lusi's classic hand dances.

416
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,600
Some you know by heart,

417
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
and some the whole world knows.

418
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,240
All by Lusi.

419
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,520
So follow along with the screen and learn the moves.

420
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,160
Once you've learned them,

421
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,480
our director will use this camera

422
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,200
to capture shots of all of you.

423
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,120
If you're lucky enough to be picked,

424
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,880
You'll show up on the big screen with Lusi.

425
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,440
And don't forget to use your phone

426
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
to record

427
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
this unforgettable moment

428
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400
here tonight in Chengdu,

429
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,440
at the "Miss You" concert,

430
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,880

431
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
together with everyone.

432

We're ready!

434
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,800
All right, Director,

435
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
please put it up on the big screen.

436
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,480
Let's learn some hand dances together.

440

You sang so well!

444
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,160
I still haven't had enough.

445
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,480
And she's off to change again.

446
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,120
You're really getting spoiled tonight.

447
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,880
That song just now, "You Are My Light",

448
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm sure you all loved singing it.

449
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
Lusi also asked me

450
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,920
to hand this next moment over to you.

451
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Usually, it's you recording,

452
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,360
capturing so many

453
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,600
of Lusi's moments onstage.

454
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,880
But this time,

455
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,440
Lusi wants to record

456
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,320
your voices and your faces.

457
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,720
That's right.

458
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,640
So now, everyone,

459
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,480
turn on your phone flashlights

460
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,160

461
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,040

onto you,

464
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,960
and let's enjoy this moment together

465
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,040

466
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,320

- Okay! - Okay!

468

If you sing loud enough,

469
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,160

00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,380
Lusi?

560
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,540
I've got nothing more to say.

561
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,220
Number one!

562
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,400
It's truly the number-one show.

563
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,640
So let's do it.

564
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,820
Okay.

565
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,460
Okay.

566
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,040
I'm so excited.

567
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,530
Give it up with a big round of applause!

568
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,420
"Xu Yan March" is coming up.

569
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,120
ROSYDOEDIAN...search "ROSYDOEDIAN" on Tmall.

570
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,560
Is "Xu Yan" beautiful?

571
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,360
- Beautiful! - Beautiful!

572
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,640
Is Lusi amazing?

573
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,960
- She is! - She is!

574
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,920
Are you satisfied?

575
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,000
This whole segment is for you.

576
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,840
Because now, the videos I record myself,

577
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,960
whether on Tiktok

578
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,560
or anywhere else,

579
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,360
are actually much fewer than before.

580
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,940
I really feel quite sorry about that.

581
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,920
But honestly,

582
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,640
most of the time,

583
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,100
it's really hard for me now

584
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,840
to have those truly happy moments.

585
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,460
Right now though, I really am so happy.

586
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,160
Yeah.

587
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,200
But usually,

588
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,900
I'm actually pretty low.

589
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,740
So in my day-to-day life,

590
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,380
when I'm not seeing you,

591
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,460
it's hard to feel like recording anything.

592
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,120
So in that sense,

593
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,520
I really do feel I owe my fans a lot.

594
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,480
So today,

595
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,320
this whole spin-the-wheel game

596
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,940
is really to give you more material,

597
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,540
so you can film enough Tiktok videos in one go

598
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,940
and help me post them, okay?

599
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,680
- Okay! - Okay!

600
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,840
But we also have to meet more often,

601
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,600
because every time we meet,

602
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,220
Lusi's just as happy as she is today.

603
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:19,640
Yeah.

604
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,680
Up until yesterday,

605
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,420
I probably still wasn't this relaxed,

606
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,400
because I missed you all so much.

607
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,760
And then today,

608
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,380
only when I stood here

609
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,380
and saw every one of you

610
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,800
did I really start

611
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,400
to fall in love with this stage,

612
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,300
and really start to let go and have fun.

613
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,760
So I'm really grateful to you.

614
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,680
Same old line:

615
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,940
Your love is incredible!

616
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,100
Lusi's love is also...

617
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,100
- Incredible! - Incredible!

618
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,560
You're truly amazing!

619
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,280
I'm really happy,

620
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,400
because here today,

621
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,760
we also have many influencer friends.

622
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,280
Really a lot.

623
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,900
Yeah. I'm so grateful to them.

624
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,000
Because whether it's "Love's Ambition"

625
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,660
or all the event promos,

626
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,500
they've helped me so, so much.

627
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,900
So, I hope you'll keep creating.

628
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,480
And thank you!

629
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,120
Thank you for liking me!

630
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,800
Thank you!

631
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,820
I hope all of you

632
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,660
can pass this love on.

633
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
And thanks to all the bloggers here,

634
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,120
and to the audience for supporting Lusi.

635
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,080
So let's keep spinning the wheel.

636
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,680
Let's go on.

637
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,380
Let's keep the prizes coming.

638
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,120
The director told me today

639
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,240
we have to go through every option.

640
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,840
Really?

641
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,560
Maybe we just do everything on the wheel.

642
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,200
Since we're here till three a.m., right?

643
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,360
Right.

644
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,360
So keep spinning.

645
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,580
Let's see what the second one is.

646
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,140
It landed exactly in order, right?

647
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,300
Zone 1, then Zone 2.

648
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,580
It did.

649
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,840
Read classic lines from "Hidden Love"

650
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,680
and "Love's Ambition" in Chengdu dialect.

651
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,480
The lines are on the cards, right?

652
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,560
One from "Hidden Love",

653
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,500
and one from "Love's Ambition".

654
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:00,780
Okay.

655
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,600
"Xu Yan, pick up the phone!"

656
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,800
Are you sure?

657
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,440
It's "Yan, pick up the phone."

658
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,120
"Yan, pick up the phone"...

659
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,840
Let's start with the "Hidden Love" one.

660
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,860
"I once secretly hid..."

661
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,000
No, William Chan will get sensitive.

662
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,920
In Chengdu dialect.

663
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,580
All right, here we go.

664
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,400
"I once secretly hid

665
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,760
all my feelings for him,

666
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,120
too scared to let anyone find out.

667
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,720
I worked hard to become better

668
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,600
so I could catch up to him.

669
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,120
When I finally got to his side,

670
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,880
I realized

671
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,680
I'd never been running alone.

672
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,380
He'd been running toward me too!"

673
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,840
Feels like I'm saying this

674
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,280
to a delivery guy.

675
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Like, "Just leave it at the door!"

676
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah, sounds like it's to the delivery guy.

677
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,800
"I'd never been running alone.

678
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,560
He'd been running toward me too!"

679
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,560
So "going both ways" turns out

680
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,640
to be the delivery guy's story.

681
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
And the last line is

682
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,560
"I have a secret:

683
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,160
I really, really like someone."

684
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,440
It does sound a bit creepy.

685
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,280
I don't even know why.

686
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,280
It totally fits

687
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,920
that sneaky, hidden-crush vibe.

688
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,880
It's so sneaky.

689
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,840
Maybe you should

690
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,000
re-dub "Hidden Love" completely in Sichuan dialect.

691
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,760
Just shoot a whole new version.

692
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,800
Okay, now let's see

693
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,800
what "Love's Ambition" is like

694
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,100
in Chengdu dialect.

695
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,420
Okay.

696
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,720
Give Yan a cheer, okay?

697
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,840
What are you shouting?

698
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,200
- "Yan, pick up the phone!" - "Yan, pick up the phone!"

699
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,880
Turn it into your ringtone later, okay?

700
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,880
- Okay! - Okay!

701
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,560
"Yan, pick up the phone!"

702
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,320
Okay, the next goes

703
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,240
"My worth

704
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,040
doesn't need any relationship to define it.

705
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,820
Wherever I stand,

706
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,020
that's where the light is.

707
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,600
I can love you with all my heart,

708
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,000
but only if I don't lose myself.

709
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,880
If you want to turn things around,

710
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,000
don't pin your hopes on anyone else.

711
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,080
It's just trading what you have for what you want."

712
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,180
That hits just right, doesn't it?

713
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,160
So on point.

714
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,240
Honestly,

715
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,440
I think Xu Yan is really like a Sichuan girl.

716
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,080
Totally. She's very sharp,

717
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,400
very free and easy.

718
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,160
Right?

719
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,160
So these two Chengdu-dialect versions

720
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,080
mark our second treat of the night

721
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,580
Save them all.

722
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,040
And you can @ Lusi with them

723
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,600
later online.

724
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:26,840
Okay.

725
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,880
Now let's spin the third one

726
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,840
and see where it lands.

727
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,780
[Record "good morning, good afternoon, good night" voice messages for fans]

728
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,440
We just got a ringtone,

729
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,100
and now we'll get voice greetings too.

730
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,140
Okay.

731
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,240
Morning, afternoon, and night,

732
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,280
we need all three.

733
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,860
Okay.

734
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,620
"Good morning, time to get up.

735
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,820
Let's welcome a beautiful new day."

736
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,200
"Good afternoon.

737
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,840
You've been busy all morning,

738
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,600
so you must be tired.

739
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,140
Have a good nap."

740
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,040
"Good afternoon again.

741
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,240
You're probably feeling

742
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,760
a little worn out right now.

743
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,600
But the day's almost over,

744
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,340
Hang in there!"

745
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,040
You even added an extra one.

746
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,720
Don't forget the night one.

747
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,480
"Good night,

748
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,360
my cutest Canelés.

749
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,680
Thank you for your love.

750
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,320
Let's all sleep well tonight."

751
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,080
With these four greetings,

752
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,560
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful day

753
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,480
with Lusi there with you.

754
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,220
Let's keep spinning the wheel!

755
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,880
I really want to see some dancing.

756
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,360
Dancing...

757
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,360
Dancing...

758
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,900
[Say a cheesy love line to everyone]

759
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,880
Cheesy pick-up line time!

760
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,520
I've had this one ready for ages,

761
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,720
to be honest with you.

762
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,800
You've been saving that?

763
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,020
I've had this one in the bag.

764
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,400
"There are three kinds of rulers in this world.

765
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,380
One is a straight ruler,

766
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,680
one is a triangle ruler,

767
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,480
and the third is...

768
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,820
I love you so much!"

769
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,520
It's pretty cheesy, right?

770
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,360
You can tell

771
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,160
Lusi hasn't been really surfing online lately.

772
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,180
This meme's a bit old-school.

773
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:35,560
Yeah.

774
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,040
Just kidding.

775
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,680
Yeah.

776
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,480
But you all felt the love behind it.

777
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,280
Now, let's keep spinning.

778
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,620
Spin again?

779
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,320
Let's do one more.

780
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,440
Let's try to land

781
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,280
on the dance option, okay?

782
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,920
If we can't, I'll just dance anyway.

783
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,040
I think it'll land on Zone 9.

784
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,640
Let's stop it together.

785
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,200
["Who's My Groom" dance]
What a coincidence! That's it!

786
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:53,760
It really did!

787
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,580
Oh my gosh!

788
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,220
What a coincidence!

789
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,480
We totally rigged it, too obvious.

790
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,400
Okay, let's dance "Who's My Groom".

791
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,840
Which side should I face?

792
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,520
This side?

793
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:04,880
Which side?

794
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,160
Or this side?

795
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,220
Okay.

796
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,400
Then let's start with this side.

797
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,440
This side first, okay?

798
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,860
Okay.

799
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,140
Clockwise.

800
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,900
You'll go in this order.

801
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,900
All right, cue the music.

802
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,940
Three, two, one, go.

803
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,120
So, who is Lusi's groom?

804
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,740
- Me! - Me!

805
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,520
Let's do two final spins, okay?

806
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,580
Okay.

807
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,100
One for this side and one for that side.

808
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:10,660
Okay.

809
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,640
Let's see what prizes they'll get.

810
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,040
Okay, keep going, yeah.

811
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,160
Wow, the wheel moves all by itself.

812
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:17,920
So cool.

813
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,260
This wheel...

814
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,920
[Name ten good things about the Canelés]

815
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,480
Let's start on this side.

816
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,940
Name ten good things about my Canelés.

817
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,920
Give this side seven first.

818
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,440
Honestly, ten good things about you

819
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,520
wouldn't even scratch the surface.

820
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,160
First, I think you're really talented.

821
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,600
Talented,

822
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,560
You're full of creativity.

823
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,400
Among my Canelés,

824
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,600
there are people in all kinds of jobs,

825
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,400
and so many students too.

826
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,400
I feel like each of you

827
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,320
is incredibly gifted,

828
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,960
and has real depth.

829
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm full of admiration

830
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,960
for you.

831
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,920
That's the first one.

832
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,480
Second,

833
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,160
I think you're really funny.

834
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,440
You edit so many great clips,

835
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,160
you come up with so many fun ideas,

836
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,240
and you always make me feel like

837
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,040
whenever I see your comments

838
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,240
or the things you post,

839
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,920
I just crack up.

840
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,560
You make me

841
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,280
go "pfft" and burst out laughing.

842
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,400
Third,

843
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,880
my Canelés are all beautiful, right?

844
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,100
Right!

845
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,180
My fans all look amazing,

846
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,160
absolutely gorgeous!

847
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,920
Now the fourth one.

848
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,000
Fourth, I think my Canelés

849
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,160
are really good observers.

850
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,440
Because

851
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,520
in every role I play,

852
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,800
and in every line I say,

853
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,680
you can catch all the tiny shifts and details.

854
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,880
Even if I've lost a bit of weight,

855
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,120
or my double-eyelid tape is crooked,

856
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,400
or I'm missing a single eyelash...

857
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,720
you still notice all of it.

858
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,260
You're great at noticing life,

859
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,660
and great at noticing me.

860
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,800
Number five.

861
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
I think my Canelés

862
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,600
are all really free-spirited!

863
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,320
You came all the way to Chengdu

864
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,600
and turned it into a spur-of-the-moment trip!

865
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,040
That makes you truly brave in my eyes.

866
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,180
Which number are we on now?

867
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,060
Number six.

868
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,400
Number six.

869
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,440
I think my Canelés

870
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,800
are incredibly loyal.

871
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,040
So many of you

872
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,960
have been with me for so long.

873
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,040
Any eight-year Canelés here?

874
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,760
Wave your hands!

875
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,720
A lot of you

876
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,560
have known me since my very first drama.

877
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,800
So it's been eight years now.

878
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,280
I often see the edits you make

879
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,240
of my whole journey so far.

880
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,960
And I often feel

881
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,520
this journey with me hasn't been easy.

882
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,960
And another thing is,

883
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,640
my Canelés are very good

884
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,080
at making me cry.

885
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,600
Your love always makes me

886
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,240
get so emotional,

887
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,480
because it's so real.

888
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,640
Sincerity has so much power.

889
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah.

890
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,520
The last two good points.

891
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,600
One more is that you're incredibly brave.

892
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,880
Amid all the gossip

893
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,560
and all those different voices,

894
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,280
you stay this firm

895
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,960
and believe in me this much.

896
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,960
It makes me feel

897
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,000
like...

898
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,000
it's not a cliff behind me.

899
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,400
It's all of you, holding me.

900
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,960
And the tenth thing is,

901
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,000
my Canelés

902
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,400
love me so, so much.

903
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:19,860
Yeah.

904
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,600
You've made me rely on that love,

905
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,080
slowly get used to it,

906
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,260
and want to give even more love back to you.

907
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,400
So thank you.

908
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,200
Return love with love.

909
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,240
You can really feel

910
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,800
the love overflowing

911
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,600
between Lusi and her Canelés.

912
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,560
I hope you'll carry

913
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,080
these ten good things forward,

914
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
and create even more

915
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,760
beautiful, love-filled moments with Lusi.

916
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,880
Let's spin the wheel one last time.

917
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,480
The final one.

918
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,060
What do you all want to see?

919
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:55,840
Which one do you want?

920
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,600
Which one?

921
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,720
The hand dance?

922
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,680
Instant photos?

923
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,760
Which do you want?

924
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,260
Photos...

925
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,080
Magic!

926
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,520
How magical is this!

927
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,400
What hand sign should we all do together?

928
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,060
Let's do a special one, okay?

929
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,360
Okay.

930
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,920
A heart?

931
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:24,900
Okay.

932
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,880
All right, hearts it is.

933
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,000
Everyone, make a heart.

934
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,500
Three, two, one.

935
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,600
It's coming out.

936
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,520
Okay, Lusi,

937
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,600
wait for it to develop.

938
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,920
Now this side.

939
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,060
All right, friends on this side, get ready.

940
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,720
And friends on the third floor too.

941
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,480
Even her backs look great.

942
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,120
Do you want back view or front view?

943
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,320
Back view works too.

944
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,060
Three, two, one.

945
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,880
Got it.

946
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,040
Lusi, hold this one too.

947
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,920
In a bit, we'll watch them develop together.

948
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,000
All right, friends on this side.

949
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,100
Three, two, one.

950
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,720
Okay, ready.

951
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,720
Three, two, one.

952
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,140
All right.

953
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,260
Let's keep all these beautiful moments.

954
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,320
All right, let's head back to center stage

955
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,160
and show them to the camera.

956
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,540
The earlier ones are already slowly developing.

957
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,080
Each side has its own charm.

958
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,080
Some are super close-ups of Lusi,

959
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,200
and some are those gorgeous back views.

960
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,200
I'm keeping them, okay?

961
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,160
May I have them?

962
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,400
Keep them carefully.

963
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,400
Want to hear another song?

964
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,520
- Yes! - Yes!

965
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,360
Now we'll hand the stage

966
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,440
back to our Lusi!

967
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,080
Please.

968
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,080
["River of Love" lyrics: Ma Yi, music: Cheng Jinyuan]

969
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,160
Here's "River of Love" for you all.

970
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,200
Let's sing it together, okay?

971
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,040
So beautiful, right?

972
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,920
Yes!

973
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,040
Really?

974
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,720
Lusi, why did you pick this song?

975
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,840
Share with us.

976
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,760
Because...

977
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,000
because this year,

978
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,760
it's almost ten years

979
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,240
since I debuted.

980
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,560
And...

981
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,760
there's this feeling that's been slowly growing

982
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,880
through my acting journey

983
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,120
and all the time I've spent

984
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
with my fans.

985
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,020
Over time,

986
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,080
I've come to feel

987
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
it surges up sometimes,

988
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,960
and sometimes

989
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,040
it's very calm.

990
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,160
I feel like it's a little river

991
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,440
flowing in the space between us.

992
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,680
And I think

993
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,160
that little river must be made of love.

994
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,600
That's why I chose "River of Love"

995
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,240
to share with everyone.

996
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,320
I think it suits them.

997
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:24,920
That's so romantic.

998
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,800
Just now, carried by Lusi's voice,

999
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,140
the music took us

1000
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,520
right into a river of love.

1001
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,320
I hope we'll have more time

1002
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,280
and more

1003
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,160
of those tiny moments

1004
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,460
where we can pour our hearts out

1005
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,660
and share them with each other.

1006
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,680
Next up,

1007
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,280
we have a little ceremony.

1008
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,400
Our fans who love Lusi

1009
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,080
have specially recorded

1010
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,920
a message they want to say to her.

1011
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,480
Really?

1012
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,680
Everyone here will hear it...

1013
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,000
But during rehearsal...

1014
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,880
Lusi didn't get to hear this.

1015
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,040
So let's all listen to it

1016
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,320
together with her.

1017
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,280
- Let's hear what's in their hearts, - Okay.

1018
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,000
what they want to say to Lusi.

1019
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,320
[On Nov. 9, a tiny speck of dust appeared in this world.]

1020
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,180
[But to Canelés, it was a star falling to earth.]

1021
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,420
"This is my seventh year liking you."

1022
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,940
"Without noticing, I've been with you for 2,000 days."

1023
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,620
"Without noticing, I've been fond of you for three years."

1024
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,180
"Today is day 261 of me liking you."

1025
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,460
"From September 18, 2022 till now,

1026
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,540
I've liked you for 1,122 days."

1027
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,500
"Time really flies.

1028
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,740
Canelés have known you for eight years now."

1029
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,420
"All these years, we've watched you grow through each role.

1030
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,740
Your hard work and love for acting are crystal clear."

1031
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,940
"You're truly amazing. I love watching you act.

1032
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,820
You said you'll act till you're eighty, so I'll watch you till then."

1033
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,820
"Thanks for accompanying us with your roles and your smile.

1034
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,900
Remember, your health comes first. Eat properly."

1035
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,540
"I hope every day goes your way and brings you joy."

1036
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,340
"May you feel ever more complete in loving and being loved."

1037
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,660
"Thank you for always caring for us and loving us."

1038
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,580
"Thank you for each drama and every kind gesture

1039
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,180
that brings us new surprises and little bits of courage.

1040
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,380
I'm also working hard to become a better me."

1041
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,020
"I hope you always keep the courage to love and be loved."

1042
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,620
"Get past each hurdle, and the road ahead will still shine.

1043
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,260
We'll all be right behind you, always."

1044
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:19,780
"Because of you, I've become more confident, braver, and stronger."

1045
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,660
"You are brave, kind, honest, and beautiful.

1046
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:25,020
May you always be your own sunflower."

1047
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,300
"On this brilliant day that belongs to you,

1048
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:32,140
may every flower bloom for you and every star shine for you."

1049
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,940
"I miss you so much, even if we can't meet today.

1050
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:39,660
We'll still have so many moments together. I love you most!"

1051
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,140
"To me, you're like a gift.

1052
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,220
Thank you for coming into my life."

1053
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,340
"Do everything that makes your eyes light up.

1054
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,700
Don't worry about the outcome.

1055
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,780
We'll walk every long, tough road with you."

1056
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,000
"It won't stop this year. Every year to come, we'll be with you.

1057
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,620
I love you!"

1058
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:57,100
"All of us will be keeping an eye on you, okay?"

1059
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,660
"Lotus blooms and falls.

1060
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,580
With a heart as kind as yours,

1061
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,340
blooming or fading are just different ways of being whole."

1062
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,580
"I've remembered your word for years:

1063
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,060
'Cherish the moment, and let's grow up together.'"

1064
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,620
"Thank you for choosing to be an actor.

1065
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,020
Now your light rises and outshines all.

1066
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,060
It'll be your era!"

1067
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,580
"May you always keep this precious heart.

1068
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,940
May joy and good fortune always walk with you."

1069
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,540
"I'm a Canelé from Guangxi."

1070
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,460
"I'm a Canelé from Singapore."

1071
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,820
"I'm a Canelé from Shandong."

1072
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,900
"I'm a Canelé from Suzhou, Jiangsu."

1073
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,180
"You're like a beam of light in my darkest world."

1074
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,900
"Keep charging forward!"

1075
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,060
"Take on the dramas you want..."

1076
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,940
"We'll all be here backing you!"

1077
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:42,500
"Keep warm and don't get sick."

1078
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,660
"You know what? You're truly amazing!"

1079
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,840
"We're always there."

1080
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,940
"You're our one and only, forever."

1081
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,700
"At 27, shine in your own light."

1082
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,720
In moments like this,

1083
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,840
you're trying to make up my mess, huh?

1084
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,040
Mess up my makeup.

1085
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,320
Oh...

1086
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,280
You could barely speak correctly.

1087
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,320
No...

1088
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,320
All right...

1089
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,900
Maybe what you all feel out there

1090
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,260
is a little bit different from ours.

1091
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,120
Because Lusi and I

1092
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,760
were standing right in the middle of this stage.

1093
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,200
The whole venue went dark,

1094
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,960
and all your glow sticks were shining.

1095
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,600
We couldn't see the screen from here,

1096
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,440
but every word reached our ears.

1097
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,920
It felt like we were at the center of the universe,

1098
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,120
with countless bits of love

1099
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,460
shooting in from different stars

1100
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,740
and swirling around our ears.

1101
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:44,280
I wonder

1102
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,180
what Lusi is feeling right now.

1103
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,440
Why don't you share it with everyone?

1104
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:52,860
No crying.

1105
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:53,400
Let's not cry.

1106
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,120
Maybe everything this year

1107
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,920
hits a bit harder.

1108
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,320
Because...

1109
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,360
because I feel like...

1110
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,760
Well, if I want to cry, I just have to cry,

1111
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,240
since I don't want

1112
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,640
to bottle up any of my feelings anymore.

1113
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,720
Because...

1114
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,760
since I was little, I've never been the type

1115
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,040
to express

1116
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,440
feelings like that.

1117
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,200
My close friends always say,

1118
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,620
"Zhao Lusi, your tongue is so sharp."

1119
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,120
Because...

1120
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,540
I really don't say sweet things

1121
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:32,680
very often.

1122
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,400
So today, I'm trying to change that.

1123
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,240
I mean,

1124
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,480
if words can carry love,

1125
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,680
I want all of you to feel

1126
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,400
some of what's in my heart.

1127
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,400
And then,

1128
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,840
actually,

1129
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,440
back when...

1130
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,040
Eight years ago,

1131
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,800
when I entered this industry

1132
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,000
at seventeen,

1133
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,120
I honestly didn't know what being an actor meant.

1134
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,440
I kind of thought,

1135
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,480
like...

1136
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,880
Back then I felt

1137
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,120
I'd never get to play a female lead

1138
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,780
or anything like that.

1139
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,560
It never even crossed my mind.

1140
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,240
Because the shows I loved watching

1141
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,000
were things like "Drawing Sword"

1142
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,400
and "Empresses in the Palace."

1143
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,720
They all felt like such epic dramas.

1144
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,720
So I never thought

1145
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,680
I'd become a leading actress.

1146
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,640
But there's one thing

1147
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,800
that's always been true:

1148
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,960
Even if only one person liked me,

1149
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,760
I wanted that person to know

1150
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,720
that I was really trying my best.

1151
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,160
Because...

1152
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,760
from childhood till now,

1153
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,120
up to this very moment,

1154
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,400
I feel this is the only thing I truly did right.

1155
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,600
Actually...

1156
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,880
in the last couple of months,

1157
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,880
there were times I really felt...

1158
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:10,840
I might not...

1159
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,640
I might not be able to act anymore.

1160
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,480
So,

1161
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,880
being able to stand here and see you all today

1162
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,840
really means a lot...

1163
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,600
No tears.

1164
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,940
But I swear it's because I'm happy.

1165
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:37,220
Yeah, I really am crying from happiness.

1166
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:37,680
Because...

1167
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,280
yeah, it's all just been so hard.

1168
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,520
But...

1169
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,680
I realize...

1170
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,240
all of you are here with me.

1171
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,040
You drag me back to this stage.

1172
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,840
And it makes me feel

1173
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,120
that even being sick isn't such a big deal,

1174
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,800
because I can still

1175
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,440
do what I love to do.

1176
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,040
Thank you.

1177
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,460
Let's give a round of applause for Lusi.

1178
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,660
Let's tell her

1179
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,680
that every single day to come,

1180
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,460
no matter what she's experiencing,

1181
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,500
she has to remember

1182
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,920
so many people here today

1183
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,240
are sending her

1184
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,320
endless love through their applause and gaze.

1185
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:23,660
All right?

1186
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,780
Applause for Lusi

1187
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,820
so that whenever

1188
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,960
she needs strength,

1189
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,760
she can remember how solid and priceless

1190
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,880
tonight's company is.

1191
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:52,440
- Zhao Lusi! - Zhao Lusi!

1192
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,320
Amazing!

1193
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,040
I think love should be spoken out loud

1194
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,680
and feelings should be let out.

1195
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,480
And it's okay to let the tears flow freely.

1196
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,640
The name you were shouting

1197
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,920
carries so much power.

1198
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,400
You're not only pouring strength into it,

1199
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,680
I believe every time you say it,

1200
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:09,940
your own heart

1201
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,480
feels that same impact.

1202
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,200
I hope all of you, like Lusi,

1203
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,780
can bravely face

1204
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,700
all the unknowns in life

1205
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,760
and every challenge.

1206
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,560
Just like we saw in her today,

1207
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,200
no matter what she's been through,

1208
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,560
she still uses her small shoulders

1209
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,820
to carry

1210
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,180
such a dazzling stage!

1211
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,860
Zhao Lusi,

1212
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:29,800
keep going!

1213
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:45,080
- Zhao Lusi! - Zhao Lusi!

1214
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,580
Thank you, everyone.

1215
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:48,080
And...

1216
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:49,760
there are many friends

1217
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,320
we need to thank today.

1218
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:51,900
Yes.

1219
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:53,480
First,

1220
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,200
we want to thank

1221
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,440
our concert title sponsor, ROSYDOEDIAN.

1222
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,640

Thanks to our special sponsor, PECHOIN.

Thank you!

1227
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,640
Thanks to our industry sponsor, moonmoi.

1228
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,120
Thank you!

1229
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,680
Thanks to our industry sponsor, PELLIOT.

1230
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,240
Thank you!

1231
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,280
I also want to thank my mom and dad

1232
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,580
and my whole team

1233
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:34,680
for the trust you've given me.

1234
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,720
And thanks to all the dear friends here tonight.

1235
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,680
I don't praise you often.

1236
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,240
But you really are

1237
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,920
a beam of light in my heart!

1238
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
I hope you all can

1239
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,080
keep getting better.

1240
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,760
Every one of you,

1241
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,760
keep getting better and better.

1242
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,900
And I also want to thank

1243
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,780
my newly founded studio.

1244
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,560
May it be prosperous!

1245
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,440
Thank you,

1246
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:09,920
Mr. Li Wei.

1247
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,720
Thank you, Michael, our music director.

1248
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,120
Thank you to our band.

1249
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,800
Thanks to the Infinity Diverse Generation dance crew.

1250
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,120
Thanks to the Oh MyGod directing team.

1251
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,860
Thank you.

1252
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,920
In just thirty-six days of preparation,

1253
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,140
you made it possible for me to meet my fans

1254
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,940
and share a wonderful night like this.

1255
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:29,900
Thank you all!

1256
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,740
Thank you!

1257
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:33,740
Thank you, truly!

1258
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,520
Thank you!

1259
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,840
And we also want to thank

1260
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,560
the public security, culture, fire and other departments

1261
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,660
for their strong support.

1262
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,180
Thanks as well to our venue,

1263
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,080
the Chengdu High-Tech Sports Center.

1264
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,080
And thanks to all our Chengdu hometown friends.

1265
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,800
Thank you!

1266
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,560
Now let's wipe away our tears

1267
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,360
and welcome the next stage,

1268
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:00,680
okay?

1269
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,560
Okay.

1270
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,360
We'll hand the stage back to Lusi.

1271
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,080
Please.

1272
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:12,820
["Hidden Heart" lyrics: Er Shui, music: Chen Zhuni]

1273
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,580
A round of applause for Lusi!

1274
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,620
Tonight's performances have been amazing.

1275
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,580
No matter the style,

1276
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,340
Lusi's voice can bring it

1277
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,620
to everyone through music.

1278
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,100
So, what's next?

1279
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,460
Now it's time for some interaction.

1280
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,740
In this segment,

1281
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:17,940
we're going to quiz

1282
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,340
everyone here.

1283
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:21,980
We'll pick a few people

1284
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,420
who are willing to answer

1285
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,780
these nine questions in my hand.

1286
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,740
Our staff

1287
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,980
will bring the mic

1288
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,180
right over to you.

1289
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:31,380
You can use this chance

1290
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:32,780
to answer the question

1291
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,380
and say what you'd like to say to Lusi.

1292
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:34,860
How does that sound?

1293
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:36,460
All right.

1294
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,020
We'll start on this side.

1295
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,500
I know you're super enthusiastic here.

1296
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,380
Who wants to answer a question?

1297
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,340
If you get it wrong, you'll have to leave right away.

1298
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:48,140
Kidding.

1299
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:48,780
Nothing like that.

1300
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:50,540
Let me see.

1301
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,580
Our staff has reached you,

1302
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:52,980
right?

1303
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:53,420
Okay, they're there.

1304
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,180
All right, let me see

1305
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,180
who's feeling confident enough to try.

1306
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:59,100
Let's go with her!

1307
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,260
The one holding the fan sign.

1308
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,100
Yeah.

1309
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:01,780
In the purple top,

1310
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,500
same color as mine.

1311
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Yes, you!

1312
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,620
Pass her the mic.

1313
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,980
Take a breath first.

1314
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,860
Introduce yourself.

1315
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,580
What should we call you?

1316
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,900
Hello, everyone.

1317
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,420
I'm Xiaoxuan.

1318
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:17,900
Xiaoxuan,

1319
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,540
could you share your seat number

1320
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,620
so our staff can note it down?

1321
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,540
Section 205, Row 3, Seat 1.

1322
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,180
All right.

1323
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:25,940
Got it.

1324
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:26,780
Okay, Xiaoxuan,

1325
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,780
pick a number first.

1326
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,220
From one to nine.

1327
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,620
Six.

1328
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,460
So decisive.

1329
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,100
Okay, let's see.

1330
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,380
Xiaoxuan's question is...

1331
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:37,220
Xiaoxuan,

1332
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,140
how many points did you get in the Canelé quiz?

1333
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:43,420
When grabbing tickets,

1334
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,700
what was your score on the test?

1335
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,020
Do you remember?

1336
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,700
It didn't show the score.

1337
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,140
So you passed straight away, right?

1338
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:48,820
All right then.

1339
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,980
Let's open envelope number six.

1340
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:53,020
Here we go.

1341
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:54,260
"Prove you're a fan of Zhao Lusi

1342
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,060
in one sentence,

1343
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,340
but you can't use

1344
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,260
'sweet' or 'cute' in it."

1345
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,740
Just one sentence.

1346
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:01,420
You can take a moment

1347
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,700
to think how you'll prove it.

1348
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,660
All eyes are on you.

1349
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,460
You've got this, Xiaoxuan.

1350
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,140
Don't worry, just kidding.

1351
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:12,220
Relax.

1352
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,700
Here she goes. Xiaoxuan looks ready.

1353
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,940
Every person

1354
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,500
is special.

1355
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,020
Every girl

1356
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,140
is the most special of all.

1357
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,020
"Special" is what matters most.

1358
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:35,780
Can I say something to Lusi too?

1359
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:36,580
Of course.

1360
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,780
Will she hear me?

1361
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,460
Of course.

1362
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,860
She's wearing in-ears right now.

1363
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:40,580
She can hear everything.

1364
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,060
Can I say something from the heart?

1365
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,020
I'm a fan

1366
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,100
who's loved Lusi for eight years.

1367
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,860
Ever since the very beginning, with Luo Feifei,

1368
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,220
I've liked you all the way.

1369
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:55,340
This journey hasn't been easy for any of us,

1370
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,860
but I can clearly see

1371
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,740
every effort you make,

1372
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,900
how you pour in your heart on every stage

1373
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,100
and in every drama,

1374
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:04,260
and how you improve.

1375
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,580
We see it all.

1376
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,940
Zhao Lusi,

1377
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,140
you're truly amazing!

1378
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,780
Every single one of us Canelés

1379
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:12,300
will always believe in you,

1380
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,780
support you and stay by your side,

1381
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,820
forever.

1382
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:16,420
Zhao Lusi,

1383
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,740
you can charge ahead bravely.

1384
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,140
Your Canelés will always be there.

1385
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:22,260
Thank you!

1386
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,180
Thank you, Xiaoxuan, for speaking

1387
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,020
everyone's heart.

1388
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,140
Xiaoxuan, you're just as special.

1389
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,140
You're our very first one tonight.

1390
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,900
Wonderful!

1391
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,820
We'll keep your seat number on record.

1392
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,860
I'll tell you later

1393
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:32,860
what you'll receive.

1394
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,540
All right,

1395
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,060
let's move over here!

1396
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,580
Who wants to answer a question?

1397
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,380
Let me see.

1398
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:45,300
Who?

1399
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:46,860
How about her?

1400
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,380
The one holding the hand banner.

1401
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,020
The one with the big banner.

1402
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:51,940
Okay,

1403
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:53,020
the one in white.

1404
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:53,900
Come on.

1405
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,660
Please introduce yourself.

1406
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:59,980
I'm Jov, from Singapore.

1407
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,940
Welcome!

1408
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,820
Thanks for coming such a long way.

1409
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,220
Welcome.

1410
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:08,020
Our whole row here are overseas Lusi fans.

1411
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,060
Welcome!

1412
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,220
Welcome to all of you!

1413
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,460
Which number will you pick?

1414
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,620
Nine.

1415
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,300
Okay.

1416
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:14,780
Your question is:

1417
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:16,780
If Lusi appeared right next to you,

1418
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:19,620
what little thing would you most want to do with her?

1419
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,180
Can I give her a hug?

1420
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,500
So just a hug is enough, right?

1421
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,220
A hug full of love, right?

1422
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,460
Why do you want to hug Lusi?

1423
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,980
Because...

1424
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,780
because I love her.

1425
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,540
Love means hugging,

1426
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,820
and love means meeting often.

1427
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,260
Thanks all for coming from so far away.

1428
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:39,260
Could I ask for your seat number?

1429
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,900
It's...

1430
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:44,340
Section 218, Row 1, Seat 16.

1431
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:44,820
All right.

1432
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,380
Director, please note that down.

1433
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,620
In a bit we'll...

1434
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:50,860
Can I speak on their behalf too?

1435
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,420
You can.

1436
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,020
Here, we also have fans

1437
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,460
from Thailand,

1438
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,460
Korea,

1439
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:57,180
Russia,

1440
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,580
Malaysia...

1441
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,700
fans from many countries.

1442
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,660
There are a lot of overseas Lusi fans.

1443
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,740
This time, it's all thanks to the fans

1444
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:11,620
back in China too.

1445
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,220
They helped us a lot.

1446
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:15,100
What a kind of bond.

1447
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,180
Yes.

1448
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,140
Because Lusi once said

1449
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,540
"love can give everyone strength,"

1450
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,820
we also hope

1451
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:24,260
our love from overseas and from home

1452
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,980
can give her strength.

1453
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:26,540
Thank you!

1454
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:27,580
Thank you!

1455
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,140
I hope Canelés all over the world

1456
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,020
can all become good friends

1457
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,260
and have lots of chances to come to Chengdu.

1458
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:34,620
Okay?

1459
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:35,300
Welcome, all of you!

1460
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,620
Stay tuned for what's next.

1461
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,380
As for the two of you just now,

1462
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:40,860
our friend over here

1463
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,540
and Xiaoxuan there,

1464
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,260
after the show,

1465
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,180
our staff will do their best

1466
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,260
to contact you

1467
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,740
and put a small token of our thanks

1468
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,820
right into your hands.

1469
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,580
Thank all of you

1470
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,180
for supporting tonight's concert,

1471
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,980
especially everyone who's traveled so far.

1472
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:53,820
Next up,

1473
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,500
let's all get ready together

1474
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,740
for our last big party tonight!

1475
01:35:58,740 --> 01:35:59,540
Are you ready?

1476
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,780
We're ready!

1477
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,260
Please welcome Zhao Lusi!

1478
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,300
[Don't Wanna Know]

1479
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,460
[Lyrics & music: Brian Lee, vocal coach: Mischke]

1480
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,460
Come on!

1481
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:36,940
Thank you!

1482
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,420
Wow, here comes an angel!

1483
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:04,900
[2025.11.04, Band Rehearsal Day]

1484
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,380
We start from here, right?

1485
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:08,940
Okay.

1486
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,620
Can you catch the beat?

1487
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,500
I can.

1488
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,420
I can't catch if from you two,

1489
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,140
but I can just follow the keyboard.

1490
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:31,820
Your cue coming in is spot on

1491
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:32,980
Because I was really focused.

1492
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:35,500
I locked in on this one thing.

1493
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,860
Want to run through this song again?

1494
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:57,420
Yeah.

1495
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,060
Okay.

1496
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:17,060
[2025.11.05, Choreography Day]

1497
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,220
I'm worried I'll get nervous and grab their hair.

1498
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:47,620
Both rap bits are just the dance, so it feels off..

1499
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:50,500
So if your lip-sync can match

1500
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,140
the Sichuan line too...

1501
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,340
Wow!

1502
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:19,020
You're all in pairs,

1503
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:21,260
and I'm the only one here alone.

1504
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:26,660
[2025.11.06, Stage Rehearsal Day]

1505
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:36,220
Right, this is where you do this.

1506
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,780
Yes.

1507
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:03,780
Let's do that again. Okay.

1508
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:30,660
[2025.11.08, The Promised Day]

1509
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:33,620
["Only One"]
You knew I'd come back, right?

1510
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,100
[Lyrics & music: Pan Yun'an; Adaptation: G.E.M.]

1511
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,020
You all know this one, right?

1512
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,980
There are so much words,

1513
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,540
a whole year's worth of words,

1514
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:24,180
that I can't possibly finish tonight

1515
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,780
But I've realized I really cry a lot.

1516
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,060
Ever since

1517
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,620
that big breakdown,

1518
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,260
I can no longer hold in

1519
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:36,460
any little emotion.

1520
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,300
But for this last song,

1521
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,500
why did I choose "Only One"?

1522
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,780
Because this past year,

1523
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,620
I really haven't been able

1524
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,980
to listen to it alone at home.

1525
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:57,260
But every time after an event,

1526
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:59,300
I see you all singing it yourselves.

1527
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,220
So today,

1528
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,980
I want to sing it together with you.

1529
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:09,980
And after that, I won't fear

1530
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,460
this song anymore.

1531
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,820
Okay?

1532
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,700
Okay!

1533
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:15,900
Are you ready?

1534
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:23,860
Bye bye!

1535
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:55,500
It's so hard

1536
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,980
to say goodbye to you.

1537
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,500
But I believe

1538
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,860
brief partings

1539
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,500
are for better reunions.

1540
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:03,220
Once again thank you

1541
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,620
to every passionate Canelés here

1542
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,180
with us tonight.

1543
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:06,980
Thanks for your

1544
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,020
cheers,

1545
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:09,300
screams,

1546
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,260
singing,

1547
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:11,340
your hand dances

1548
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:12,380
and all your warmth.

1549
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,500
I'm sure Lusi will hold it all in her heart

1550
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,420
as the strength to keep going.

1551
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:17,860
Tonight,

1552
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,860
our concert is called "Miss You".

1553
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,380
If I had to add one more line

1554
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:22,980
to that name, it would be

1555
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:24,660
"like the first dew".

1556
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,300
"Missing you,

1557
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,900
like the first dew".

1558
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,020
I hope that every time we meet,

1559
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:30,100
it can be like

1560
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,780
the dew at daybreak,

1561
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:32,820
clear,

1562
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,260
pure,

1563
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,740
and full of the sweetness of our very first meeting.

1564
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,580
One more round of applause for yourselves

1565
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,060
and for the one we all love most,

1566
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:43,980
Zhao Lusi!

1567
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,660
Blessings to Lusi and to all of you!

1568
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,380
I hope your lives are filled with joy!

1569
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:48,540
And may every day

1570
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,740
shine bright!

1571
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:50,980
See you soon.

1572
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:51,820
Good night!

1573
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,940
Thank you to everyone on this side!

You've all worked so hard!
