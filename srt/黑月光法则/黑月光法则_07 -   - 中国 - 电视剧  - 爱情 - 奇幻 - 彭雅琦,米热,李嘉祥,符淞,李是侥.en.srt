=Episode 7=

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,719
Madam.

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,280
Go and tell Yan

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,159
that I have returned.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,159
Yes.

11
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,600
(Dongfang Group)

12
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,599
So melodramatic.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,079
If not for Zhitao today,

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,280
you wouldn't have seen Mom.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,359
These are for Zhitao.

16
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,040
Later, let Yan

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,719
arrange the best hospital for you.

18
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,079
It's all right.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,719
I'm used to it.

20
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,280
It has been investigated.

21
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,439
The falling glass

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,719
was indeed a coincidence.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Mom fell and got some scratches.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,760
The bodyguard was also badly injured.

25
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,120
It's nothing.

26
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,359
Since you saved my mother,

27
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,359
what else do you want?

28
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,200
Just say it.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Dongfang Xi.

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,239
Why must you
measure everything with money?

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Do you have no humanity at all?

32
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,040
Auntie.

33
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,599
I saved you, not for money.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,120
Why call me Auntie?

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,879
I will acknowledge you as my daughter.

36
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,280
From now on, we are family.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,879
Come.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,319
Mom.

39
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,000
Sit down.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,719
If you want to do something, come at me.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Don't touch my family.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
I didn't.

43
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
You don't want money.

44
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,800
Then you must want fame and status.

45
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,080
I am not that materialistic.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,719
I just wanted to save Mom.

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,400
You're not materialistic?

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,400
If not, why save my mother

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,639
instead of the bodyguard?

50
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,240
Isn't it because my mother
looks wealthy,

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,759
while the bodyguard
is just a subordinate?

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,639
I...

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,800
I didn't.

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,919
You were once my brother's secretary.

55
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,360
How could you not know
what my mother looks like?

56
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,400
Mr. Yan.

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,879
I...

58
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,319
You say you want nothing,

59
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
yet you accepted
the gifts without hesitation.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
You also agreed to be her goddaughter
without a second thought.

61
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,840
Bai Zhitao.

62
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,800
You

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,439
stay away

64
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,479
from my mother.

65
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,639
Mom.

66
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm sorry, Auntie.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think it's better
if we remain strangers.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Please don't get upset
with your daughter.

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,240
Xi.

70
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,759
Didn't Yan just say

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,120
it was all a coincidence?

72
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,520
Besides,

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Zhitao saved my life.

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,280
And you,

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
you left without a word for three years.

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,680
Did you ever think about how I felt?

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,520
Mom...

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,479
From what I see,

79
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,120
Zhitao is more like
my real daughter than you are.

80
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
You have truly disappointed me!

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,439
Mom.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:44,919
Mom.

83
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,639
Mom.

84
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,520
Mom.

85
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,159
Call the doctor, quick!

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,639
Mom!

87
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:53,387
(In surgery)

88
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,199
Doctor, how is she?

89
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,840
Madam was overly agitated,
which led to an ischaemic coma.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,159
She urgently needs a transfusion.

91
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,240
But Madam has Rh-negative blood.

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
I can donate blood.

93
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,719
Close relatives cannot donate.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,199
I'll contact the blood bank.

95
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,199
I've already asked.

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
The soonest will still take a few hours.

97
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,319
But we can't wait
even a minute right now.

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,399
Then...

99
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,199
I am Rh negative blood.

100
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,560
I can give Auntie blood.

101
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,240
What do you want?

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,560
Dongfang Xi.

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,120
I want you to apologise to Yunzhou.

104
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,120
- No.
- No.

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
I can give up everything else.

106
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,480
Yunzhou is in pain at home.

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,399
All of this is your doing.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,480
Doesn't it deserve at least an apology?

109
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,480
Bai Zhitao.

110
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,519
We could easily tie you up

111
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,480
and force your blood.

112
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,920
As a foster daughter,

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,079
shouldn't you also
take some responsibility?

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,199
Quick, there's no time.

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Dongfang Xi, don't you want
to save your mother?

116
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,759
I agree.

117
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,562
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,959
Yunzhou.

119
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
Your girlfriend now

120
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,959
really thinks she's something.

121
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,199
I can't see her all day.

122
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,199
Where has she gone?

123
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,279
Is this Bai Zhitao's house?

124
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,879
I am her boyfriend.

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
What is it?

126
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,319
Bai Zhitao saved Madam Dongfang.

127
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,879
These are all gifts.

128
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,959
This...

129
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,959
Is this true?

130
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,680
How could anything
from the Dongfang family be fake?

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
Yunzhou.

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
Madam Dongfang has accepted me
as her goddaughter.

133
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,439
Zhitao, you truly are my lucky star.

134
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,079
Yunzhou.

135
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
You've suffered a lot recently.

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,759
I want you to meet someone.

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,839
When you see her,

138
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,040
you will feel better.

139
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,439
Who?

140
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,160
Dongfang Xi.

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,480
Ms. Dongfang is here
to apologise to you.

142
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,639
Dongfang Xi.

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,879
So you've come to this day.

144
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,439
I see the Dongfang family
doesn't value you much.

145
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,040
Even a goddaughter
can order you to apologise.

146
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,079
Ye Yunzhou.

147
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
I really should apologise to you.

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,439
Of course.

149
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,199
You clearly didn't have
the ability to be vice president,

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,639
yet because of me,

151
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,279
you were given that position.

152
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,519
After letting you dream of gold,
it was shattered.

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I am truly sorry.

154
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,319
Dongfang Xi!

155
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,079
You've sold fish for three years.

156
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,439
You're already steeped in the smell.

157
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,319
What young lady?

158
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,360
In the Dongfang family,

159
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,879
your status is beneath
even a goddaughter.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,439
Look at the state you are in now.

161
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,160
Zhitao looks more like the daughter
of the Dongfang family than you.

162
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,519
She even feels more like
my own daughter than you do.

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,240
Is that enough?

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Is that enough?

165
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,120
It is not enough.

166
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,680
Yan.

167
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,399
It is just a bit of dirty water.

168
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,879
It should not have been splashed on you.

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
And it should never touch
the Dongfang family.

170
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,680
Mr. Yan.

171
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,839
You cannot interfere in this matter.

172
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,040
I have not accepted her apology yet.

173
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,120
The apology has already
been made to you.

174
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
Whether you accept it or not,

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,879
that is your own decision.

176
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,600
Dongfang Yan.

177
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,959
Zhitao is now the goddaughter
of the Dongfang family.

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,079
You cannot use the power
of the Dongfang Group against me.

179
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,879
Remember this.

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,959
It is Dongfang Yan
who is standing against Ye Yunzhou,

181
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,279
not the president of the Dongfang Group.

182
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,399
Yan.

183
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:14,680
Yan...

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,439
Do you know what you have done wrong?

185
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,000
Yan.

186
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
A man without ruthlessness
cannot stand firm.

187
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,959
When you dealt with Ye Yunzhou,

188
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,319
you were not thorough enough.

189
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,079
Mr. Yan.

190
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,079
Your coat.

191
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,879
(Big Brother is right.)

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
(This time it was my foolishness.)

193
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,562
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

194
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,919
"Addicted to Toxic Love".

195
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,080
What a trashy cliche novel.

196
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,440
I never thought Yan would read this too.

197
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,679
The heroine, Bai Zhitao,

198
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,240
and the hero,

199
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,919
Dongfang Yan?

200
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,000
The two of them accidentally kiss.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,039
One kiss seals their fate
and begins a painful romance.

202
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,879
The story...

203
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,840
Your coat.

204
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,159
Thank you.

205
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,080
You are wearing too little.

206
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,480
