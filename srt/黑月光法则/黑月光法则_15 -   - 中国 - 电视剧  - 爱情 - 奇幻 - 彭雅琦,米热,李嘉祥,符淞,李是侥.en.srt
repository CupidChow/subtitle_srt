=Episode 15=

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,479
Alright, let's call it a day.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,640
Xi, I have something to tell you.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,959
It's time to change the cord
on your jade pendant.

10
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,879
I don't want to.

11
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,280
Then tell me when you do.

12
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,280
What did you just want to say?

13
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,560
Let's talk later.

14
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,040
You know where to find me.

15
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,519
I'll go see Zhan later.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,159
I didn't ask anything.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,480
Sister-in-law, how's it going today?

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,640
Did you meet Dongfang Chen?

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
What's wrong with you?

20
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,599
You can't even handle such a small task?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
Calling you sister-in-law is wasted.

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
Watch your mouth.

23
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,400
What's the use of chasing stars?

24
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,879
Can chasing idols feed you?

25
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,479
You spent so much money on him.

26
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,639
Does he even know who you are?

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
Yunzhou.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Go back.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,039
Yunzhou, it's my fault.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,680
I wronged you.

31
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,840
In my heart, we're already family.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
Doing anything for family is worth it.

33
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,719
Then can you help me take this

34
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,000
to the Dongfang family?

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,560
What is it?

36
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,000
Some of my past work.

37
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,360
I want to make a comeback.

38
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,680
Really?

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
Alright, I'll support you.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,639
Go ahead.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,199
(I was supposed to drug Dongfang Yan)

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
(and expose his scandal,)

43
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,680
(but unexpectedly)

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,000
(I captured something even juicier.)

45
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,479
(Dongfang Xi, you'll beg me in tears.)

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,199
What is it?

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Miss.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,199
Master and Madam know you went missing

49
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,800
for Ye Yunzhou.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,560
They're furious right now.

51
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,199
Calm them down.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
I'll be right back.

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,360
Master and Madam aren't home.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,439
They're at Longquan Teahouse.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
(Oh no.)

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,159
(In the novel, my parents
seeking revenge,)

57
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,520
(accidentally caused
Ye Yunzhou's death.)

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,280
(This is the classic
tragic lovers' setup,)

59
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,680
(but it turns my parents
into murderers.)

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,479
Tell me,

61
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,000
does Xi like someone?

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Since she was little,

63
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,280
when has your daughter
ever followed your plans?

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,319
I'm just worried.

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
The eldest and second
are more worried than you.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
You mean,

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
they both like Xi too?

68
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,800
Only you and Chen haven't noticed,

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
you're still busy finding her a fiance.

70
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,560
That will be fine.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,240
After all, they're kids we raised.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Yes, I think so too.

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,480
This girl

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
never let me rest easy.

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
Disappeared for three years
without a word.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,879
Even argues with me over a goddaughter.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,199
That day I fainted in the street,

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,759
it was my goddaughter who gave me blood.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
What a coincidence.

80
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
She saved you twice.

81
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,720
Yes.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,360
She has the same rare blood type as me.

83
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,639
Bring the family doctor from last time.

84
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,759
Here's what happened.

85
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,360
When Miss Xi apologized to Ye Yunzhou,

86
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,360
she was humiliated.

87
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,040
Luckily, Yan was there.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,240
Now do you understand?

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,160
Using the blood transfusion
to threaten me,

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,879
forcing my daughter
to apologize to that scum?

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,399
Where are you going?

92
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,040
To demand justice for my daughter!

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
No.

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
I must stop them from
taking revenge on Ye Yunzhou.

95
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,399
(This is a key plot point.)

96
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,639
(You cannot change it.)

97
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,040
(Last time you already
learned the lesson.)

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,160
(To defy fate)

99
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,079
(is impossible.)

100
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,639
Shut up!

101
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,439
Mom.

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,399
You're going to Ye Yunzhou?

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,399
Of course, to settle the score.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
That's not how you settle scores.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,399
If you act rashly,

106
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,759
what if he retaliates against Xi?

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,279
Exactly. Scum like Ye Yunzhou

108
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,199
isn't worth your hands.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,839
You dare talk?

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,639
You disappeared three years
without a word,

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
only to bring back this trash.

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,519
And now you stop me?

113
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,279
