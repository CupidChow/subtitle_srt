Xi…

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,320
No!

9
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,159
Dongfang Yan!

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,920
Dongfang Yan, snap out of it!

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Someone's coming.

12
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,960
Someone's coming!

13
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,120
Mr. Yan?

14
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,400
Mr. Yan?

15
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,120
Shh.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
Don't move.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,079
Strange.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
He drank all of it.

19
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,319
But where is he?

20
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,239
(So she's the one who drugged him.)

21
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,239
(Who is she?)

22
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,400
Did someone get to him first?

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,319
Dongfang Chen,

24
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,719
you're filming
at the company today, right?

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
Keep an eye on the woman

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,240
who just left Yan's office.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,599
Got it. What's going on?

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,759
I'll fill you in later.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,759
Assistant He,

30
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,360
come to Mr. Yan's office now
and take him home.

31
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,199
(He's burning up.)

32
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,560
(I hope his brain doesn't get fried.)

33
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,840
Bring a doctor with you

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,439
and make it quick.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,080
(How did things come to this?)

36
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,919
How much longer till we get there?

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
About five minutes.

38
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,400
(The novel only said Yan was drugged.)

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
(It never mentioned who did it.)

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
(The only focus was on
that one-night stand with Bai Zhitao.)

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Water…

42
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,520
Water…

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,039
Water…

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
Yan,

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
what do you think
she wanted by drugging you?

46
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,759
Your looks?

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
Well, you do have some charm.

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,639
Climbing the ladder, maybe.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Even in this state,

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,080
you can still think clearly.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Then why don't you
give me your analysis?

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,080
Yan, give me your analysis…

53
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,039
Your assistant is still here!

54
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,719
Mr. Chen…

55
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,390
Have you seen this woman?

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,719
Is that her?

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Drive.

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
That's her!

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Let's go.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,439
I need your help.

61
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on!

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,800
She came to the bar before sunset.

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,519
She might be here to see someone.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,839
What's wrong?

65
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,639
Nothing.

66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
You're a famous person.

67
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,839
You should disguise yourself.

68
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,720
You're right.

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,319
Come on!

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
Where's the woman who just came in?

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,319
Who?

72
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,279
Never saw her.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,839
She's right there!

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Stop!

75
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,040
What do you think you're doing?

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
Yang Xiaoxin, stay behind me.

77
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,120
Hey, you…

78
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,680
You look familiar.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,879
If you want to get to her,
you'll have to go through me.

80
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,279
How sweet.

81
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,160
Get him!

82
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,319
Stop!

83
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,480
Not the face.

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,959
My face is insured.

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Pick up, Xi!

86
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,920
Hang in there, Dongfang Yan.

87
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,920
The doctor's almost here.

88
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,439
Assistant He,
when will the doctor arrive?

89
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,920
Dongfang Yan just passed out.

90
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,319
At least ten minutes.

91
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,199
The doctor says
there's an emergency shot in the kit.

92
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,519
You need to give it to Mr. Yan now.

93
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
What if I inject the wrong place?

94
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,040
Make a mark.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,839
One shot above his left chest.

96
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,279
A mark…

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
But I don't know how to give injections.

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Ms. Dongfang,

99
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,839
there's no other choice.

100
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,240
Either you find a woman for Mr. Yan,

101
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,279
or you take the risk

102
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,600
and inject the spot near his heart.

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,759
If you wait any longer,
his heart will give out.

104
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,800
You have to decide now!

105
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,240
Hello?

106
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,199
Hello?

107
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Dongfang Yan!

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,279
Dongfang Yan!

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,639
