=Episode 13=

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,079
No wonder they call her
the female Wong Kar-wai.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,960
Look how serious
the atmosphere is here.

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,479
Guan Jiahui is Guan Jiahui.

10
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,799
Why stick a man's title
on a female director?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,159
Cut.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,079
Wardrobe and props,
come check everything.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,239
As expected from Vita.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,799
Even you look decent in it.

15
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,799
Those not involved, clear the set.

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,159
Don't hold up the shoot.

17
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,040
Step aside if you're not part of this.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,359
Oh.

19
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:26,680
Got it.

20
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,439
Do your best.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
Let's test an explosion here.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Everyone, stay sharp.

23
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,560
Make way, make way!

24
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,280
Does she have something against us?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Guan Jiahui is known
for hating people with connections.

26
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,439
She probably thinks
Dongfang Group invested in this drama

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
just to shove Chen into the cast

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,599
and make him the lead.

29
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,079
But our dear Chen

30
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,319
only has his face going for him.

31
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,560
You know what?

32
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,000
Just four months.

33
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,799
Four months of acting classes,

34
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,159
and he scared off eight teachers.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
No wonder people say
our third brother is a nepotism hire.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,159
Action.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,759
What happened?

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Relax.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,719
They're testing the blast.

40
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,240
Dongfang Chen!

41
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,199
Chen is just
testing the explosion effect.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
What's wrong?

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Did it scare you?

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,639
Dongfang Chen!

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Why are you calling me?

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,039
What are you doing?

47
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you trying to ruin my face?

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
(Oh no, this is where Dongfang Chen)

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
(gets disfigured in the novel.)

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,039
(It happens here.)

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,960
Director Guan, the male lead is injured.

52
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,000
Why are you still practicing dance?

53
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,840
Your face is ruined.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,639
Your career is totally over.

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,800
And now the Dongfang family is bankrupt.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
You'd better figure out

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,159
how you're going to pay
back your 30 million penalty fee.

58
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,759
Don't talk to him like that!

59
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,599
Are you okay?

60
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,000
Ms. Bai.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,319
Ever since I got disfigured,

62
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,039
you're the only one
who still treats me kindly.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,240
It's alright.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,159
Things will get better.

65
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,039
(Everyone says all I have is my face,)

66
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,759
(that I'm just a pretty vase.)

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
(Dongfang Group, the world I loved,
abandoned me once I was disfigured.)

68
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,372
(Only Zhitao never judged me.)

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
(But I can't hold on any longer.)

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,279
Xi?

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Didn't sleep well last night?

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
You've been spacing out.

73
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,959
I had a nightmare.

74
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,879
I realized that nightmare
has always been there.

75
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,800
Have some guts.

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll take you out for a walk.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm fine.

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm just a little worried
about Dongfang Chen.

79
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,199
Is that blast even safe?

80
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,839
His face is his livelihood after all.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,639
(I need to stay close to Dongfang Chen)

82
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,360
(to keep an eye on him.)

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,600
I want to get a little closer.

84
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,680
Go ahead.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,800
You three,

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,959
don't stand so close.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,639
Keep an eye on Dongfang Chen.

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,879
He's way too close to the blast.

89
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,040
It could be dangerous.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,839
You're acting kind of strange today.

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,279
(This isn't right.)

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,759
(Something's off.)

93
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,160
(After Dongfang Chen was disfigured,
his only attachment was Bai Zhitao.)

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,000
(She saved him and protected him.)

95
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,160
(So Bai Zhitao should be on set too.)

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,680
(Only the hero and heroine matter.)

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,600
(Everyone else is supposed
to sacrifice for their love.)

98
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,040
(Does showcasing heroine's kindness)

99
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,680
(mean Dongfang Chen
has to be disfigured,)

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
(or even die?)

101
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,160
(The sacrifices of
a side character for the leads' romance)

102
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,160
(are what stick with the audience.)

103
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,759
(This is the so-called BE aesthetic.)

104
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,390
I refuse to suffer
for the sake of suffering.

105
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,839
I won't let Bai Zhitao
become collateral damage.

106
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Tell me where she is.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,759
(No comment.)

108
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,639
(Dongfang Chen isn't with Bai Zhitao.)

109
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,399
(Does this mean)

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,680
(there's no way to change the plot?)

111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Yang Xiaoxin!

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
