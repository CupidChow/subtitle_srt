=Episode 3=

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,560
We're not related by blood anyway.

8
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,960
Don't say such scary things.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
Since you don't have such ideas,

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,000
watch your words and actions.

11
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,560
We haven't met for so long.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,359
You suddenly said something so scary.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
We haven't met for so long?

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,599
Didn't you just drive us away yesterday?

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,439
What's wrong?

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,400
You don't want to be Qiao Xi

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
and decided to be Dongfang Xi?

18
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,480
Yan.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,120
I was wrong.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,439
That person before

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,680
wasn't me at all.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Just think of me

23
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,439
as finally waking up,

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,560
determined to change,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,719
turn over a new leaf,

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,439
and start fresh.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,719
Get up.

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,079
I really am sorry this time.

29
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,959
I'll never have anything to do

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,000
with Ye Yunzhou again.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,480
Let me come home, Yan.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,560
Get up.

33
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,879
If you want to come home,

34
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,439
you don't need anyone's permission.

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,000
No matter what decisions you make,

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
you will always be
the heiress of the Dongfang family.

37
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,200
Alright.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,959
Now that you're back,

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,840
stop hiding.

40
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,359
No need to sneak into trunks

41
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,519
or hide in my room.

42
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,759
But

43
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,680
do Mom and Dad know

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,479
I disappeared for three years
because of a scumbag?

45
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,639
Don't worry.

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,759
We've covered it up well.

47
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,159
Since you've returned this time,

48
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,599
we'll throw you a homecoming party.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,039
Three years ago,

50
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,319
Mom and Dad bought you a small island.

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
How about we hold

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,759
this homecoming party on it?

53
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,120
Yan.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,560
How did Ye Yunzhou

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,439
become the vice president
of our subsidiary?

56
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,360
Is it because of me?

57
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,919
Don't worry.

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
I'll arrange to revoke his position.

59
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,319
No need.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,719
What's the matter?

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,199
Do you have an idea?

62
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,360
Ye Yunzhou

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,240
values face and status most.

64
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,840
This time,

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,240
I'll tear away his mask

66
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,080
and take his status.

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,280
How about that?

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,439
Alright.

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
As long as you're happy.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Let's go.

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
I'll take you home.

72
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Zhan?

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,680
Xi.

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
Why are you in my room?

75
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,919
I forgot this was your room.

76
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,360
I've been here

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
more often than you.

78
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,520
This time I'm back,

79
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,479
I won't leave again.

80
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,520
Xi.

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,479
Welcome home.

82
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Miss, time to get up.

83
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:05,452
♪My eyes are wide open♪

84
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:09,900

91
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,399
Today, you're going to Vita as Ms. Xi.

92
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,680
Work can be painful,

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,959
so I prepared a surprise

94
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,759
overnight.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,759
It's waiting in your office.

96
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,590
You're going straight to work
after coming home?

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
It's not like our family went bankrupt.

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,360
Could this be a cruise ship?

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
After all, you're Ms. Xi now.

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,759
This Sea Carnival

101
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,399
barely matches your status.

102
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,199
Thank you, Zhan.

103
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,920
Mr. Yan won this pink diamond
in an auction.

104
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,959
He broke the highest
diamond price record in nearly a decade.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,360
And he designed the necklace himself.

106
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,240
Is this all?

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
I know you're greedy.

108
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,199
These are just land deeds and property rights
from various countries.

109
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,720
Whether you want to build villas
or theme parks is up to you.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,890
All that matters is that you're happy.

111
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,040
Thank you.

112
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:13,879
All of you.

113
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,720
Alright, I need to keep trying on clothes

114
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,800
and head to the office.

115
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
There's more to watch

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
at Vita today.

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,240
- Good morning, Mr. Ye.
- Good morning, Mr. Ye.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,160
Keep it low-key.

119
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,680
No need for such a big scene.

120
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,399
This is
what the design department should do.

121
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,959
What's your name?

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,079
My surname is Dong.

123
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,279
They all call me Dong.

124
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,639
You can just call me Dong.

125
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,160
But

126
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,920
didn't the notice say

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,199
the one coming

128
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,560
was

129
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,639
a female president?

130
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,360
What do you know?

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Why would Dongfang Group

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
send a woman to be a president?

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,759
Ms. Xi.

134
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,879
This is Vita Design.

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480

You're...

151
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,160
So I prepared a surprise overnight.

152
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,279
It's waiting in your office.

153
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,079
Everyone, out.

154
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

155
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,000
You.

156
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,160
Stay.

157
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,480
Yan.

158
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,679
Why are you here today?

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
It's your first day.

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Of course I came to check on you.

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
But I didn't expect

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
Ms. Xi's office

163
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,720
to be full of temptation.

164
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,039
That brat, Dongfang Chen, set it up.

165
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,159
It has nothing to do with me.

166
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,039
Really?

167
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,879
Yeah.

168
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,200
Do I look like

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,159
a lustful pervert

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,799
who drools over people with good figure?

171
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,799
Qiao Xi!

172
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,759
Qiao Xi!

173
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,080
Don't even think about it.

174
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,279
Mr. Yan.

175
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,320
You two...

176
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,039
Settle it yourself.

177
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,279
Understood.

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,120
Qiao Xi.

179
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,360
I never realized

180
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,320
you were this capable.

181
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,960
You still call me Qiao Xi?

182
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,000
If not Qiao Xi,

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,679
should I call you

184
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,639
Dongfang Xi?

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,320
Didn't you get here

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,639
by seducing Dongfang Yan?

187
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,519
What?

188
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,759
Still dreaming of marrying
into the Dongfang family

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,759
and bearing their surname?

190
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
Gosh.

191
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,399
The pig head at the museum was fake.

192
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
The real one's here.

193
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,200
Qiao Xi!

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,159
You sold your body

195
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,080
and your beauty,

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
eager to be a mistress.

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
How did I not realize

198
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,919
you were so cheap before?

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,039
But

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,120
sooner or later,

201
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,480
Mr. Yan will dump you

202
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,399
when he's tired of you.

203
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,759
Qiao Xi!

204
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
Vita

205
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,320
will be designing
Ms. Dongfang's homecoming gown.

206
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,399
Once I win her favor,

207
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,360
you'll be kicked out of Vita.

208
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,919
(Jinghua Illusory House)

209
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,440
Ms. Dongfang will soon return home.

210
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,600
Dongfang Group

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,840
will hold a grand island party

212
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,679
and

213
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,600
choose Ms. Dongfang's fiancé.

214
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,840
Fiancé?

215
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
Marrying Ms. Dongfang

216
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,919
will be a direct route
to wealthy and glory.

217
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,360
Gosh.

218
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,440
I wish I could see
Ms. Dongfang's homecoming party.

219
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,759
Her gown

220
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,159
will be designed by Vita.

221
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,960
Mr. Yan ordered

222
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
no mistakes at all.

223
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,919
Vita's lead director,

224
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,799
Dong

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,240
and Yang Xiaoxin.

226
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,399
Both made designs.

227
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
I think

228
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,960
a woman's gown

229
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,639
should highlight

230
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,799
her sexy figure.

231
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,159
Deep V,

232
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,759
and bare back.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
It's guaranteed
that once Ms. Dongfang enters,

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
she'll outshine everyone.

235
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,440
Yang Xiaoxin.

236
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
What do you think?

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,879
I think

238
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,039
the Dongfang family is affluent.

239
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,559
She wouldn't want

240
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,960
to rely on showing her figure

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,200
to please men

242
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,200
or the public's gaze.

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,960
My idea is the exact opposite of Dong.

244
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
And

245
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,559
we need beauty and movement

246
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,399
on the island,

247
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,480
So...

248
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,559
What do you know?

249
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,240
Women wear gowns

250
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
just for others to see.

251
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,960
What beauty and movement?

252
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,879
Look at you.

253
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,360
Do you even exercise?

254
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,039
I...

255
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,720
Enough.

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
Pick out the fabrics.

257
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,360
Make sample gowns on the stop

258
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,799
for comparison.

259
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,600
Zhan?

260
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,759
Ms. Xi is so decisive.

261
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,639
You mean what you say.

262
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,080
Why are you here?

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
Our swim team needs new swimwear.

264
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,799
They said there's new fabric.

265
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,360
I came to check.

266
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,480
What is it?

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,000
Just go ahead.

268
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Ms. Xi.

269
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,039
I want to find a fabric

270
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,200
that shows a flow

271
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,879
like moving water.

272
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,159
Where's your new fabric?

273
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,580
In the display area.

274
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,840
Come, let's take a look.

275
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,039
(Qiao Xi.)

276
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,559
(Let's see
how you turn things around this time.)

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
(Liangxi Pond)
I found it.

278
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
