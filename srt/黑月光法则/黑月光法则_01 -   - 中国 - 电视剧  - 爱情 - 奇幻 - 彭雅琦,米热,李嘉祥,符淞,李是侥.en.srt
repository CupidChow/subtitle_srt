=Princess Revenge=

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,600
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:12,730
Have you ever thought

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:16,450
where the taken-over originals
go in transmigration novels?

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm that original.

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:20,889
I was a rich heiress

7
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:22,770
loved by everyone,

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,889
but a transmigrated girl took my body.

9
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,970
I watched her abandon my family,

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,729
cling to a poor man,

11
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,729
and give up wealth and status

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,170
to sell fish.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,770
Are you rushing to reincarnate?

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,649
Sorry.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,009
I'm in a hurry for work.

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:48,770
Qiao Xi!

17
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:54,969
Catching my boss's eye

18
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,009
is your blessing!

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,490
But I already have a boyfriend.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,450
You can't...

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,329
Your boyfriend

22
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,529
is just a skinny mutt.

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,809
Can he afford you?

24
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,530
How about this?

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,250
Take off one piece of clothing,

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,449
I'll give you 10,000 yuan.

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,690
Better than selling fish, right?

28
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,130
Take it off!

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,890
More than 10,000 yuan.

30
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:13,690
10,000 yuan each.

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,530
10,000 yuan each.

32
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:14,900
Take it off!

33
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,009
Take it off!

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,089
10,000 yuan each.

35
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:21,970
Take it off!

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,130
Take it off!

37
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,929
10,000 yuan each.

38
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:25,729
Take it off!

39
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:26,410
10,000 yuan each.

40
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,649
Take it off!

41
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:28,649
Take it off!

42
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,089
Don't take it off!

43
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,449
You took my body through transmigration.

44
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,410
It's alright
that you clung to a scumbag,

45
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,729
yet you now
sell yourself to support him.

46
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,530
I'd do anything

47
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,250
for Yunzhou.

48
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,490
But you're using my body.

49
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,530
It's mine now.

50
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,289
(Wait.)

51
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,649
(It's 10,000 yuan per piece.)

52
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,530
(Start with your socks.)

53
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,970
We found her.

54
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,650
Mr. Yan.

55
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,810
This is the contract to acquire

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,210
the country's only supercar line.

57
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:19,449
Once acquired,

58
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:20,609
Wang Group goes bankrupt.

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,889
Let it go bankrupt then.

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,810
Yes.

61
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,769
Mr. Yan, we found Ms. Dongfang.

62
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,530
Send me the address.

63
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,449
I'll fetch Xi.

64
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,810
(Zhan's the Best, Swim Forward)
Come on!

65
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,930
(2024 World Swim Championship)
Dongfang Zhan is 1st place!

66
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:54,449
Dongfang Zhan.

67
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,009
Everyone knows

68
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,609
the team's average age is 20.

69
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,970
You won the grand slam

70
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,329
at 23.

71
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,489
Do you think

72
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:01,970
it's superhuman willpower?

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,250
Superhuman doesn't need willpower.

74
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,410
All it takes is some brains to win.

75
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,769
You can try it too

76
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,810
if you have brains.

77
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:09,530
You...

78
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,970
Zhan, we found Ms. Dongfang.

79
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,609
Your gold medal...

80
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,530
It's nothing compared to my sister.

81
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,850
Dongfang Chen.

82
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,130
I love you!

83
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,329
Every goodbye

84
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,250
is a beautiful hope.

85
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,930
I hope for our next meeting.

86
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,090
One more!

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,090
Chen, we found Ms. Dongfang.

88
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,970
Quick, bring my car.

89
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,850
Let's pick her up.

90
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,729
This fish-selling girl...

91
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:05,250
Jeez.

92
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:05,990
She actually stripped.

93
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,489
Yeah.

94
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:13,930
No.

95
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,169
You only took off your socks?

96
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:16,500
Are you kidding me?

97
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,689
(Dongfang Xi.)

98
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,129
(Look at how your idea turn out.)

99
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,210
You said it just now.

100
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,609
This body is yours now.

101
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,770
Yan?

102
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,809
Boss.

103
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,210
Boss.

104
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,169
Boss.

105
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,689
Yan!

106
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:47,929
Get lost!

107
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,770
Let's go.

108
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,369
I knew it.

109
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,090
Someone came to rescue her.

110
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:14,850
Yan.

111
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:16,770
Zhan, Chen.

112
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,929
How did you find me?

113
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,129
You left home

114
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,210
just to sell fish here?

115
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,090
You lowered yourself to sell fish?

116
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,890
He made you do this.

117
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,450
Dongfang Xi!

118
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,410
Don't call me that.

119
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,410
I'm Qiao Xi now.

120
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,570
Ye Yunzhou's only Qiao Xi.

121
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,729
Nonsense.

122
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:34,450
Come home with me.

123
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,489
No.

124
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,770
Why not?

125
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,049
In life,

126
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,090
you meet 29.2 million people.

127
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,850
The chance two fall in love is 0.00049.

128
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,489
My love with Yunzhou

129
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,010
is already a miracle.

130
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,970
I'm even willing to beg with him.

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,049
What nonsense.

132
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,970
If you really like selling fish

133
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,850
or begging,

134
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,970
I'll buy you a whole street,

135
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,410
do as you like.

136
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:01,650
How vulgar.

137
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,090
Don't insult my love with money.

138
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,850
True feelings outweigh money.

139
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,570
Love changed you completely.

140
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,210
If not for your face,

141
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,809
I'd doubt you're my sister.

142
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,570
I haven't changed.

143
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,369
I just found life's meaning.

144
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,729
Yunzhou and I

145
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:25,970
met in the vast world and fell in love.

146
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,289
I won't leave him.

147
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,049
It's not up to you.

148
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,590
What are you doing?

149
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:45,369
Either you go home

150
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,850
or take my corpse back.

151
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,010
For his pathetic pride,

152
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,210
you changed your name, hid your past,

153
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,770
and gave up wealth and status.

154
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:54,929
Are you sure

155
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,729
he'd give up everything for you too?

156
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:57,570
I'm sure.

157
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,129
I love him.

158
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,090
He loves me too.

159
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:06,609
Fine.

160
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:09,970
(Don't go!)

161
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,850
(Don't go! That wasn't me!)

162
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:14,809
Don't go!

163
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,410
That wasn't me!

164
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,609
Don't go!

165
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,729
Save your strength.

166
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,410
They can't hear you.

167
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,489
I'm the transmigrator.

168
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,249
You can't beat me.

169
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,530
You occupied my body for three years

170
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,809
and kept me from home

171
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,210
just to date that poor man?

172
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:32,929
Yes.

173
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,169
I transmigrated

174
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,770
only to love Yunzhou.

175
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,249
Yan and Zhan

176
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,970
are only
the Dongfang family's adopted sons.

177
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,650
Chen is just a pretty boy.

178
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,890
Only Yunzhou

179
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,489
is a real treasure.

180
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,210
I want to be the heroine of his life.

181
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,450
When I take back my body,

182
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,049
none of you will have peace.

183
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,530
Unless I die,

184
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,530
you'll never return.

185
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,049
Yan.

186
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,330
How about we knock Xi out?

187
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,850
Is your head just for display?

188
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,890
Go home first.

189
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,210
Mr. Yan.

190
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,650
Find Ye Yunzhou.

191
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,450
Find him a small company

192
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,330
under the group

193
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,249
and promise him a management position.

194
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,570
Need any conditions from him?

195
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:32,570
No.

196
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,050
Yes.

197
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,649
(The greedy always abandon)

198
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,529
(what they think is a burden.)

199
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,729
(Xi.)

200
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,009
(I hope you see reality soon.)

201
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,409
Yunzhou.

202
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,489
Shouldn't you be at Wang Group

203
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,050
working?

204
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,369
Qiao Xi.

205
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,850
You really are a jinx.

206
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,170
Since being with you,

207
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,210
three companies
I worked at went bankrupt.

208
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,489
This time it's Wang Group.

209
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,810
It's a century-old group.

210
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,529
Even it went bankrupt overnight.

211
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,210
(Could this be my brothers' trick)

212
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,290
(to force me back?)

213
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,529
Yunzhou.

214
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,529
Don't touch me!

215
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,889
Yunzhou.

216
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,369
You once saved me

217
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,290
and never looked down on me.

218
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,009
But now...

219
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,850
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,210
I'm sorry, Yunzhou.

221
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,649
I shouldn't have said that.

222
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,450
It's good that you're sorry.

223
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,609
While I rest,

224
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,810
this fish stall

225
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,609
is our family's only income.

226
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,170
I understand.

227
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,409
I'll work hard

228
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,009
for our future.

229
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,210
(Ye's Fish Stall)
This is Ye Yunzhou.

230
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,369
You're the president's secretary
from Dongfang Group?

231
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,369
I'll come immediately.

232
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,489
Yunzhou, congratulations.

233
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,050
You're now vice president

234
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,850
of Vita, under Dongfang Group.

235
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,290
This is your appointment letter.

236
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,812
(Dongfang Group)

237
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:38,091
Mr. Yan personally arranged it.

238
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,729
What?

239
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,050
Perhaps your skills

240
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,450
caught Mr. Yan's attention.

241
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,330
That's why we hold an appointment banquet

242
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,529
for you today.

243
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,649
You may invite your family

244
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,050
or your girlfriend.

245
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,489
Zhitao.

246
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,129
Actually, I'm still single.

247
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,170
Since graduation,

248
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,409
I've never forgotten you.

249
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,930
Let's go inside first.

250
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,050
Yunting.

251
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,009
Are you done?

252
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,290
We'll leave once you're ready.

253
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,170
These...

254
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,210
These are all mine.

255
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,210
Qiao Xi,

256
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,609
you've been kicked out.

257
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:25,729
Get lost.

258
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,609
What?

259
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:28,850
Why?

260
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,409
My brother

261
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,369
now works for Dongfang Group.

262
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:33,810
You're not his match.

263
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,450
That's great.

264
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,729
I knew our Yunzhou...

265
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,369
He's not yours!

266
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,210
My sister-in-law

267
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,129
is the president's secretary
of Dongfang Group.

268
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,810
You're just a fish seller.

269
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,889
Dongfang Group?

270
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,210
Well...

271
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,450
I can also...

272
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,609
Qiao Xi.

273
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,050
I know exactly

274
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:53,769
what you're worth.

275
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,090
With your penniless look,

276
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:56,690
who could you know?

277
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,009
Besides,

278
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,850
my sister-in-law

279
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,889
is my brother's

280
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,090
true love and first love.

281
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,810
Yunzhou's

282
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:06,609
first love?

283
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:08,970
Then,

284
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:10,249
what am I?

285
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,129
What are you?

286
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,970
You're just our maid.

287
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:15,649
Go.

288
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:16,450
Come on.

289
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,090
Let's go.

290
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:34,729
No.

291
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,609
Let me see Yunzhou!

292
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,210
Yunzhou loves me.

293
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,649
Mr. Ye.

294
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,570
Congratulations, Mr. Ye.

295
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,009
You're so young.

296
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,769
Do look after us.

297
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,649
Yunzhou.

298
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,649
Zhitao.

299
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,570
My happiest thing today

300
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,409
is not becoming vice president

301
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,649
but meeting you again.

302
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:24,529
I missed you so much.

303
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:31,170
Sorry.

304
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,009
Seeing the one I longed for again,

305
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,850
I got too excited.

306
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:38,810
It's okay.

307
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:46,970
Yunzhou.

308
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,609
Qiao Xi is really shameless.

309
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:50,210
She followed our car here.

310
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,450
I'll come right away.

311
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,170
Zhitao.

312
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,409
Let me handle a small matter.

313
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,690
I'll be back soon.

314
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,570
Mom!

315
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:10,249
Mom.

316
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:11,369
What mom?

317
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,649
Give up already.

318
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,489
Yunzhou.

319
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,850
Who are you
to dream of being with my brother?

320
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:31,769
Yunzhou.

321
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,009
Yunzhou.

322
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,690
I've done so much for you.

323
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,170
You have to love me.

324
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,609
Qiao Xi.

325
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,649
I never loved you.

326
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,090
I'm in pain.

327
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,129
Yunzhou.

328
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:12,129
Yunzhou.

329
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,450
(Unless I die,)

330
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,489
