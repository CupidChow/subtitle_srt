Doctor.

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
Doctor, how is she?

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,039
How is she?

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,800
Ms. Dongfang has no vital signs
at the moment.

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
Even if we resuscitate her,
the chances of her waking up are slim.

32
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,960
That can't be true!

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Say that again and I'll…

34
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,240
Control yourself.

35
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Calm down.

36
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,319
Doctor,

37
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,280
you'll have every medical resource
we can get you.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,840
Just save her, please.

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,599
Promise me.

40
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,879
If you can't save my sister,
you can say goodbye to your jobs!

41
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:27,919
Yan.

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,159
Yan.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,960
Did I die?

44
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,600
(Lock down the entire track,
search every corner!)

45
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,023
(No one leaves!)

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,400
(If you can't save my sister,
you can say goodbye to your jobs!)

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,159
Why am I back here again?

48
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,639
Am I going lovesick and crazy again?

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,719
Or are you planning to lock me up?

50
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,719
(It's not confinement.)

51
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,680
(It's punishment.)

52
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,879
Who in the world are you?

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I heard your voice

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,759
right before I crashed.

55
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,919
(I'm the system of the novel
"Addicted to Toxic Love.")

56
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,680
(My job is to make sure
the story runs according to plot.)

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,680
System?

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,719
(Because the character Dongfang Xi)

59
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,520
(veered off the role
of the vicious supporting actress,)

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
(a traveler was sent three years ago
to correct the storyline.)

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
I came here

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,399
to be with Yunzhou.

63
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,800
I want to be the heroine of his life.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,930
So just because I'm the "villainess",

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,560
I'm supposed to obsess
over the male lead like a stalker?

66
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
Scheme against the heroine
with cheap tricks?

67
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,800
Make a fool of myself,

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,079
just so the leads can prove their love?

69
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Correct.

70
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,279
And what about my own life,

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,399
my own choices?

72
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,879
Your life means nothing.

73
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,079
Only your mission matters.

74
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,319
Absolutely not!

75
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,680
This time,

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,959
you're going to die.

77
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,639
That's the price of going off-script.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
How is that even possible?

79
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,959
For this trashy, over-the-top plot,

80
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,199
I was trapped for three whole years,

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,199
watching someone else take my place.

82
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
I finally came back,

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
cleaned up the mess left
by that so-called traveler,

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,199
and now you're telling me I have
to step aside for the "real" heroine?

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
Is that not ridiculous?

86
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,519
I am unable to comprehend this.

87
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,519
The system only advances the plot.

88
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,000
It doesn't understand or feel emotions.

89
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,680
I just want to live.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
System,

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
you can't kill me, can you?

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
What do you mean?

93
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,839
If you can kill me, then do it now.

94
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,399
Three.

95
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,199
Two.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,360
One.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,279
Looks like I was right.

98
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,399
If you could,
you'd have killed me already

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,439
instead of wasting time talking.

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
The novel hasn't reached
your ending yet.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
The system can't kill
a character outright.

102
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,040
It can only warn you.

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,639
I knew it.

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,279
Xi!

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm glad you're back.

106
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,759
(According to the novel,)

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
(my family will abandon me.)

108
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,600
(They'll despise me.)

109
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,319
Yan, no,

110
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,279
Dongfang Yan,

111
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,120
will you drift further
and further away from me?

112
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,959
As long as you don't change,

113
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,920
I'll never change either.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Xi.

115
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,512
(Three Days Later)

116
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Since Xi got back from the hospital,

117
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
she's been shutting herself in her room.

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,839
She won't talk or see anyone.

119
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,519
Do you think she might've hit her head

120
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
in that crash and lost it?

121
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,360
Relax.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,519
Your stupidity hasn't gone away.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,199
Xi won't let herself lose it either.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
What's wrong?

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
Did you cry?

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,399
The doctor said you're fine

127
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,199
aside from a fractured leg.

128
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,360
You don't need to act like
it's the end of the world.

129
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,839
Li Tingchen was too cruel…

130
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,560
He drained the blood of his true love

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,199
to save another woman…

132
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,519
That's ridiculous!

133
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,240
Who's Li Tingchen?

134
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,120
He dared to pull that on you?

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
He wants to drain your blood?

136
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,279
Later, he found out the truth.
Realized that

137
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,279
for eight years,

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,799
he'd loved the wrong person.

139
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,320
But then he lost his memory
in a car crash…

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Where is this man?

141
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
I'll go find him.

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,399
Go ahead.

143
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:47,960
Where is he?

144
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
("The Substitute Bride: CEO's Obsession")
In "The Substitute Bride: CEO's Obsession".

145
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,960
Dongfang Xi,

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,279
so this is why you've been
holed up for days,

147
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,639
staying up sleepless
and glued to this nonsense?

148
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,840
What kind of garbage are you reading?

149
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,320
What do you know!

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,159
Yang Xiaoxin recommended it.
It's a classic from way back.

151
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,039
These are the new arrivals.

152
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,919
We've got reincarnation,

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,440
yandere,

154
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799
younger guy,

155
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,120
coming-of-age,

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
everything.

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,559
As well as…

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
Buy them.

159
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
I want all of them.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,120
Ms. Xi.

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,759
Just call me Xi,

162
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,960
like my family does.

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,399
Okay.

164
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,399
Why would you suddenly start
reading these novels?

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
Know yourself, know your enemy.

166
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,679
That's the only way to win.

167
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I need to figure out

168
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,799
these story patterns

169
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,919
if I want to defeat it.

170
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,759
Oh, okay…

171
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,440
I already finished the stack of novels
you gave me last time.

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,039
I've only got one question.

173
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,120
Say there's this girl,

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
she's from a rich family,

175
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,679
perfect home,

176
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,360
she's smart, brave,

177
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,480
beautiful, talented.

178
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,639
Men are never an issue for her…

179
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,080
Classic "supporting villainess" setup.

180
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,399
But why?

181
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,120
Why is she labeled the villainess?

182
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,240
Because the heroine

183
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,440
only needs to be kind. That's it.

184
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,240
Extra points if she's poor,

185
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,559
ordinary,

186
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,159
but resilient.

187
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,037
(Ye's Fish Stall)

188
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,360
Even better if she's an orphan

189
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,759
with a rare blood type,

190
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,960
gets kidnapped by the CEO,

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,080
and used as a walking blood bank.

192
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
If she's being drained on the regular,

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,440
she'd be the model heroine.

194
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,970
By that standard,
she really is the perfect heroine.

195
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,080
And the CEO.

196
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,440
Cold to everyone

197
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
without exception.

198
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,279
The abstinent type.

199
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,360
And

200
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
he barely even notices
the heroine exists.

201
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,639
In fact, he fires her,

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,720
and her life
completely falls apart because of it.

203
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,480
How do two people like that
even fall in love?

204
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,600
You don't get it.

205
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,519
That's called toxic love.

206
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,879
Two people from different worlds

207
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,960
have a one-night stand,

208
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,799
then she gets pregnant,
begins a runaway arc,

209
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,759
and eventually the guy
chases her down, groveling.

210
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,720
Runaway with the baby?

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,279
Yes.

212
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,600
Tuantuan, did you have fun today?

213
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,879
I did.

214
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,519
Tuantuan!

215
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,480
Mom's here.

216
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,519
Mom!

217
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,759
Tuantuan, did you have fun today?

218
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,639
I did.

219
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,759
Tuantuan, come on, call Auntie.

220
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
Auntie.

221
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,240
(Oh my goodness!)

222
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,559
(That exact scene
was in "Addicted to Toxic Love.")

223
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,279
(Bai Zhitao begs Dongfang Yan
to spare Ye Yunzhou.)

224
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,399
(She sacrifices herself,)

225
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,720
(and with one time she gets pregnant.)

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,240
(That's when the runaway-with-baby,
you-chase-I-flee storyline begins.)

227
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,279
I'm not letting that happen!

228
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,840
Driver,

229
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,960
pick me up right now.
Take me to Dongfang Group.

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,519
It's a medical miracle!

231
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
You keep targeting Yunzhou.

232
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,360
We're completely backed
into a corner now.

233
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,159
He brought that on himself.

234
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
All I asked
was for Ms. Dongfang to apologize.

235
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,720
But she got him fired

236
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,799
and humiliated him in front of everyone.

237
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,159
Yunzhou isn't that kind of man…

238
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,799
Mr. Yan…

239
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,960
You drugged me?

240
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,399
No, I didn't!

241
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
But if that's what it takes for you
to let us go…

242
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,039
My heart only belongs to Yunzhou.

243
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,399
Then stop taking off your clothes!

244
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,440
Ms. Dongfang!

245
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,159
What do you think you're doing,

246
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,399
offering yourself up as a trade?

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,279
I don't have a choice.

248
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,960
Get out!

249
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,519
Does the author seriously not
have any better ideas?

250
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,919
Dongfang Yan just happened
to get drugged.

251
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,799
Bai Zhitao just happened
to show up and plead her case.

252
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,399
And somehow,
they just happened to have a kid.

253
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,990
Are we really expected
to accept this absurd plot?

254
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,720
They don't respect men,

255
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
women,

256
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,279
or the reader's intelligence at all.

257
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,080
Dongfang Yan.

258
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,159
Xi.

259
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,039
Leave.

260
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,159
Do you want me to leave or not?

261
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,360
Xi.

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,600
Hey, don't…

263
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,000
(You drove Bai Zhitao away.)

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,159
(But someone has
to fill in the gaps in the story.)

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,840
Xi…

266
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm still recovering!

267
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,519
