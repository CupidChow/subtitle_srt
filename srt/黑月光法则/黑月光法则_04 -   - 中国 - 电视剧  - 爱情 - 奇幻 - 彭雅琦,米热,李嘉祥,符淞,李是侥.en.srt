=Episode 4=

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,719
(I'll snatch away
your fabric and design.)

8
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,240
(Let's see what else you, Qiao Xi,
have left to fight me with.)

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,759
(When the time comes, the one thrown out
of Dongfang Group will definitely be you.)

10
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,840
Xiaoxin, are you alright?

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,159
I... I'm fine, Ms. Xi.

12
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,799
How about you?

13
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm fine.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
The competition is about to start.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
You'd better hurry over.

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,159
No, what about you?

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Don't be so sad.

18
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,560
The competition isn't over yet.

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,519
You don't want that Dong to win, do you?

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,159
Then focus on your own work.

21
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,200
Go compete quickly.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,680
There are plenty of people

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,760
lining up to save me.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,319
Alright.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
Go.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,439
Good thing I was in line to save you.

27
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,000
I made it in time.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Time's up.

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
Sorry about that.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,199
My hand slipped.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,879
This is my design.

32
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,080
The gown emphasizes elegance
and classic style,

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,439
with the addition of a special fabric

34
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,520
that is both slimming and flowing.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
For Ms. Dongfang's island banquet,

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,879
it couldn't be more suitable.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,879
Not bad.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,360
You...

39
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,479
You plagiarized my idea!

40
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,840
I finished mine first.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Who copied whom,

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
is still uncertain.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,000
I...

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,719
Yang Xiaoxin.

45
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,759
Where's your work?

46
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,560
I haven't finished yet.

47
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,520
The time isn't up.

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,319
Don't give me useless excuses.

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
Without a completed piece,

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,960
you have no qualification
to compete at all.

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,759
In that case,

52
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,439
I announce

53
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,199
that for this Dongfang Group's
Homecoming Banquet,

54
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,560
the gown's designer

55
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,280
will be Dong.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Wait!

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Ms. Xi.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,199
If you're unwell, go to the hospital.

59
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,639
This competition is already decided.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,199
Already decided?

61
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,039
Since it was
an unfair competition to begin with,

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
then let it be unfair to the end.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,680
Now, as the President of Vita,
I announce

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,919
that the gown's designer

65
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,919
will be Yang Xiaoxin.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,599
Who are you to make choices
in place of Ms. Dongfang?

67
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,919
If Ms. Dongfang finds out,

68
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,960
she'll throw you out
of Vita immediately.

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,479
And what are you supposed to be?

70
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,439
He's the sec...

71
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:52,960
Who is this man?

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,719
Isn't he that...

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,120
Ms. Xi, from the Dongfang family?

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,479
What's wrong?

75
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,680
Ms. Xi has a fever.

76
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,960
Come on.

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,639
To the hospital.

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,919
Wait.

79
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,800
Who said you could leave?

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,360
Get lost!

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
Put me down.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,720
No.

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
Put me down

84
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,519
and beat up these two idiots.

85
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,639
Why aren't you stopping her?

86
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,040
Stop!

87
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,720
Oh my god.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
I... I've trained
in karate for eight years.

89
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,720
Dong.

90
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,839
Women can fight too.

91
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,279
The third young master
of the Dongfang family.

92
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,079
He is Dongfang Chen.

93
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Mr. Yan is here too.

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,199
I'm here.

95
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,560
Take her to the car.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,160
Alright.

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,759
Oh no.

98
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,240
The Dongfang family has arrived.

99
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,680
What's going on?

100
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Qiao Xi.

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,990
She ruined the fairness
of the competition

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
and even made decisions
for Ms. Dongfang.

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
For Ms. Dongfang?

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,759
Yes.

105
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,480
How dare she...

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,160
It was my little sister's decision.

107
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,199
Do you object?

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,839
Didn't I say our Xiaoxin had potential?

109
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,839
No wonder she's a talent I discovered.

110
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,639
No...

111
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,000
There's no need to exaggerate.

112
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,800
Right?

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,560
No...

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
This employee of mine is simply humble.

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,680
No...

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,120
It's not...

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,879
I... It's not...

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,839
It's alright.

119
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,560
What belongs to you,

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll fight for on your behalf.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't worry.

122
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,040
Designer Dong

123
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,279
not only plagiarized

124
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,199
but also ignored the competition rules.

125
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,560
Now,

126
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,560
I dismiss him on the spot.

127
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,399
From now on,
no design company will dare to take him.

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,319
What happened today

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,600
is exactly as I've said.

130
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,519
I don't want to hear a second version.

131
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
Especially you.

132
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,560
If you dare speak out,

133
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,920
even Qiao Xi won't be able
to protect you.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
Yan,

135
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
you let that man off so easily?

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,879
He is Ye Yunzhou.

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Ye Yunzhou?

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
That's Ye Yunzhou.

139
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,519
That rotten scumbag.

140
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,390
I'll beat him until
even his own mother won't recognise him.

141
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,759
As for Xiaoxi's matters,

142
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,120
let her handle them herself.

143
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,439
No matter what she thinks.

144
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,000
She has us backing her up anyway.

145
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,680
(Vita)
Congratulations, Xiaoxin.

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,439
You get to design
the gown for the young lady.

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,399
Oh right,

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
because of you,

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Mr. Ye even received

150
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,900
an invitation to the Dongfang family's
Homecoming Banquet.

151
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
Ye Yunzhou didn't get the invitation

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,199
because of Xiaoxin.

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,040
He

154
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,399
buttering up Mr. Yan's assistant.

155
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,160
What?

156
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,199
Thank you for giving me the invitation,

157
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Zhitao.

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,959
All these years,

159
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,399
you've always been in my heart.

160
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,079
Yunzhou.

161
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,920
I never thought
you still had me in your heart.

162
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,079
But you and Qiao Xi already...

163
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Back then, I trusted the wrong person.

164
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,000
After I got together with Qiao Xi,

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,480
she started flirting with Mr. Yan,

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,439
and now she's even close to Mr. Zhan.

167
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,959
I've been hurt too many times

168
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,320
because of that woman.

169
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,440
I don't want her to hurt you again.

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Yunzhou.

171
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,320
My heart aches for you.

172
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,480
Don't rush.

173
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,639
Here they come.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
Hello.

175
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,559
(Dongfang Group)
Could you say a few words?

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
Can you tell us

177
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,759
about Ms. Dongfang's condition?

178
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,720
How is she now?

179
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,639
For her homecoming today,
are there any special arrangements?

180
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,720
Could you give us a hint?

181
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Hello.

182
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,399
For this banquet,
photography, video, and audio recordings

183
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,770
are strictly forbidden. We'll temporarily
hold your electronic devices.

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,480
After all, this is the Dongfang family.

185
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,960
Hand it over.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,519
Ms. Bai.

187
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,519
It's fine, I'll handle it.

188
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,559
Yunzhou.

189
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,759
