So I went along and pretended like he was Heo Chi Yeong.

184
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,980
They'll be divorced soon.

185

He said he'd wrap up everything and come to me.

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,380
Their marriage was for show, anyway.

187
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,500
It's better to end it before they get more miserable.

188
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,960

189
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240

Isn't this good for you, too?

191
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,120

Thank you. Come again.

Was it really Seo Jae Won?

198
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,670
Yes. It was.

In person, she looked so-

205
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,810
Not that. Could you tell me more about her hand injury?

207
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,330

They said they can do it as quietly as possible.

209

If everything you've said is true,

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,230
it won't be too difficult even if we end up with a lawsuit.

The husband is at fault for divorce, too.

212

And you contribute significantly more to the combined assets.

213
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,650
We'll provide as much proof as possible.

214
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,970
How about the custody?

215
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,250
Is he not willing to negotiate at all?

216
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,700
According to the show, it seems he's mostly in charge of raising the child.

217
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,010
I said he has another woman.

218
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,550
Custody is a bit different.

219
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,950
If one person is closer to the child by putting more effort into parenting

220
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,810
and if they prove they can provide a better environment for the child,

221
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,770
the liable spouse can end up with the custody, too.

222
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,510
Yes, Ms. Seo.

But why don't you consider getting her transferred?

363
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Do you really think this is my daughter's fault?

364
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,410
I don't think so at all.

365
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,990
My daughter didn't do anything wrong.

366
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,430
The real problem is the people who treat a sick child like a criminal.

367
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,200
Let me try it once, too.

368
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,330
We're just goofing around.

369
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,690
I'll make it quick.

370
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,430
You bastards! What are you doing in there?

371
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,780
Ahjussi.

372
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,920
I...

373
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,060
don't want to go to the hospital.

374
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,210
You don't...

375
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,350
have to go to the hospital.

376
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,090
Really?

377
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,950
You'll transfer to a different school, too.

378
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,920
Let's change your name and

379
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,060
live somewhere no one knows about it.

380
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,170
No one would know if you take the meds regularly.

381
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,450
So from now on, we'll keep your illness

382
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,910
a secret between you and me.

383
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,120
You can't tell anyone about it from now on.

384
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,870
You can do that, right?

385
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,380
And Yoon Jin.

386
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,050
Don't worry.

387
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,690
I'll make money and make sure to get rid of the wound on your arm.

388
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,180
Let's go.

389
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,340
What will poor Jae Won do?

390
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,310
It's my fault.

391
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,090
Jae Won...

392
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,220
Enjoy.

393
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,970
Did you finish the mural for Dereve?

394
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,700
Not yet.

395
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,990
How long will you cling to that?

396
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,970
I told Director Kim at Won Gallery about you.

397
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,960
Stop by there sometime.

398
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,300
I can take care of myself.

399
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,520
What do you do, exactly?

400
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,560
You've been unknown forever, and you never won any award.

401
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,710
You need to have an exhibition before you get hired as a full-time professor.

402
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,250
I'll still be a professor at a college outside of Seoul.

403
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,420
Are you even satisfied with that?

404
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,730
What can I do?

405
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,040
It's not like you're capable like Jae Won.

406
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,980
- Father.
- You've been stubborn for 20 years. It's time to get it together.

407
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,720
You can't keep doing whatever you want.

408
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,380
There's someone I want to marry.

409
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,350
- What?
- I'll introduce him to you formally soon. Look forward to it.

410
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,410
You'll have a very sweet grandchild, too.

411
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,150
Give it to me, Father. I'll do it.

412
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,390
Gosh, you're making your guest feel uncomfortable. What's with you?

413
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,280
I just want to wash the bowl I used.

414
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,570
Guest? You're hurting my feelings.

415
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,290
Give it to me. I want to do it. Please.

416
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,180
Geez. Okay.

417
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,180
- Father, is there anything you'd like to eat?
-No.

418
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,500
How about saury and soju with dinner later?

419
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,320
Sounds good.

420
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,060
- Saury it is.
- Okay.

421
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,650
Aigoo, it's Princess Ah Rin.

422
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,630
Are you ready? Wait a moment. I'll drive you soon.

423
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,870
I refuse.

424
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,270
I'll go with Grandpa today.

425
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,780
Really?

426
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,010
Go with Grandpa, then.

427
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:01,650
Heo Ah Rin. Watch out for cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and scooters. You know, right?

428
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,410
I know already.

429
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,010
I'm not a baby, okay?

430
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,150
Wow.

431
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,330
- Let's go.
- See you!

432
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,720
Hey, hold on.

433
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,690
Are you not ready yet?

434
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,710
Are you not done thinking yet?

435
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,250
Don't provoke me.

436
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm holding back with all my might.

437
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,460
Just let me raise Ah Rin.

438
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,550
I don't need anything else. I don't want any of your money.

439
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,960
Just let me raise her.

440
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,190
That's not going to happen.

441
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,690
An ant!

442
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,560
The animal has changed.

443
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,890
Push this. Swoosh!

444
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,180
This is...

445
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,000
Team Leader Yoon.

446
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,320
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

447
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,680
Are you here to check it out before the meeting?

448
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,660
Furniture with minimal design has been popular...

449
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,070
This design is also...

450
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,130
Are you okay, Ms. Seo?

451
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,520
Ms. Seo.

452
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,390
What's wrong?

453
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,110
Are you in pain?

454
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,910
No, I'm okay.

455
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,910
I just got startled.

456
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,100
What's wrong, Ms. Seo?

457
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,800
- Give me 10 minutes.
- Pardon?

458
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,600
There's something I want to check.

459
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Wait for me in the car.

460
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,180
What are you doing here?

461
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,620
How about you?

462
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,270
You...

463
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,700
I said I don't need anything here.

464
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,970
I'm sorry.

465
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,440
Excuse me.

466
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,980
I'm sorry, but could you get me water?

467
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,430
Sure.

468
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,410
Here you go.

469
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,080
Thank you.

470
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,350
CEO Seo.

471
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,980
Congratulations.

472
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,260
Hello, Mr. Kwon.

473
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,080
There are so many reporters outside.

474
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,320
Everyone is excited since this is your first public event.

475
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,670
Yes.

476
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,520
What's wrong? Are you feeling ill?

477
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,620
No, no...

478
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm sorry. I made a mistake earlier.

479
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,590
I guess something fell.

480
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,010
Let's go out. You should say hello before the event.

481
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,560
- Yes.
- Let's go.

482
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,810
Thank you for earlier.

483
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,070
What did you do with the pills?

484
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,740
I threw them away.

485
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,380
No one saw it. I had them in my pocket.

486
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,840
It's a lot of pills for one dose.

487
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,980
D-Do you know what they are?

488
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,300
Yes.

489
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,130
I've been keeping it a secret from my friends and family all my life.

490
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,510
But I got caught by a stranger today.

491
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,930
It's not a big deal.

492
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,840
It's like a cold that...

493
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,630
anyone can catch, it turns out.

494
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,690
Thank you.

495
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,790
You're the first person who said that to me.

496
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,680
Are you an art student?

497
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,850
How did you know?

498
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,860
It's hard to get rid of the paint smell.

499
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,070
Can you smell the paint?

500
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,250
Only the ones who majored in painting would notice.

501
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,260
I didn't know you painted.

502
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,560
Oh, I used to. Not anymore.

503
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,930
I doubted I could make a living with it. So, I quit early.

504
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,340
That's too much information.

505
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:22,590
I-It's because I'm a bit nervous. Just disregard it.

506
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,840
Those pills.

507
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,230
I've taken them, too.

508
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,450
I went to middle school and high school in the US.

509
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,970
I was bullied a lot since there were no Asians there.

510
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,620
I thought running away meant I lost.

511
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,810
So I endured with all my might.

512
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,640
But I guess my heart couldn't keep up.

513
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,540
So I took medicine and got treated.

514
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,850
I started painting then when I went through therapy.

515
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,090
It's not fair to feel exposed alone.

516
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,860
I need to get going.

517
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,770
Thank you.

518
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,030
I feel a lot better thanks to you.

519
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,280
I'll return the favor if I see you next time.

520
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,440
Next time...

521
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,690
You promised this time.

522
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,100
♫ Why would it happen? ♫

523
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,940
♫ Like how it all has been... ♫

524
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,250
Why didn't you tell me?

525
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,900
What could I say to someone who doesn't even remember?

526
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,340
And what would you have said if I told you?

527
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,820
"Did that happen?

528
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,810
But it was nothing."

529
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,300
If you said that,

530
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,950
my memory would've felt insignificant.

531
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,730
Te Oh.

532
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,180
I thought it'd be over if I turned around and forgot.

533
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,120
But it didn't go that way.

534
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,610
I kept wondering how you were

535
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,110
and I wanted to see you one more time.

536
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,250
I'm Dereve's Seo Jae Won.

537
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,740
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

538
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,490
♫ The ending was paused by the truth ♫

539
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,420
♫ Back then, we... ♫

540
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,330
Theo Harris? Or should I call you by your Korean name, Yoon Te Oh?

541
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,180
I...

542
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,160
I need to get going.

♫ I wanna know ♫

544
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,610
♫ I'm not okay. I can feel your touch. ♫

545
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,410
♫ A huge wave of memories are coming in ♫

00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,160
Could you give me this name tag?
[Seo Yoon Jin]

549
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,640
Why do you want this?

550
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,950
I feel like I should keep it.

551
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,470
♫ I'm left alone in the darkness ♫

552
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,330
♫ Looking for you, the light. Lost in the dream. ♫

553

♫ I'm left alone in the darkness. Looking for you. ♫

554

Conference...

555
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,050
That's enough, I said. Please.

556
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,890
Did you take the medicine today?

557
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,850
That medicine. You didn't take the headache medicine, did you?

558
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:57,910
♫ I can hear your voice. I picture us seeing each other in my dream. ♫

559
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,710
Ms. Seo.

560
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,360
Ms. Kwon thinks she can finish the mural this week.

561
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,530
How should I proceed with the unveiling ceremony?

562
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,310
Just one second.

563
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,050
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,410
When you came by last time without knowing Ah Rin was absent,

565
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,250
you asked me to call you even if something small happens.

566
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,640
Well, the thing is...

567
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,190
It's okay. Just tell me.

568
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,900
A lady came by the kindergarten to meet Ah Rin earlier today.

569
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,640
She told us she'll be marrying Ah Rin's father.

570
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:56,530
She said she came to say hello since she might be dropping off and picking up Ah Rin from now on.

571
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,660
Does my husband know, too?

572
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,960
Does he know she came by here?

573
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,610
I assume he does.

574
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,170
Ah Rin's old teacher has met her, too.

575
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:20,060
Ah Rin's father apparently asked her to drop off the school supplies.

576
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,410
Even if our marriage ends,

577
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,660
I hoped to be a good mother to Ah Rin.

578
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,270
If I can't even do that,

579
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,210
I no longer...

580
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,780
Mr. Nam Tae Joo. Where are you right now?

581
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,550
Are you sure you won't regret this?

582
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:56,130
Mr. Baek Seung Gyu invested in stocks, crypto, and everything.

583
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,000
All of his accounts were overdrawn.

584
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
He had a student loan, and he had a lot of debt, too.

585
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,630
But he lost a lot in investment, too.

586
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,690
Why would he want to live?

587
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,340
Do you mean he jumped on his own?

588
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,520
We found no evidence. No evidence.

589
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,640
There was no sign of resistance at the scene

590
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,050
and he got rid of his belongings before he fell, too.

591
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,820
You know the apartment he lived in? He put it on the market himself.

592
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,440
Did you check the CCTV?

593
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,250
Geez. It didn't record that day.

594
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,450
It didn't record?

595
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,120
It's always like that.

596
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,790
Why did it not record only that day?

597
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,110
I wouldn't know why.

598
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:39,190
Is it because it's an old model? Geez.

599
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,200
How about his phone?

600
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,240
I didn't find much on his phone, either.

601
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,760
You checked everything?

602
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,550
Of course, we did.

603
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,160
- Detective Lee.
- Yeah?

604
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,050
- Chief wants to see you.
- Oh, okay.

605
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,030
Take care, then.

606
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,860
Yes. A team leader from the company stopped by.

607
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,670
Yes. He doesn't seem to be accepting it well,

608
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,420
but there's no evidence. What can he do?

609
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,520
The geezer didn't say much, either?

610
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,180
No. The higher-ups aren't saying anything. I think the case will close now.

611
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,410
Okay. Thank you.

612
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,490
Yes. Take care.

613
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,970
Shit...

614
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,960
Look who we got here.

615
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,610
It's likely to be concluded as a suicide due to financial struggle.

616
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,260
How about the CCTV?

617
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,510
It's been taken care of.

618
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,280
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

619
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,600
Yes, sir.

620
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,260
Can't believe this day finally came.

621
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,460
It feels like I'm dreaming.

622
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,990
You've been through a lot.

623
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,140
Congratulate me with more enthusiasm.

624
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,750
I arranged this get-together, too.

625
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,060
Enthusiastically...

626
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,340
Sincerely and enthusiastically, I congratulate you.

627
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,130
Cheers.

628
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,530
You know what?

629
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,130
I sometimes feel anxious even when I'm with you.

630
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,550
Because you don't seem fully focused on me.

631
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,480
It's not like that.

632
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,170
Okay.

633
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,850
Maybe we should move when things get settled.

634
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,700
I think this place is too small for the three of us.

635
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,480
- Ah Rin needs a room and-
- Yoon Jin.

636
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,590
Yoon Jin.

637
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:26,130
Let's take it slowly. Slowly.

638
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,770
You should focus on the unveiling ceremony today.

639
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,660
You're right.

640
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,100
Tonight is all about me.

641
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,220
Tonight is all about you.

642
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,690
Cheers. Congrats.

[Kwon Yoon Jin's "Portrait of a Woman" unveiling ceremony]

644
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,660
Ms. Kwon.

645
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,330
You made it.

646
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,000
Congratulations.

647
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,370
Congrats, Yoon Jin.

648
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,610
Thank you.

649
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,220
This is Seo Jae Won's office I've only heard about.

650
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,190
It's so nice.

651
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,330
It's the weekend. Aren't you going to rest?

652
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,760
Are you here for work?

653
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,670
That's what I'm asking.

654
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,650
I focus better on weekends.

655
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,180
There are too many people around on weekdays.

656
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,830
But still.

657
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,590
You should go get some fresh air, too.

658
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,800
I was jealous of you.

659
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:12,300
At first, I was jealous of your talent,

660
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,730
but I realized once we got close.

661
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,880
How passionate and affectionate you are

662
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,940
for a long time in order to complete one piece of artwork.

663
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,010
So, after that, I became envious of your genuine devotion.

664
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,830
There's nothing to be envious about.

665
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,340
This is all I have.

666
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,410
I have no business skills,

667
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,920
a kind husband, nor a pretty daughter like you.

668
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,520
To me,

669
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,910
my work is all I have.

670
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,570
This is my dream.

671
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,120
And this is my child.

672
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,660
How did it go?

673
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:17,780
No.

674
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,450
I haven't changed my mind.

675
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,620
Please continue as planned.

676
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,630
You're okay, right?

677
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,580
Of course. I feel great.

678
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,830
You decided after enough consideration, right?

679
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,500
What do you mean by that?

680
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,800
I can't understand how you feel entirely,

681
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:54,190
but I know what Dereve means to Seo Jae Won.

682
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,740
Don't worry.

683
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,740
Everything will be fine.

684
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,290
I'll get going now.

685
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,590
Before we start the ceremony, let's bring the star of the night, Ms. Kwon Yoon Jin, to the stage

686
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,500
and hear her thoughts.

687
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,010
Please welcome her with a round of applause.

688
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,280
Ms. Kwon, please come forward.

689
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,980
Thank you for coming.

690
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,660
While working for over 20 years,

691
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:45,110
I don't think I rested even for a moment.

692
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:49,310
While I hold my brushes with agony and anxiety,

693
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,520
you've shown me a lot of support.

694
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,060
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank so many of you.

695
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,180
Thank you.

696
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,060
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

697
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:07,200
Her speech was as exceptional as her beauty. Thank you.

698
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,610
We'll unveil Ms. Kwon's "Portrait of a Woman" now.

699
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,510
Let's count down loudly together.

700
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,960
Three, two, one!

701
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,200
That's so great.

702
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,260
Wow, Kwon Yoon Jin still got it.

703
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,540
Wow...

704
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:40,770
Yes. Let's hear from CEO Seo, who made time to join us amid her busy schedule.

705
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,300
May I say something, too?

706
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,480
- Yes.
- Of course.

707
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,250
For willingly agreeing to do this

708
00:58:55,310 --> 00:59:02,810
and for creating such a great piece, I want to thank Ms. Kwon Yoon Jin.

709
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,730
You all know.

710
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,220
That Yoon Jin definitely knows how to paint.

711
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,670
- You're right.
- We know. We know.

712
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,060
She gave me an amazing gift.

713
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,670
I also prepared something to return the favor.

714
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,560
This is for the mural.

715
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,680
Take it.

716
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,920
You should get paid for your work.

717
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,640
Seo Jae Won.

718
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,350
Is it not enough?

719
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,560
Will you really be like this?

720
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,940
Since you got paid,

721
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,510
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

722
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,750
I was curious whenever I saw this mural.

723
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:24,190
Did you say you wanted to paint a woman who paves her path without following the dated norms?

724
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,080
But why does the woman in the painting...

725
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,290
look so purposeless, as if she's completely hollow?

726
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,580
She believed she had everything,

727
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,320
but maybe she was just a pretty shell.

728
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,680
I decided not to be manipulated and deceived anymore.

729
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,540
So, I'm thinking of changing this mural a bit, too.

730
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,610
According to my taste.

731
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,720
What are you doing?

732
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,290
Hey, Seo Jae Won.

733
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,340
Let go. Let go!

734
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,650
Hey. Seo Jae Won!

735
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,820
Let go!

736
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,930
Don't do it. Don't do it.

737
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,880
Let go. Let go!

738
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,920
How could she...

739
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,130
Wow.

740
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,280
Geez. What is she, Banksy?

741
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,840
Mr. Heo Soon Yeong.

742
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,100
Who are you?

743
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,960
I'm with the police.

744
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,590
We're investigating who leaked Dereve's design.

745
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,640
Their design was leaked?

746
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,640
Yes. I received a report.

747
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,980
Excuse me.

748
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,770
[My Love]

749
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,470
Hey.

750
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,190
No need to be shocked.

751
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,210
This is nothing, considering what you two have done.

752
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,070
This is just the beginning.

753
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,720
Watch what happens when you mess with my daughter.

754
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,250
♫ I can fly to the moon ♫

755
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,460
♫ I can fly to the stars ♫

756
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:19,230
♫ Will I see the end of the dark sky that's hiding? ♫

757
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,140
♫ I can fly to the moon ♫

758
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:27,210
♫ I can fly to the stars ♫

759
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:36,520
♫ The night feels like a lie. It's hidden inside. ♫

760
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:44,430
♫ I followed the dark path without purpose ♫

761
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:51,130
♫ Could it be better than to be abandoned by the world? ♫

762
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,200
♫ On top of the white burnt ashes ♫

763
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,430
♫ My trust that was engraved in struggles ♫

764
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:06,390
♫ I got lost on the path with my fate predetermined ♫

765
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:10,020
[My Happy Ending]

766
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,320
Prepare a lawsuit if you don't want to leave empty-handed.

767
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,630
I was convinced that I should end this marriage.

768
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,900
Do you have anything to tell me regarding Jae Won?

769
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,300
If a spouse kept a serious illness like a mental condition a secret,

770
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,940
it could be a reason for a divorce.

771
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,370
Are you looking for something?

772
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,200
You didn't have to come all the way here.

773
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,620
It won't hurt to be careful.

774
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,750
When was the last time you saw Seung Gyu?

775
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,490
When he came to ask me to hold onto his stuff. That was the last time.

776
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,140
What are you thinking about?

777
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,930
- Pardon?
- Why are you blushing?

778
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,590
No. I don't want to eat!

779
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,780
Who said you can act out like this? Huh?

780
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,530
I hate you, Mom.

781
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,440
Why is it so hard to reach you?

782
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,360
Mom?
