But I came instead.

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,390
You must be very disappointed.

Ah Rin, how was living in the US?

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I heard you were in a musical, too.

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,870

Do you think that'd be necessary?

Did you really have two boyfriends in the US?

43
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,210
I had three in Korea.

Well, it just happened this way.

By the way, why are you giving this to me?

It's a secret.

82
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,230
Mom might feel hurt if she found out.

83
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,230
Is it okay to keep a secret from her?

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,210

Aren't you curious...

92

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,240
How did you feel after feeling afraid?

366
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,080
♫ In the time I cleared off ♫

367
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,280
♫ I wonder ♫

368
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,820
I thought I should face head-on now.

369
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,250
I thought I shouldn't avoid it anymore.

370
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,980
♫ Can make love scars just disappear? ♫

371
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,960
♫ But when I close my eyes ♫

372
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,070
Are you still not satisfied?

373
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,950
How much longer will you do this?

374
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,540
Do you know what comes to my mind whenever I get a call from the police?

375
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,130
Mom.

376
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,680
Mom!

377
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,670
I'm begging you to stop, okay?

378
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,490
This time, it's really unfair.

379
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,200
I really...

380
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,950
I didn't go there to gamble.

381
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,900
A friend told me to come over. So, I thought I'd check out her place-

382
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,800
Do you call that an excuse right now?

383
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,580
Hold on, Jae Won.

384
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,210
What?

385
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,690
It's nothing. Later.

386
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,570
I'll tell you later.

387
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:24,760
♫ In the night, when everything will start ♫

388
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:32,360
♫ I try and try to find my peace of mind ♫

389
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,920
♫ I'm walking with a broken heart ♫

390
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,420
♫ Can make love scars just disappear? ♫

391
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:53,700
♫ But when I close my eyes ♫

392
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,180
♫ In the passing moments ♫

393
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:08,600
♫ Your smile is stuck inside my heart with broken parts ♫

394
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:17,320
♫ Dull greetings in the midst of whispers ♫

395
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:31,800
♫ It falls to pieces whenever you come around awhile ♫

396
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,700
Gosh, Ah Rin. I left something at the grocery store.

397
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,300
What?

398
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,470
Oh, my God.

399
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,480
I'm sorry. Let's go real quick.

400
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,470
Here.

401
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,850
Jae Won,

402
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,460
why don't you take a break for a bit?

403
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,890
What are you talking about?

404
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,200
I'm here to take a break.

405
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,130
I meant all by yourself.

406
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,670
Where would I go without Ah Rin?

407
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,060
Ah Rin, what do you think about this?

408
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,320
I want Mom to go.

409
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,950
I think you should take a break, too.

410
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,830
Thank you for worrying about me,

411
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,250
but I swear I'm okay.

412
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,080
I appreciate it, but no thank you.

413
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,120
You'll get a lot busier when I start school next year.

414
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,840
I'm giving you a vacation in advance. Be sure to take it.

415
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,200
Aigoo...

416
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,410
Yes, Jae Won. You should go.

417
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,660
Ah Rin, where would you like her to take a trip to?

418
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,600
A theme park?

419
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,650
A theme park?

420
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,550
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

421
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,880
I think that was the first time...

422
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,200
where nothing happened each and every day.

423
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,970
A day where I didn't have to work so hard.

424
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,250
A day that lets me focus on nothing but myself.

425
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,300
It must've allowed you to relax.

426
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,140
How about the symptoms?

427
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,300
Were you still hallucinating then?

428
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,090
Wherever I went,

429
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,090
she was always with me.

430
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,590
And...

431
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,300
Who are you?

432
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,970
I must've scared you.

433
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,450
I'm sorry.

434
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,430
I'm the owner of the house.

435
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,470
I wanted to check if everything was okay.

436
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,080
Do you find anything uncomfortable?

437
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,790
Gosh, there isn't much in here.

438
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,100
Have you eaten?

439
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,240
I knew it wasn't real from the beginning.

440
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,520
Unlike my friend, Su Gyeong,

441
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,060
her presence didn't make any sense. Because it was my mom.

442
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,340
I found chamomile flowers on my walk.

443
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,940
Aren't they pretty?

444
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,290
I'll put them in the bedroom. Have a look.

445
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,030
These help you sleep, apparently.

446
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,610
Ms. Seo was cute when she was little, too.

447
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm not saying because she's my daughter. Whenever I went out with her,

448
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,160
everyone said she was so pretty and precious.

449
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,390
- Oppa.
- Yes.

450
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,810
Ah Rin is sleeping in the other room.

451
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,960
Okay.

452
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,030
By the way, who's he?

453
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,350
I'll tell you later. You should leave.

454
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,930
Hold on. You look familiar.

455
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,300
Oh, it's him. We met when we ate together last time, right?

456
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,600
Yes.

457
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,010
You look so handsome with the new hairstyle.

458
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,150
Leave right now.

459
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,660
Okay.

460
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,380
By the way, what brings you here?

461
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,850
Well, I wanted to see Father.

462
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,960
- "Father"?
- Hey, I told you to leave!

463
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,320
Gosh. Okay, fine.

464
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,650
By the way, how old are you?

465
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,550
Leave, leave! Geez, leave right now.

466
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,390
Take care.

467
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,030
Have a seat here.

468
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,650
You came because of Jae Won, right?

469
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes.

470
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,010
I'm not bothering her because I think she needs time on her own.

471
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,490
I know how strong she is.

472
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,160
So I know she must be hanging in there

473
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,910
and I should trust her and wait for her.

474
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,840
But I can't help but be worried.

475
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,400
I wonder if she's eating well

476
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,610
and what if she's feeling hurt or crying alone...

477
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,990
I just...

478
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,750
I just miss her.

479
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,770
Why...

480
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,440
are you trying to take a difficult path?

481
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,790
I like her very much.

482
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,450
That's the reason.

483
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,010
Nothing else.

484
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,600
The fact that you met your mom at the cabin

485
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,320
might mean it was meant to be.

486
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,360
Because your hurt feelings had to be resolved.

487
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,030
That's why I thought I shouldn't keep ignoring her.

488
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,550
You came.

489
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,470
Please prepare a meal for me.

490
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,510
Wait just a moment.

491
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,880
I haven't had lunch yet, either.

492
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,830
You don't mind me joining you, right?

493
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,510
Go ahead.

494
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,070
Eating alone makes you feel lonely.

495
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,330
Help yourself.

496
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,600
I noticed how skinny you are. You need to gain weight.

497
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,740
You need to eat well to gain weight.

498
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,600
Try some.

499
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,470
It's tasty.

500
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,250
This is lavender tea.

501
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,380
It smells so nice.

502
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,330
There's something I want to tell you.

503
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,770
You'll listen, right?

504
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,760
Yes, go ahead.

505
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
It happened when I was eight.

506
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,450
My mom tried to kill me then.

507
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,770
Mom.

508
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm cold.

509
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,010
I'm scared.

510
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,930
I want to go home.

511
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,390
Mom.

512
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,840
Why did you do that to me then?

513
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,720
Why did you do that to me?

514
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,600
I had no choice.

515
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,250
Life was so hard.

516
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,060
I couldn't endure it anymore.

517
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,080
You were so little. Leaving you behind

518
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,870
didn't feel right.

519
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,540
Stop making excuses.

520
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,270
Not everyone makes that choice just because life is hard.

521
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,990
You...

522
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,350
You just thought of me...

523
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,980
as your belonging.

524
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,320
You thought I was someone you could just

525
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,590
kill whenever.

526
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,400
Am I wrong?

527
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,940
I...

528
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,680
I didn't want to die.

529
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,550
I wanted to...

530
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,250
I wanted to live with you, Mom.

531
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,690
Because I really loved you.

532
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,180
Living happily with you

533
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,940
was everything I wanted.

534
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,940
So, apologize to me.

535
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,180
Apologize to me sincerely.

536
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,700
I'm sorry.

537
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,870
I'm so sorry.

538
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,450
Jae Won,

539
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,740
I did the wrong thing.

540
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,930
No matter how hard it was,

541
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,000
I shouldn't have done that.

542
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,510
It's all my fault.

543
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,360
Why was it so hard to say that?

544
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,170
Your whole life...

545
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,800
Why...

546
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,170
Why?

547
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,930
I wasn't trying to play ignorant forever.

548
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,670
I was going to tell you that day.

549
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,830
I wanted to tell you before you gave birth to Ah Rin.

550
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,310
Jae Won,

551
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,430
please remember this one thing.

552
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,850
It's not because...

553
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,530
I didn't...

554
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,380
love you.

555
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,150
I just...

556
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,990
didn't realize that because I was immature then.

557
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,640
Jae Won,

558
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,790
I'm so sorry.

559
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,370
I'm sorry.

560
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,230
I'm sorry.

561
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,560
Now...

562
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,450
forget all the bad memories.

563
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,750
Only remember the happy and good memories.

564
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,320
You must...

565
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,010
do that for yourself.

566
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,360
I will.

567
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,490
I know she wasn't real.

568
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,730
She was just an illusion I created.

569
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,230
But I had to do that-

570
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,350
I'm glad you did.

571
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,740
You took a step forward, Ms. Seo.

572
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,420
Is that so?

573
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,520
Mom, there's a dead bird here!

574
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,400
Ah Rin.

575
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,830
You're right.

576
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,510
I wonder what happened.

577
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,970
I feel bad for him.

578
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,300
Should we bury him?

579
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,740
- Yes.
- Okay.

580
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,000
Goodbye, birdie.

581
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,450
Rest easy in heaven.

582
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,770
Goodbye.

583
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,330
Well done.

584
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,700
Mom, where are we?

585
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,400
This is...

586
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,240
where Dad is.

587
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,470
Dad? Is he here?

588
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,440
- Yes.
- Where?

589
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,160
Where is he?

590
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,230
Dad!

591
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,790
Ah Rin...

592
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,050
He is here, but...

593
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,800
you won't be able to meet him.

594
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,340
Why?

595
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,270
Just like the little bird...

596
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,900
he went to heaven.

597
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,980
Just like the stone grave we made for the little birdie,

598
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,650
this place protects Dad and keeps him warm.

599
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,140
Is he dead?

600
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,200
- Yes.
- That's why you couldn't tell me, right?

601
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,580
Yes.

602
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,990
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you...

603
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,900
Dad went to heaven sooner, Ah Rin.

604
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,960
Dad.

605
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,970
I miss him a lot, too.

606
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,960
Dad!

607
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,700
[Heo Sun Yeong]

608
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,430
Dad, I missed you.

609
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:28,460
My English improved a lot while I was in the US.

610
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:34,940
I'll get the perfect score every day and visit you to brag about it.

611
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:41,670
So, don't forget to watch me.

612
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,210
Okay?

613
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,710
Dad, I love you.

614
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,250
How's the new collaboration project you mentioned going?

615
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,660
I sent the proposal to the designer.

616
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,860
The design team will have a meeting with her next week.

617
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,950
Shouldn't she have a meeting with me first?

618
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,360
This is our first collaboration with a freelance designer.

619
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,750
I'll decide whether we'll go forward with the project after I meet her.

620
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,320
Contact her and say I want to have a meeting today.

621
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,690
I'll ask if she'd be available.

622
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,360
How could a designer make the CEO wait?

623
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,750
Does this make any sense?

624
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,850
It sort of does.

625
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,330
Should I call her?

626
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,310
Let's wait five more minutes.

627
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,280
Sorry, I'm late.

628
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,190
You're three minutes late, Ms. Seo.

629
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:23,490
I'm sorry. I was contacted out of the blue.

630
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,180
Have a seat.

631
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,630
You brought the portfolio, right?

632
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,480
Yes, here it is.

633
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,980
Yes, you're as good as I heard.

634
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,810
Thank you.

635
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,500
You'll be working as the team leader of the new line for this project.

636
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,440
And you'll be working with us here at Dereve, too.

637
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,110
Would you be okay with that?

638
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,600
Just come back.

639
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,510
I'm in your care now, Team Leader Seo Jae Won.

640
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,290
I hope we get along, CEO Yun Te Oh.

641
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,020
How does it feel...

642
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,400
to become independent as a freelance designer?

643
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,430
It feels great.

644
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,360
I see.

645
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,000
You forced me to become the CEO.

646
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,410
And I've been working overtime every day,

647
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,420
but you're happy.

648
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,070
It's nighttime, but the weather is nice.

649
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,350
You know what?

650
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,300
You seem very relaxed these days.

651
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,430
Yes, I'm relaxed.

652
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:05,700
Sketching and making furniture all day

653
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,310
seems to make my worries disappear.

654
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,880
I started this because I enjoyed designing so much.

655
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,370
I wonder why I've been forgetting this feeling.

656
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,010
That's a relief.

657
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:28,110
Do whatever you want to do and enjoy the moment as much as possible.

658
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,420
Thank you, Te Oh.

659
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,180
It must've been a difficult decision.

660
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,100
But you took over Dereve for me.

661
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,240
Thank you so much.

662
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,300
Here we go again.

663
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,500
You keep thanking me because you're worried I might quit.

664
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,240
You got me.

665
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,290
If you're so thankful,

666
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,620
do you want to come to the meeting with the finance team later?

667
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,500
Look, I finished it.

668
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,600
You should manage it yourself, CEO.

669
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,320
How can you do this to me?

670
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,690
Gosh...

671
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,330
How about the sales team or the HR meeting?

672
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,630
Why don't you pick something nicer since you're going to Santiago?

673
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,850
What are you doing here?

674
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm watching you so you don't do anything stupid again.

675
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,580
These look good.

676
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,520
Should I get these?

677
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,340
- Are you coming, too?
- Give me a freaking break.

678
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,550
This is to celebrate you leaving jail.

679
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,510
What size do you wear?

680
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,800
What are you doing here?

681
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,910
Are you coming, too?

682
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:27,090
I brought a scoop that you'd be very interested in, Detective Nam.

683
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,850
Would you like to hear it?

684
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,090
I don't want it.

685
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,610
This is a huge deal, Detective Nam!

686
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,910
Those bastards.

687
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,540
I'm back from school!

688
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,410
Hi. Did you have a good day, Ah Rin?

689
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,680
Yes.

690
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,810
Wash your hands and get ready to go to the academy.

691
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,380
I just got home. Why go to the academy already?

692
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,920
I'm not going.

693
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,980
Did you finish your homework?

694
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,000
How much wealth and prosperity could I possibly get?

695
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:45,050
Heo Ah Rin, I'll cut your allowance by half if you don't get up immediately.

696
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,140
You can't do that.

697
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,880
Dad, what did you teach her?

698
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,860
I didn't teach her anything. She just picked it up.

699
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:13,310
♫ Looking at the sky that's getting further away ♫

700
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:19,180
♫ I leave without any regrets ♫

701
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:30,700
♫ Our time together will not appear different, either ♫

702
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:35,910
♫ Dreams will disappear ♫

703
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:41,690
♫ The dreams without you will all disappear ♫

704
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,590
Heo Ah Rin!

705
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,870
Ah Rin-

706
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,460
You took too long. Don't you think?

707
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,400
- You didn't forget anything, right?
- Of course not.

708
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,160
Let's go.

709
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:05,860
♫ Our previous paths might be a little different ♫

710
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:17,580
♫ Although I knew they weren't wrong ♫

711
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,400
Did you stay up all night?

712
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,310
You came.

713
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,040
Is there a lot to do? Why don't you take it easy?

714
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,160
Instead of saying that to me,

715
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,490
you could say I look cool, I'm doing great, or stuff like that.

716
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,850
I need to hear something like that.

717
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,560
You're doing so great, CEO Yun Te Oh.

718
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,180
Just with words?

719
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,650
You can do stuff like this. You know.

720
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,660
Get some rest.

721
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,460
This is me resting.

722
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm recharging right now.

723
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,740
As I mentioned last time, get a wide range of color samples for the bookshelf.

724
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,850
Yes, got it, CEO Seo.

725
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,860
I mean, Team Leader Seo.

726
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,130
I'm still saying that by habit.

727
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,130
I get confused sometimes, too.

728
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,800
I sometimes go to the CEO's office when I get here.

729
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,370
I think CEO Yun would like that.

730
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,980
Have some coffee first.

731
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,540
What's going on here?

732
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,810
Did you talk behind my back?

733
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,650
Thank you so much, Mr. Yun.

734
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,760
Wow, thank you.

735
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,310
Here you go.

736
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,340
That's it for today, right?

737
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,980
Yes, Mr. Yun.

738
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:00,460
I'll rest after confirming the design today, just so you know.

739
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,350
May I work outside the office, then?

740
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,620
Team Leader Seo asked me to join her for market research.

741
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,450
- Market research?
- Yes.

742
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:14,180
She wants to browse the new foreign brand shops in Shinsa-dong.

743
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,840
Go ahead.

744
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:20,140
Mr. Yun,

745
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:26,870
I'm suddenly thinking it might be better for an expert to join her instead.

746
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,960
Yes, I guess an expert should go since it's so important.

747
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,910
Thank you, Seong Hui.

748
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,110
Ms. Seo.

749
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,380
We've walked a lot. Aren't you tired?

750
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,890
No, I'm okay. I got to see new furniture, too.

751
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,590
Building a house somewhere like this,

752
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:17,450
raising children, making furniture,

753
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,420
and living with someone you love.

754
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,420
What do you think of that?

755
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,750
Why do you look at me like that?

756
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,220
Te Oh,

757
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,700
thank you.

758
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,130
Why all of a sudden?

759
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,850
At some point,

760
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:46,690
I started taking having you with me for granted.

761
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,250
I think I've forgotten how precious that is.

762
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,740
I'm sorry I realized that too late.

763
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,160
Why does your thanks sound like a goodbye to me?

764
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,010
Because we can't keep going like this.

765
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,090
Why can't we?

766
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,050
I'll surely continue to be by your side going forward.

767
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,670
Because I have an illness.

768
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,110
What's wrong with that?

769
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,720
It's an important matter.

770
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,000
Yes, it's important.

771
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,020
But that's not everything that defines you.

772
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,660
You have a lot more valuable things than that illness.

773
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,880
You're pretty,

774
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,060
cute,

775
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,400
and you're adorable, too.

776
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,040
The fact that you're ill is just a tiny...

777
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,300
Nothing but a tiny little part of you.

778
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,060
That's not entirely Seo Jae Won.

779
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,900
So, don't try to reject me using that.

780
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,370
I won't rush things.

781
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,120
So...

782
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,430
just don't push me away.

783
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,970
It might take a long time.

784
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,960
Would that be okay?

785
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,880
Do you mean...

786
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,820
Of course! Of course, I can wait.

787
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,430
You scared me.

788
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,240
How long do I have to wait?

789
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,600
It's not that I'm impatient.

790
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,570
It'd be nice to know a rough date. Until when?

791
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,940
I need to go. Ah Rin will be back soon.

792
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,140
So, when should I wait until?

793
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,500
Not until Ah Rin gets married or anything like that, right?

794
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,260
I need to hurry. I need to go.

795
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,330
Please tell me, Ms. Seo.

796
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:03,300
You achieved a lot more things than I expected.

797
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,010
I'll accept myself as who I am now.

798
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:16,470
And the three people whom I thought turned their backs on me.

799
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:25,820
I'll remember the fact that they were the most precious people who stood by me.

800
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:36,120
You need to continue your treatment going forward.

801
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,850
Yes, Doctor.

802
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,950
Thank you.

803
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:50,070
I've been wanting to tell you that in person at least once.

804
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:19,100
♫ What would it have been like if we hadn't become like this? ♫

805
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:25,860

Here's the last one!

812
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,440
One, two, three!

813
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,740
I think I finally understand...

814
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,930
that there's no happy ending in life.

815
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:12,980
You might be happy today, but you'll face hardship tomorrow.

816
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,710
But you'll become happy again the day after.

817
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:22,730
I just need to manage everyday life that gets repeated.

818
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:27,530
