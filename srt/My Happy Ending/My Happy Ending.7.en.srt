00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,480
Do you?

184
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
[Client A and C are not a match]

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,530
[Client A and C are not related since their STR in the DNAs don't match]

186
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,920
If you knew,

187
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,470
do you think you'd become free?

188
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,660
I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

189
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,170
I really want you to learn...

190
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,760
what it's like...

191
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,210
to live in hell.

192
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,540
[My Husband]

193
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,940
What are you doing here?

194
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,650
Since when have you been like this?

195
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,540
[Headache]

196
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,480
Just get angry and scream instead.

197
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,670
Or cry if you want.

198
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,930
Don't be like that and do something, Jae Won.

199
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,070
Am I supposed to?

200
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,970
It's because I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

201
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,110
What have I done in the past, exactly?

202
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,690
[CEO Seo Jae Won]

203
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,280
Shit.

204
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,900
Who the hell are you?

205
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,780
Geez. This is expensive.

206
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,580
You got caught doing something wrong. Why are you so proud?

207
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm just here to cover a story.

208
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,580
- Is that so? I can just check myself.
- Geez.

209
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,090
Hey. What are you doing?

210
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,890
Is taking photos illegally considered covering a story?

211
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,870
It's not that...

212
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,820
What are you so proud of, exactly?

213
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,620
I won't just let you do this to me, either.

214
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,870
What? Did you see something you weren't supposed to?

215
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,520
Have you been following Nam Tae Joo, too?

216
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,840
Sounds like you know him well, too.

217
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,730
I'm working on a huge story right now.

218
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,040
Well...

219
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,770
There will be a serious aftermath if this comes out.

220
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,130
Aren't you curious what I'm talking about?

221
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,110
I'll take this with me.

222
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,920
When did you find out?

223
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,340
That CEO Seo Jae Won isn't sane.

224
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,650
What are you talking about?

225
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,690
Did I hit the nail on the head?

226
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,740
I know it's a mental condition, but I don't know what it's called.

227
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,100
Give me a hint.

228
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,360
Or should I ask her husband, who's in a custody battle with her?

229
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,370
A mother can't raise her daughter if she's mentally ill, right?

230
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,440
Keep blabbering your mouth.

231
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,580
Sue me if you want.

232
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,740
For assault or whatever suits you.

233
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,920
According to the stock exchange history,

234
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,720
you own a lot of Dereve's shares.

235
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,940
You probably already know, but Seo Jae Won and I go way back.

236
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm concerned.

237
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,180
She's been causing noise because of the divorce and whatnot.

238
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,470
We don't have to prepare anything in particular for the hearing, right?

239
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,110
Excuse me.

240
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,830
Welcome, Minister Kwon Yeong Ik.

241
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,470
I heard Yoon Te Oh has been poking around the Baek Seung Gyu case.

242
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,360
He won't say anything unnecessary, right?

243
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,920
There's no way.

244
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,990
I covered up that case with my own hands.

245
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,640
- Yoon Te Oh-
- Regarding Yoon Te Oh...

246
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,490
Let's just keep an eye on him.

247
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,630
All the evidence is gone. What can he do?

248
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,490
Yes, come in.

249
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,520
I suppose I can leave now.

250
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,880
See you again, Minister.

251
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,400
Put it in his trunk.

252
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,800
I think it was at the first launch show.

253
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,740
Ms. Seo, we have five minutes left.

254
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,940
The atmosphere is great right now.

255
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,250
I hope it continues to be great after five minutes.

256
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,240
Let's welcome CEO Seo Jae Won of Dereve.

257
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,310
Hello, I'm Seo Jae Won.

258
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:42,400
I sincerely thank all of you for attending Dereve's first launch show.

259
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,310
Ms. Seo.

260
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,210
Say hello. This is Minister Song of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

261
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,390
Thank you for coming.

262
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,760
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

263
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,350
Chairman told me a lot about you.

264
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,850
She's been focusing on developing smart furniture.

265
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,420
She'll need a lot of your help from now on, Minister.

266
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,740
Of course, I'll help.

267
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,900
Should we raise our glasses?

268
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,350
Sounds great.

269
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,820
- Here.
- Well, I...

270
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,180
I can't drink...

271
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,010
Why not? You don't have other plans today.

272
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,060
Well, the thing is...

273
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,940
It's not that hard to have just one glass.

274
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,950
Hurry up.

275
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,240
What are you doing? Take it.

276
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,150
Okay, cheers, then.

277
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,140
See? You drink just fine.

278
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,230
Here. Should we have another round?

279
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,830
Sounds good.

280
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,580
For the future of the Minister and Dereve.

281
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,250
- Here.
- Cheers.

282
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,060
- You're a good drinker.
- Another round.

283
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,610
Here.

284
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,770
Ms. Seo.

285
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,600
Are you okay?

286
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,770
I think you drank too much.

287
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,910
[My Husband]

289
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,720
You got really drunk.

290
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,850
Where are you right now?

291
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,740
[Secretary Kim]

292
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,160
Who is this...

293
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,070
Yes.

294
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,450
Are you up, Ms. Seo?

295
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,990
Yes.

296
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,910
I'll pick you up at your room in 30 minutes.

297
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,670
By the way,

298
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,800
who brought me here...

299
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,050
last night?

300
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,970
Don't you remember?

301
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,440
I totally blacked out.

302
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,580
I saw you leaving while talking to Professor Heo on the phone, but...

303
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,020
[My Husband]

304
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,800
Where are you right now?

305
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,710
You're right.

306
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,130
You're right. That's what happened.

307
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,770
Should I get you some coffee to wake you up?

308
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes, please.

309
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,290
Hey, Soon Yeong.

310
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,790
Aigoo, did you get up just now?

311
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,060
Yes. My head hurts so much.

312
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,430
Seriously.

313
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,460
I told you not to drink so much.

314
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,190
Why did you drink so much last night?

315
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,620
I guess I was a bit excited after the first event.

316
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,030
Where are you?

317
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,380
I'm at school, of course.

318
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,660
When did you go there?

319
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,940
I left early this morning because I have lots of classes today.

320
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,090
Why didn't you wake me up?

321
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,170
I'm sorry. I was too out of it this morning.

322
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,430
- I should've given you a wake-up call.
- Professor.

323
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,720
Yes, yes.

324
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,670
I'm sorry, Honey. I'll call you later.

325
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,770
Yes, yes. Good luck with your classes.

326
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,780
What happened to Mr. Tidy?

327
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,480
I really didn't know.

328
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,830
I never even imagined it in my dreams.

329
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,900
I never thought she wouldn't be yours...

330
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,590
That's enough.

331
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,380
My gosh!

332
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,300
Soon Yeong, here...

333
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,460
Let go. Let go!

334
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,150
Do you think I'd believe that?

335
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:26,250
Did you even feel guilty toward me even a little bit?

336
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,940
You know...

337
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,660
my...

338
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,570
entire world was destroyed because of you.

339
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,330
But you...

340
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,800
talk about happiness while smiling?

341
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,670
Whenever you do that,

342
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,880
I...

343
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,540
hated you so much that I wanted to kill you. Did you know?

344
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm sorry.

345
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm so sorry.

346
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,120
No, Jae Won. It's too late.

347
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,740
What can I do for you?

348
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,580
What do you want me to do?

349
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,930
Give up on Ah Rin.

350
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,090
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,510
I don't think I could do that.

352
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,780
Okay.

353
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,940
Fine.

354
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,110
Let's take this to the end, then.

355
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,980
- Can I hold her?
- Of course.

356
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,340
♫ Why would it happen? ♫

357
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,040
Whoa, you're so pretty.

358
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,420
What woke you up, Ah Rin?

359
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,350
Here we go. Here we go.

360
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,650
♫ I wanna know ♫

361
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,210
♫ You blow in ♫

362
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:02,640
♫ I wanna know ♫

Soon Yeong. Soon Yeong, please hear me out.

540
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,920
I kept thinking over and over.

541
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:30,260
I kept thinking about how I would be forgiven for what I did to you.

542
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,790
What do you mean by that?

543
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,560
We're finished.

544
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,910
This is a warning. Don't visit Ah Rin's kindergarten.

545
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,170
I won't just sit still if you go there again without telling me.

Tell me what you're sorry about.

554
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,920
Can I tell you inside?

555
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,250
I see you were reading a book.

556
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,920
I've been too negligent lately, haven't I?

557
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,960
I didn't even know you were upset. Right?

558
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,080
I'm not angry because of that.

559
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,810
Why are you angry, then?

560
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,110
Because you told Dad to move out.

561
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:00,360
Ah Rin. That's because-

562
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,960
He cried a lot because he had a fight with his friend.

563
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,550
He was always there for me when I cried.

564
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,740
Mom, what if Dad cries outside again?

565
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,990
Neither you nor I will be there.

You don't seem to know my dad well yet.

719
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,860
I'm so scared.

720
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,030
I wonder...

721
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,180
what Ah Rin would think...

722
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,470
of this situation and...

723
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,670
how we are when she grows up.

724
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,820
What if she remembers me as a bad mom?

725
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,860
My Ah Rin...

726
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,640
My Ah Rin...

727
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,620
Please raise her well.

728
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,310
Ms. Seo, you came to work.

729
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,770
How are you feeling?

730
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,910
I'm fine. What's the schedule today?

731
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:37,330
Professor Heo said you need to rest for a few days.

732
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,560
So, I canceled everything this week.

733
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,290
Soon Yeong said that?

734
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,660
Yes.

735
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,740
Get everything back on schedule without missing anything.

736
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,140
Yes, I will.

737
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:52,620
Here's our bedding collection that will be released soon.

738
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,080
To get ahead in the bedding market,

739
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,410
we'll let the customers choose from the options

740
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:02,310
and let them customize their bedroom the way they want.

741
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,610
You mean you'll let the customers choose?

742
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,210
Yes, that's correct.

743
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,710
Let's do design preference research with our target audience.

744
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,510
Once we get the results,

745
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,550
we'll have the next meeting on the 17th.

746
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,390
The 17th?

747
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,390
Today is the 17th.

748
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,670
Wasn't today the 15th?

749
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,130
Today is the 17th, Ms. Seo.

750
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,790
Should we schedule the next meeting on the 19th, then?

751
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,280
Okay, then.

752
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,140
Did Team Leader Yoon go to an offsite meeting?

753
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,030
He went to the expo in Busan.

754
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,210
He'll probably come back tomorrow.

755
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,200
Expo?

756
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,400
He didn't mention it when I saw him yesterday.

757
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,290
He left the day before yesterday since he'd be gone for four days.

758
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,380
Ms. Seo, is something the matter?

759
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:17,940
No. What time is the client meeting?

760
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,220
You need to leave right now.

761
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,770
Ah Rin, wash your hands. Let's eat.

762
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:34,210
What are you thinking about, Ah Rin?

763
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:38,000
I made your favorite. Fried rice.

764
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,620
- Dad.
- Yes?

765
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,210
When is Mom coming back?

766
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:48,310
You know she's busy.

767
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:52,760
You should sleep with me tonight.

768
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,280
Oh? It's Mom!

769
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,260
Ah Rin! Mom's home!

770
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,580
- Mom!
- Ah Rin!

771
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:04,240
What did you do today? Did you have fun?

772
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,290
Mom, how could you not come home without telling me?

773
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,530
I was so busy with work. I'm so sorry.

774
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,970
Dad said you won't come home today, either.

775
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,960
You're a liar, Dad.

776
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,790
Did he? How strange.

777
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,180
Anyway, I'm sorry.

778
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,740
You have to sleep with me tonight instead.

779
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,450
- Okay.
- Here.

780
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,870
- Promise.
- Promise.

781
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,510
Ah Rin. Go wash your hands.

782
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,670
Okay.

783
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,080
Wash thoroughly.

784
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,060
Okay.

785
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,240
- Where have you been-
- I'm sorry, Honey.

786
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,250
I went to the hotel because I had more work, but I ended up falling asleep.

787
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,060
What are you talking about right now?

788
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,940
I'm so sorry.

789
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,490
I guess I've just been so busy signing contracts and having meetings.

790
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,010
Did you call Secretary Kim and tell her to cancel my schedule?

791
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,780
Well, Jae Won. Do you really-

792
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,060
Dad! I'm done washing my hands!

793
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,080
I'm so hungry right now. Can we talk after dinner?

794
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,420
Don't say there isn't food for me.

795
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,210
Were you very hungry, Ah Rin?

796
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:21,490
No. But food tastes so good today.

797
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,950
I think it's because I'm eating with both Mom and Dad.

798
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,900
Let's make sure the three of us eat dinner together from now on.

799
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,790
I'll come home early starting tomorrow.

800
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:38,040
Mom, Grandpa said you shouldn't make a promise you can't keep.

801
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,600
I'll try really hard this time.

802
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,130
Okay. I'll keep an eye on you.

803
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:50,110
Grandpa said we should go and catch a real big fish next time...

804
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,570
Mom, why are you holding Dad's hand?

805
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,040
You promised to sleep with me tonight.

806
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,140
It's not like that.

807
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:00,730
I'll sleep with you tonight, Ah Rin.

808
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:03,500
I'll stick right by you tonight.

[My Happy Ending]

817
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,500
She showed up as a totally different person yesterday.

818
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,110
As if nothing ever happened.

819
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,830
Why did Jae Won keep you by her side?

820
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,150
I have a bit of a history with CEO Seo.

821
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,170
Are you interested?

822
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:06,410
Do you take this yourself?

823
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:09,010
No, my wife does.

824
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,980
Her condition might be worsening now.

825
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,270
Hey, Jae Won. Do you want to meet me for a second?

826
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,200
Why are you still hanging around Jae Won?

827
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,790
Because the situation changed.

828
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:20,740
I was thinking of helping her.

829
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,290
To do my duty as a friend.

830
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,850
Jae Won. Seo Jae Won!

831
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,980
Everything you took from me.

832
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,280
I'll take all of them back.
