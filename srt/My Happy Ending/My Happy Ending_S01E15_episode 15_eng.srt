 My Happy Ending

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,260
 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents,
and situations in this drama are fictitious.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,120
Ajeossi...

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,580
sometimes...

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,130
I think I'm too useless a person.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,180
That's why I'm trying even harder.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,600
If I become a successful adult someday,

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,480
I want to make sure I'll be helpful to someone then.

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,810
And if I get to have a family,

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,650
I want my child to be loved more than anyone.

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,360
I want my child to have no worries or anxiety

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,770
and enjoy the most perfect happiness.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,870
That's my dream.

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,760
Yun Jin...

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,940
I'll make sure your dream comes true.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,270
Let's go.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,510
 My Happy Ending

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,870
I heard you were hospitalized due to auditory and visual hallucinations.

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,550
Is that correct?

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,180
Yes, that's correct.
  Episode 15

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,280
Do you still hallucinate?

28
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,730
Yes.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,320
Where's your hallucination right now?

30
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,180
Are they talking to you?

31
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,660
No.

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,460
How am I supposed to believe you?

33
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,260
You can't tell reality and fantasy apart,

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,950
and you're confused right now. Aren't you?

35
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,170
 I learned when she turned 15.

36
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,380
 We went to a psychiatrist, although it might've been overdue.

37
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,820
 But the rumor spread at school, and I saw her getting bullied.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,680
 I'm sure it wasn't just the kids.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,230
 The adults who treated her like a criminal

40
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,430
 because they thought she'd hurt their kids were worse, you could say.

41
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,250
 That's why I suggested we keep it a secret.

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,120
 Because I knew how hurtful people's criticism could be.

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,680
 So, I suggested we not let anyone know.

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,700
 No...

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,280
 you still should've told me.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,360
 At least, you should've told me if Jae Won couldn't.

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,630
 Yes.

48
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,490
 It's my fault, Sun Yeong.

49
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,910
 It's not like that could've cured her illness.

50
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,280
 The more she tried to hide it,

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,440
 the more she must've been hurting inside.

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,150
 I didn't know that.

53
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,110
 It's all due to me.

54
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,900
 It's all my fault.

55
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,270
Please answer, Witness.

56
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,480
Witness!

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,570
I killed her.

58
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,060
I killed her.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,380
Be quiet.

60
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,950
Please calm down, Defendant.

61
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,080
Let me make this clear.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,930
Are you admitting that you committed the crime right now?

63
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,270
It's my fault.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,180
So, please don't do this to my daughter.

65
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,880
I beg you.

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,640
Your Honor,

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,270
it appears the defendant couldn't tolerate how aggressively the prosecution

68
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,780
was questioning his daughter that he made the comment impulsively.

69
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,660
I hope you understand that.

70
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,950
Defendant, please be careful with your comments.

71
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,910
Prosecution, continue questioning.

72
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,620
Let me ask you one more time.

73
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,710
Aren't you confused, unable to tell reality apart from hallucination?

74
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm telling them apart accurately.

75
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,390
Just like how I'm understanding your question

76
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,490
and answering you right now.

77
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,620
Did you know that...

78
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,520
more than 30 percent of Korean people suffer from mental conditions?

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,050
You only need to answer my questions.

80
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,200
One out of three people...

81
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,170
can experience...

82
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,980
a mental condition at least once in their lives.

83
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,480
But our society still perceives mental conditions

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,700
as something to fear and loathe.

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,310
Shouldn't we change that perception first?

86
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,920
The patients and their families

87
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,370
are already suffering enough,

88
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,520
but it'd be too cruel to force them to endure prejudice, too.

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:34,900

90
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,360
The situation isn't great.

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,780
I explained that Mr. Seo said that impulsively

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,010
but I'm sure the judges will remember that.

93
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,640
It might affect the ruling.

94
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,720
So, you mean we need a witness to flip the script, right?

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes...

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,980
If there's a witness to testify that your mother

97
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,130
repeatedly took the pesticide with no intention of dying,

98
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,630
Mr. Seo will likely be acquitted.

99
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,070
 Call me with this when you decide.

100
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,280
 What's the reason you handed over the video first?

101
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,550
 Because that way, you'd take the negotiation seriously.

102
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,650
 I'll be betting this time.

103
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,180
 Let's try to save both you and me.

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,350
CEO,

105
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,370
I found someone in contact with Dr. Kim Seong Hun, her doctor at the time.

106
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,850
I'll meet with them tomorrow.

107
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,690
Thank you so much.

108
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,900
We just need to find the witness to testify she took the pesticide to threaten,

109
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,260
but Nam Tae Ju is probably the only one, right?

110
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,970
What do you think he actually wants?

111
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,990
We need to know that to put him in court.

112
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,150
He must've thought he couldn't continue hiding.

113
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,500
He must be planning to catch Kwon Yun Jin and save himself, too.

114
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,030
Why? Are you worried?

115
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,730
Yes, a little, you know.

116
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,130
We might be trusting him too quickly.

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,760
We're not trusting him.

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,910
We're using his desire to survive.

119
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,340
Because Nam Tae Ju will clear his name if Kwon Yun Jin gets caught.

120
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,820
Yes.

121
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,650
 It's my fault.

122
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,740
 Please don't do this to my daughter.

123
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,400
 I beg you.

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,560
 The patients and their families are already suffering enough,

125
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,850
 but it'd be too cruel to force them to endure prejudice, too.

126
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,490
Why?

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Why do you blabber your while acting superior,

128
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,860
Seo Jae Won?

129
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,790
Let's take care of Nam Tae Ju.

130
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,550
But we haven't found out what he hasâ€”

131
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,650
I changed my mind.

132
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,430
No matter what he has,

133
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,150
we just need to make sure he can't reveal it.

134
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,320
I've been overthinking too much.

135
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,650
I just had to remove him if he was in the way.

136
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,480
Got it.

137
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,050
Before I meet her,

138
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,060
I should get things out of the way first.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,870
Right?

140
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,360
 What did you eat?

141
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,230
I ate tomato spaghetti, scrambled eggs, and bacon.

142
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,340
 Right, you said you'll be in a musical for the recital, right?

143
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,240
How are the friends you practice with? Did you befriend them?

144
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,740
Of course.

145
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,210
I'm super popular here, too.

146
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,510
I want to see you perform, too.

147
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,760
 I'll show you when I go to Korea soon. Just wait until then.

148
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,260
Okay.

149
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,530
I'll have to start counting the days until you come.

150
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,950
 Okay. I'll go take a shower now, Mom.

151
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,500
Okay. Talk to you later.

152
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,440
 Okay, bye.

153
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,160
Don't worry so much.

154
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,400
The next hearing will go well.

155
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,980
Jae Won.

156
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,760
Dad,

157
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,340
do you remember what I said to you when I was 15?

158
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,320
I said I felt useless.

159
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,340
I said once I became successful,

160
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,940
I wanted to become helpful to someone, you know?

161
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,730
I really

162
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,530
wanted to help you achieve that dream.

163
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,180
But I always felt bad because I felt like I didn't get to.

164
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,190
I think it's my fault that you had to walk this difficult path.

165
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,850
Instead of hiding it and running away,

166
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,880
I should've told you to live confidently since it's not your fault that you're sick.

167
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,400
But I couldn't do that.

168
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,520
It's all my fault.

169
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,760
You kept your promise.

170
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,270
You made me plenty happy

171
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,970
just by being by my side.

172
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,780
It wasn't an easy favor to do.

173
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,110
So, please stop feeling guilty toward me.

174
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,260
For the remainder of your life,

175
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,040
care for and tend to yourself a lot more

176
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,810
so you can be with Ah Rin and me for a long time.

177
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,750
 How's your father doing?

178
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,320
He's fine.

179
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,040
That's good to hear.

180
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,480
Right, the doctor will make it to the hearing in time

181
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,080
since he got on the early flight.

182
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,010
Thanks for helping with that.

183
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,920
- Are you home?
 - No, I'm at the studio.

184
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,080
I have things to sort out before going back to work.

185
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,940
- How about you?
  - I'm on my way back.

186
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,790
If so, stop by the studio for a moment.

187
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,600
I need to ask you something, too.

188
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,730
 Okay, see you there.

189
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,510
You haven't been here in a while, right?

190
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,880
I've been forgetting

191
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
how great of an artist you were.

192
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,350
Did you forget about that?

193
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,170
You came all the way to the US to scout me four years ago.

194
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm a bit disappointed.

195
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,730
I know.

196
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,770
Why did you want me to come here, by the way?

197
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,590
Oh, well,

198
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,450
for the same reason as then.

199
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,690
I wanted to see the Seo Jae Won I heard about.

200
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,100
DerÃªve's CEO, Seo Jae Won.

201
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,140
You took longer than I thought.

202
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,180
So, what did Kwon Yun Jin say?

203
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,790
Are you trying to negotiate or threaten?

204
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,900
Wow, you have a nice knife.

205
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,960
It's not a kitchen knife.

206
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,790
 Finished.

207
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,430
 Wonjin District Court

208
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,110
- You couldn't reach Nam Tae Ju yet, right?
 - No.

209
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,220
I can't contact him.

210
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,170
I suppose something isn't going your way.

211
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,380
Don't waste your energy.

212
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,030
December 4th, 2023. Wonjin District Court's Criminal Division No. 8 will

213
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,470
start the afternoon hearing.

214
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,080
This is the case of Defendant Seo Chang Seok, 2023GoHab1402.

215
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,150
The prosecution, defense, and defendant. Is everyone present?

216
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,850
- Yes.
 - Yes.

217
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,890
Were you Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang's doctor

218
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,290
when she was sent to the ER after taking a pesticide?

219
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,470
Yes, that's correct.

220
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,270
I was present the first three times she came in.

221
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,030
But I was off duty the fourth time she came in.

222
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,860
What condition was she in at the time?

223
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,870
I know she got her stomach pumped,

224
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,960
but she had chronic nephritis and took a pesticide.

225
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,610
Is it common for someone like that to recover enough to get discharged?

226
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,270
- Not to mention, it happened three times.
 - It's uncommon.

227
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,460
But that was possible because Ms. Jeong took a diluted pesticide.

228
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,100
- In all three occasions, correct?
 - Yes.

229
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,430
So, until you told the defendant, he wasn't aware

230
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,760
that Ms. Jeong took a less than lethal dose of pesticide three times?

231
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,880
That's how I understood it.

232
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,520
He seemed quite shocked.

233
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,390
That's all.

234
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,140
Witness, when the defendant first brought the victim to the ER,

235
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,640
he said she took a pesticide by accident. Is that true?

236
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,030
Yes, it's true.

237
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,570
Instead of telling the truth that she took the pesticide on purpose,

238
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,760
why would he lie that she had taken it by mistake?

239
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,150
He refused an autopsy, and he lied to get prescriptions.

240
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,860
And he lied that she had taken the pesticide by mistake.

241
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,280
How do we know if he isn't lying again?

242
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,840
The defense's next witness, Mr. Nam Tae Ju.

243
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
Please come to the witness stand.

244
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,520
Is he not here?

245
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,280
Nam Tae Ju is here.

246
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,360
Yes, we'll start questioning Witness Nam Tae Ju, then.

247
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,600
Your Honor, the witness, Nam Tae Ju, is a murder suspect who's wanted for

248
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
killing a man in his 30s recently.

249
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
Even if he testifies, the credibility of his testimony should be questioned.

250
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,530
Be quiet. Be quiet. Everyone, be quiet.

251
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,930
Witness Nam Tae Ju.

252
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,680
Is it true what the prosecution said?

253
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,510
It is true I'm wanted,

254
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,450
but I didn't kill him.

255
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,840
I came because I'm innocent.

256
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,280
According to Clause 146 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

257
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,090
he can be questioned as a witness

258
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,830
even though he's a murder suspect in a separate case.

259
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,760
Witness, take the oath.

260
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,650
Witness's oath.

261
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,220
I swear that I'll state the truth without hiding or adding anything

262
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,570
and if I lie, I'll be punished for committing perjury.

263
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,920
Witness, Nam Tae Ju.

264
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,830
Have a seat, Witness.

265
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,930
The defense may start the questioning.

266
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,060
Witness, you were the insurance inspector for the payout the defendant received.

267
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,240
That's correct.

268
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,100
Who signed up for Ms. Jeong's life insurance plan?

269
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,690
It was Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang.

270
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,090
I see.

271
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,250
How did you know Ms. Jeong?

272
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,660
We used to gamble together.

273
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,180
You must've talked to her a lot, then.

274
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,250
Oh, gosh.

275
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,800
We talked about all sorts of things.

276
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,120
Regarding taking the pesticide, too?

277
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,890
She kept bringing more money even after she lost.

278
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,480
I asked her where she got the money, and she said her husband gave it to her.

279
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
She said she took the pesticide out of anger at first and managed to survive,

280
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,920
but he kept giving her money because he got so scared.

281
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,090
She said, "You won't die for taking a pesticide diluted with water."

282
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,010
That's all.

283
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,130
 Judge

284
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,450
You have the right to an attorney.

285
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,490
You have the right to remain silent.

286
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,460
You know the rest, right?

287
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,370
Here I go. Bam.

288
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,890
Let's get going.

289
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,310
I'll announce the ruling for 2023GoHab1402, Defendant Seo Chang Seok's case.

290
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,140
Defendant, please stand up.

291
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:15,310
Defendant, you were charged with murder and insurance fraud.

292
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,720
He insisted that he did not intend to kill.

293
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,570
Murder is often committed by taking a certain action proactively,

294
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,880
but when someone's a guardian,

295
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,750
who's required to protect the other person by law,

296
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,390
and was aware they could've saved the protected person who faced a life-threatening condition,

297
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,840
but decided not to, it can be considered a murder.

298
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,450
In this case, the defendant was aware the victim

299
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,330
suffered from chronic nephritis,

300
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,680
but when she took a pesticide, he waited to call 911.

301
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,600
He refused to get an autopsy on her.

302
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,230
And considering he spent the entire 500 million won

303
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,440
he received as the life insurance payout,

304
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,560
the defendant, whose duty was to protect the victim as her husband,

305
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:15,800
can be suspected of intending the murder by being willfully negligent.

306
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,080
However, although he waited a moment to call 911 on the day of the incident,

307
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,600
he tried to save the victim by eventually calling 911.

308
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,570
Considering the long period of time

309
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,010
the victim has been hurting her family by gambling,

310
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,710
he had cared for his young stepdaughter,

311
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,620
who was neglected all alone.

312
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,150
It's convincing that he was angry at the moment and waited briefly

313
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,850
to call 911 since he thought she took the pesticide to threaten him.

314
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:58,160
And it appears he might've thought that she wouldn't die.

315
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,020
In conclusion, the evidence that was submitted to this court

316
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,770
is not enough to prove the defendant's intention to murder.

317
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,780
Therefore, since there is no evidence for the charge of murder,

318
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,190
the court concludes that, according to Clause 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

319
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,500
the defendant is not guilty.

320
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,460
However, it is acknowledged that he's guilty of breaching the Insurance Fraud Prevention Law.

321
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,230
Accordingly, the sentence is as follows.

322
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,350
The defendant will be sentenced to one year in prison.

323
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,310
However, the sentence will be suspended

324
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,320
for three years starting from the sentencing date.

325
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,940
He is not guilty of the murder charge.

326
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,910
Thank you.

327
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,730
What's this?

328
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,570
Did you come yourself to get rid of me completely this time?

329
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,570
You get scared more easily than I thought, Mr. Nam.

330
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,910
Do you think you'll be safer in there?

331
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,120
Who's the one who's scared right now?

332
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,660
Didn't you come because you're worried about what I've got?

333
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,450
I know that's...

334
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,130
the video of Sun Yeong.

335
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,800
You sure are quick.

336
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,900
I didn't trust you, just like how you didn't trust me.

337
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,000
I got paid about one billion less.

338
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,390
Get it ready.

339
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,990
I'll get rid of the video and cover it all up for you.

340
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,400
That's up for discussion after you get released.

341
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,050
Kidnap and murder.

342
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,970
We don't know when you'll get out.

343
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,050
Bye.

344
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,560
Bam.

345
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,610
Aunt, come and eat with us.

346
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,680
I need to go now. Enjoy your meal.

347
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,470
- I'll leave, Oppa.
 - Okay. Say hello to Brother-in-law for me.

348
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,100
- See you, Aunt.
 - See you.

349
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,270
Get home safely.

350
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,510
Have a seat.

351
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,930
- Let's eat.
 - I told you not to cook for us.

352
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,380
Gosh, I just wanted to have a meal with you.

353
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,620
Help yourself.

354
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,420
- Thanks for the meal.
 - Eat a lot.

355
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,800
Yes, Detective Oh.

356
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,240
Hold on a second. Excuse me.

357
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,750
I'll be on the phone briefly.

358
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,030
May I pour you a drink?

359
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,680
Yes, of course.

360
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
Here.

361
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,910
Thank you.

362
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,580
- Let me pour you one, too.
 - Yes, sounds good.

363
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,240
You've been through a lot.

364
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,250
Here. Cheers.

365
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,350
It's pretty strong stuff.

366
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,950
Are you okay?

367
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,580
Yes, I'm okay.

368
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,440
Would you like another glass, then?

369
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,380
Yes, sounds good.

370
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,060
Here.

371
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,050
Thank you for helping Jae Won all this time.

372
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,490
We should've done this sooner.

373
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,320
I hope it's not too late.

374
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,120
Not at all. I helped because I wanted to.

375
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,280
I'll continue to help her from now on.

376
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,670
So don't worry so much, Father.

377
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,240
"Father"...

378
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,900
Oh, okay.

379
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,720
- Have some more.
 - Okay.

380
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,780
You shouldn't have drunk everything he gave you.

381
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,430
I said I'm okay.

382
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,960
Where's Father, by the way?

383
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,550
He's at home.

384
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,670
Oh, right.

385
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,740
Where am I by the way?

386
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,900
This is no good. Get fresh air for a moment.

387
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,080
I'll get you something to help you sober up. Okay?

388
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,510
My wallet.

389
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,940
Give me.

390
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,660
Ah... wait a second.

391
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,300
Here you go.

392
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,380
Te Oh.

393
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,100
Oh, it's Seo Jae Won.

394
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,120
Let's go home after you sober up. I'll drive.

395
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,250
Have a seat here for a moment.

396
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,210
Sit just for a moment.

397
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,420
Can I be honest since I'm a bit drunk today?

398
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,120
What are you trying to say now?

399
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,360
What's this?

400
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,550
I'm just happy.

401
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,530
Don't be silly.

402
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,550
A lot has happened so far.

403
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,650
You cried a lot, Seo Jae Won.

404
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,190
You should laugh a lot

405
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,990
and do whatever you want to do. Do that from now on.

406
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,350
- I will.
 - Tell me.

407
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,610
What do you want to do the most right now?

408
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,540
What if I told you?

409
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,320
I want to join you, too.

410
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,040
You don't know what I want to do.

411
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,690
Whatever it is,

412
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,310
I want to join you in whatever you do.

413
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,610
Do you want to join me because...

414
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,830
of this by chance? 
 Seo Yun Jin

415
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,310
Huh?

416
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,540
How did you find this?

417
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,470
You already knew I was Seo Yun Jin.

418
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,530
But how did you end up with this name tag?

419
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,010
It's your fault.

420
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,620
Get up! Get up, I said!

421
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,680
- I'll beat you.
 - Get up, get up!

422
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,450
I would've gotten adopted if it weren't for you.

423
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,800
You're blaming me?

424
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,470
Yes. I heard your parents died because of you, too.

425
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,720
It's all your fault.

426
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,390
You need to take a shower.

427
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,030
You're not getting adopted because you stink. How dare you blame him?

428
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,960
Get out of here.

429
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,590
Let's go.

430
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,540
It's not your fault.

431
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,180
You didn't...

432
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,830
do anything wrong.

433
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:39,590
 Seongjin Orphanage

434
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,760
Don't be discouraged.

435
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,440
You're cooler than me when I was eight years old.

436
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,890
Really?

437
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,870
It's half true.

438
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,500
Nuna, are you coming back?

439
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,890
You said you're leaving this place.

440
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,520
I'll get going.

441
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,010
Nuna.

442
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,990
Your name tag.

443
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,080
Can you give it to me?

444
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,680
 Seo Yun Jin

445
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,290
This?

446
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,040
Why do you want this?

447
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,950
I think I might need it.

448
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,630
Could you?

449
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,080
Anyway, I'll change my name soon.

450
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,410
It doesn't matter. Not at all.

451
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,660
â™«  Like a dream will it disappear If I close my eyes?  â™«

452
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,130
Here.

453
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,340
 Seo Yun Jin

454
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,480
Make sure to keep it for generations.

455
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,060
I'm leaving for real now.

456
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:59,300
â™«  But when I close my eyes  â™«

457
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:07,850
â™«  Both your smile in the moment which brushed by  â™«

458
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:13,600
â™«  Stuck inside my heart with broken parts  â™«

459
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,820
Was that you?

460
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,800
That little boy?

461
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:28,660
â™«  It falls to pieces when you come around  â™«

462
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,350
I tried so hard to hide the fact

463
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:39,100
that I take medicine as well as the scars on my body, but...

464
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,950
you caught me twice already.

465
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,610
That's why I fell in love with you twice.

466
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,250
You weren't so shameless when you were a kid.

467
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:58,840
â™«  I try and try to find my peace of mind â™«

468
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,770
Thank you...

469
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,000
for saving me when I didn't have anything.

470
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,530
â™«  Can you make all of the scars just disappear  â™«

471
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,840
I think I should thank you more.

472
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,100
â™«  But when I close my eyes   â™«

473
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,530
While living as Seo Yun Jin,

474
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,970
I thought I didn't have many good memories.

475
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,220
But I'm glad that it was...

476
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,010
a fond memory for you.

477
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,800
â™«  Stuck inside my heart with broken parts  â™«

478
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,380
- That's whyâ€” 
 - It's getting late.

479
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,520
Let's say bye to him and leave.

480
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,560
â™«  and the bland greeting in the whispered words  â™«

481
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,060
â™«  falls to pieces whenever  â™«

482
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,860
 Seo Yun Jin

483
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,210
â™«   you come around  â™«

484
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,150
â™«  Oh why  â™«

485
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,620
 From Seo Jae Won: 20312-23, Miwu-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Building A, Myeongyang Industrial Complex

486
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:25,030

487
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,630
Your expression is different from that time, Kwon Yun Jin.

488
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,710
All you sent was just a photo.

489
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,390
Hey.

490
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,670
Don't you think we're meeting somewhere too grandiose?

491
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,080
But it looks like you came in a rush.

492
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,210
You should've come to the office directly.

493
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,640
Why don't you talk to me in front of all the employees?

494
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,810
I wanted you to realize even a tiny bit

495
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,460
what you've done in this place.

496
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,970
This is such a joke.

497
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,340
 In the end, you ended up this way, my Sun Yeong.

498
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,980
 I did contact the chairman. Do you think it'll work?

499
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,010
 It's already working.

500
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,020
Do you still think this is a joke?

501
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,290
What's the reason you're showing me this?

502
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,870
Why don't you just take that to the police immediately?

503
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,210
I'm giving you a last chance.

504
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,340
And I'm hoping...

505
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:12,190
the 15-year-old Kwon Yun Jin I knew

506
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,730
is still there somewhere within you.

507
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,420
Do whatever you want.

508
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,320
I don't care if you send it to the police or the press.

509
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,850
Do you think I won't be able to escape?

510
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,310
What happened to Sun Yeong was an accident.

511
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,930
That's why my father is paying for that right now.

512
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,300
How did you end up this way?

513
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,690
Why do you think you're so superior?

514
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,040
You had nothing.

515
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,500
All you had was your mental illness, but I was the one who helped you.

516
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,850
How dare you pity me?

517
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,680
You showed me the video pretending to be generous. And what did you say?

518
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,030
Last chance?

519
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,070
You make me sick.

520
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,690
Stop acting fake.

521
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,370
I'll get going.

522
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,560
I gave you an option.

523
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,660
 What?

524
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,740
 Are you interested?

525
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,730
 My dad doesn't think so.

526
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,550
 He said it's useless unless you win first place.

527
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,260
 Isn't that so annoying?

528
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,050
 Was that kind of funny?

529
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,880
 Jae Won,

530
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,060
 let us make art together.

531
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,210
It'd be okay, right?

532
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:02,590
â™«  If you follow the footsteps  â™«

533
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:08,400
â™«  Iof someone whose heart left first  â™«

534
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,330

535
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:21,730
â™«  what will we be like?  â™«

536
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,440
â™«  I''m sure we'll dance  â™«

537
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,010
â™«  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  â™«

538
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:38,300
â™«  Without thnking about anything  â™«

539
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,180
 I'll forget everything now.

540
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,390
 So, I don't forget one thing.

541
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,670
 - I'll alsoâ€” 
 - Will you join me?

542
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,010
 Pardon?

543
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,270
 I'm asking you to help me.

544
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:01,120
â™«  As though every day is our last  â™«

545
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,370
 Here's the evidence that Kim Sang Beom's company manipulated the clinical trials.

546
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,520
 Wait just a moment.

547
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,510
 It won't take long.

548
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,960
 This is a setup.

549
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,830
 The video was fabricated.

550
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,150
 Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik.

551
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,330
 You're under arrest for kidnapping Seo Jae Won and murdering Heo Sun Yeong.

552
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,960
 Te Oh, is that Seung Gyu?

553
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,720
 Te Oh! Is that Seung Gyu?

554
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:41,020
 You'll never be able to see your family again.

555
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:46,400
 I'll no longer feel ashamed in front of Ah Rin as her father.

556
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,600
â™«  I'm sure we'll dance  â™«

557
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,310
â™«  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  â™«

558
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:06,840
â™«  Without thinking about anything  â™«

559
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,850
â™«  I'm sure we'll dance  â™«

560
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,450
What do you think?

561
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,880
Isn't it clean?

562
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,650
Did you do all this?

563
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,840
I just wanted to do this once.

564
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,990
You're not so good at housekeeping.

565
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,630
â™«  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  â™«

566
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,970
I'm sorry.

567
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,080
I took them down without asking.

568
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,960
Thank you...

569
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,090
for taking them down for me.

570
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,840
Mr. Nam! Are you okay?

571
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,700
What's going on?

572
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,450
I'm not sure.

573
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,200
Hand me the key. The key! The key!

574
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,010
Are you okay?

575
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,600
This wouldn't have happened if you had taken care of Nam Tae Ju property!

576
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,030
I'm sorry.

577
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,060
 Kwon Yun Jin, you resemble your father.

578
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,860
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,410
I...

580
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,950
I suddenly got too riled up.

581
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,010
I'm sorry, Yun Je.

582
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,540
I get what happened to Nam Tae Ju,

583
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,280
but why isn't Seo Jae Won releasing the video? Why?

584
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,710
Ah Rin?

585
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,320
It was because of Ah Rin.

586
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,070
Ah Rin.

587
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,470
What's going on, Ms. Kwon?

588
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,980
 Resignation Letter

589
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,470
What's this?

590
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,130
I'm stepping down as the CEO.

591
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,850
That's not what I'm asking.

592
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:19,930
I'm sure this won't be a bad thing for you.

593
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,500
Are you really going to step down from the CEO position?

594
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,740
I want to rest a bit.

595
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,080
Please take good care of things, Mr. Park.

596
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,560
Go eat something. I'll guard here.

597
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,020
- Would that be okay?
 - Yes.

598
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,370
Thank you.

599
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,210
Hey, Park Jong Hun.

600
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,800
You're acting like a senior now.

601
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,100
Are you experienced enough?

602
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,310
You're getting released soon. Get ready for it.

603
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,720
Going to the bathroom feels like work now. Geez.

604
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,380
Will you undo this or wipe for me?

605
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,270
You've got to be kidding me.

606
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,860
I'll be right out.

607
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,670
Geez. Hey, Jong Hun!

608
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,250
I need your help here. Please?

609
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,770
Geezâ€”

610
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:59,360
Geez. Seriously.

611
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,070
Take a nap for a bit.

612
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,920
You'll get up soon.

613
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,780
 Test Results

614
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,770
 DNA Test

615
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,970
 Heo Ah Rin, Seo Jae Won's daughter, isn't Heo Sun Yeong's daughter

616
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,090
 Reporter Choi of Hot Issue Today

617
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,480
 No Caller ID

618
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,810
 No Caller ID

619
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,980
 Have you been well?

620
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,580
What's the deal?

621
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,150
How did you get out?

622
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,460
What do you mean, how? I walked out.

623
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,140
Did you prepare the one billion?

624
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:54,030
Seo Jae Won has that video.

625
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,530
The deal is off, then. Isn't it?

626
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,070
Don't you know better?

627
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,080
The original file is what matters. Do you think she'll reveal the video?

628
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,470
She cares about her family more than anything.

629
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,910
Let's talk in person.

630
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,670
Shall we, then?

631
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,700
I'll be in touch.

632
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:43,550
I should forget about my promotion because of you.

633
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,930
Give me a break.

634
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,110
Why would that be my fault?

635
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,210
You weren't going to get promoted, anyway.

636
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,560
You're dead if you fail this time.

637
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,260
I'm the one screwed if I fail. Not you.

638
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,180
Gosh, selfish bastard.

639
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,320
Anyway, I'm surprised by you.

640
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,750
Can't believe you'd play a trick like this.

641
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,000
Hey, Jang Hyeon. Long time no see. I thought you were taking a break.

642
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
- I just stopped by for a moment. 
- Oh, okay.

643
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:31,920
 Geez. Hey, Jong Hun! I need your help here.

644
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,270
It wasn't me.

645
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,700
By chance...

646
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,840
was it Seo Jae Won?

647
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,710
Get down.

648
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,610
If Kwon Yun Jin is the culprit, as Nam Tae Ju says,

649
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,420
we need something to prove it.

650
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:58,280
But he said he bet on you or some nonsense like that. Geez...

651
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,190
I need your help, Detective Oh.

652
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,530
Come on, murder and jailbreak.

653
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,570
Aren't you being too reckless?

654
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,540
I'll be even more reckless if you keep talking.

655
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,480
Will you continue?

656
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:40,450
I suppose you're feeling impatient, Mr. Nam.

657
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,060
Am I?

658
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,990
Where's the money?

659
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,730
Gosh, I missed you.

660
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,790
Thanks to you, the only photo of my wife was stabbed.

661
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,500
I don't know how to thank you.

662
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,460
Where's the goods?

663
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,760
This?

664
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,040
Come and get it.

665
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,330
I can't come because it's heavy.

666
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,090
What a rude bastard.

667
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,260
How nice and clean.

668
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,460
What are you planning to do from now on?

669
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,100
What are you planning to do?

670
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,690
Answering a question with another isn't so good.

671
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,830
I'm just curious.

672
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,280
You abandoned your parent and committed murder.

673
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,040
I was wondering what comes next.

674
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,570
Who's the murderer now?

675
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:07,570
Aren't you the one who committed murder?

676
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,250
Me?

677
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,790
Wow, I didn't know.

678
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,890
Do you feel better if you say that?

679
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,810
I don't think Kwon Yun Jin simply wanted to

680
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,570
take revenge on Seo Jae Won.

681
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,960
You wanted to destroy her completely.

682
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,360
You would've damaged her, no matter what it took.

683
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,480
 You were interested in her daughter simply because

684
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,340
 she was someone precious to Seo Jae Won.

685
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,740
 She was just a trophy you wanted to steal.

686
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,750
Shut your mouth...

687
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,140
Before I rip your mouth apart.

688
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,470
Did I hit the nail on the head?

689
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:59,830
Did you also get rid of Baek Seung Gyu for the same reason?

690
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,330
Just tell me. I want to know, at least.

691
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,780
Why did you kill Baek Seung Gyu?

692
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,900
Well...

693
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,110
Him saying, "CEO Seo, CEO Seo"

694
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,980
was too annoying to me.

695
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:23,880
You're right. He died because of his silly mouth.

696
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,650
 You're finally coming clean.

697
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,920
 Will anything change because you know?

698
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,080
The world already... thinks you killed him.

699
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,320
I was able to satisfy my curiosity, at least.

700
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,580
Oh, really?

701
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,660
Gosh, I'm so glad.

702
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,710
Then, you'll have no regrets even if you die now.

703
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,570
Geez...

704
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,570
I knew it was going too well.

705
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,210
 Come at me.

706
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,050
Freeze!

707
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,050
You have the right to remain silent.

708
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,820
You have the right to an attorney.

709
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,430
I'll send you a lawyer.

710
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,780
You can get out quickly with extenuating circumstances if you behave.

711
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:35,300
You make deals very cleanly.

712
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,720
I don't think it'll be necessary for me to step in.

713
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,990
The way you talk is so clean-cut, too.

714
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,620
I hope you stay quiet.

715
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:49,790
It'd be better if we didn't have to see each other again.

716
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,110
 Here's the next story.

717
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:57,270
 The police stated the suspect for the murder of Baek, a man in his 30s,

718
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:00,740
 is Kwon Yun Jin, the former CEO of DerÃªve.

719
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,660
 As if she predicted that her crimes would be revealed,

720
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,740
 she resigned as the CEO and is currently a fugitive

721
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,050
 wanted by the police.

722
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,190
 And there's a possibility she was an accomplice for the murder of

723
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,950
 Heo Sun Yeong, a few months ago.

724
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:20,700
 The police said they'll arrest Ms. Kwon and find out the truth.

725
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:58,740
â™«  I really want to stay in your mind  â™«

726
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:03,150
â™«  In a small space  â™«

727
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,550
â™«  Wherever it might be  â™«

728
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,720
Hello, CEO.

729
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:12,420
â™«  And you feel alone, even if you fail  â™«

730
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,760
It feels weird since it's been so long.

731
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,640
You'll get used to it quickly.

732
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,870
A very tight schedule is awaiting you on your first day.

733
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,020
Where should I start?

734
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,750
â™«  Like the spring which bloomed after winter  â™«

735
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,160
Work on the details based on the lifestyle.

736
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,160
- What are the dimensions of the space for the artwork?
 - Of course.

737
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,540
â™«  If you cry, I'll make you smile  â™«

738
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,790
â™«  Look at me one more time  â™«

739
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:50,870
â™«  You can just lean on me  â™«

740
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,290
Did you pick the one you like?

741
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,040
Can I have this headboard...

742
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,360
with those legs?

743
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:06,480
Of course. You can choose the mattress topper you want, too.

744
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,350
We'll go with this set, then.

745
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,460
Got it.

746
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,600
Looks like the new customizable bed is being received well.

747
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,760
Please keep an eye on the reviews for each option.

748
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,540
I'll refer to the data for the next new product.

749
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,590
Yes, got it.

750
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:26,070
â™«  Even if you leave me now  â™«

751
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:33,910
â™«  I will wait for you here  â™«

752
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,160
Aren't you overdoing it?

753
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,450
I've been gone for a long time.

754
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,590
I should adjust quickly.

755
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,090
There's a lot to do, too.

756
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,800
Sounds like you're back to the old Seo Jae Won.

757
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,150
What's "the old Seo Jae Won"?

758
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,870
A workaholic who doesn't allow a tiny mistake.

759
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,150
Sounds more like an insult than a compliment.

760
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,060
You read the room fast, too.

761
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,450
You've really come a long way.

762
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,690
I won't work late tonight.

763
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,220
I need to pick up Ah Rin.

764
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,040
I heard she's coming back on her own.

765
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,490
She's already all grown up.

766
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,460
She's so independent, isn't she?

767
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:43,660
 What do you think? Isn't our Ah Rin so pretty?

768
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,860
 You could've taken revenge on just me.

769
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,580
 Why did you do that to Sun Yeong?

770
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,720
 Because you...

771
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,330
 took something precious from me first.

772
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,770
 I just did the exact same thing.

773
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,090
 You were interested in her daughter simply because

774
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,320
 she was someone precious to Seo Jae Won.

775
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,260
 She was just a trophy you wanted to steal.

776
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,940
 Arrivals

777
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:25,320
 Cute Ah Rin is leaving today. Goodbye, Ah Rin #ArrivingAt17:30.

778
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:37,260
 Passengers, we'll arrive at Incheon International Airport shortly.

779
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,840
 We'll arrive 30 minutes ahead of schedule due to the ideal weather.

780
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,320
 - I hope you had a pleasant flight.  
- Thank you.

781
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,390
 Thank you.

782
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,930
 Ladies and gentlemen...

783
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:52,710
 Cute Ah Rin is leaving today. Goodbye, Ah Rin #ArrivingAt17:30.

784
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,980
 Design Team Leader Yun Te Oh

785
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,840
 CEO, Ah Rin's arrival time was

786
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,130
mentioned on Rachel's social media. I think this is...

787
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,980
I know what you mean. I'm on my way right now.

788
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,480
- Should I come with you?
 - No.

789
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,400
I'll go check first.

790
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,240
 Okay.

791
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,620
Ah Rin.

792
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,520
Do you know her?

793
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,290
Yes. She's the pretty aunt.

794
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,850
Have you been well, my Ah Rin?

795
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,370
Yes.

796
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:19,980

797
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,660
â™«  I could fly to the moon  â™«

798
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,880
â™«  I could fly to the star  â™«

799
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:39,670
â™«  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  â™«

800
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,630
â™«  I could fly to the moon  â™«

801
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:47,640
â™«  I could fly to the star  â™«

802
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,460
â™«  There is a night like  â™«

803
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:56,950
â™«  a lie hidden within it  â™«

804
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:01,050
â™«  Following a darkened path  â™«

805
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,820
â™«  I walked aimlessly and just like that  â™«

806
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:11,660
â™«  Even if I'm abandoned in the world, will my heart feel better?  â™«

807
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:20,950
â™«  I'm standing at the crossroads where my future fate was determined  â™«

808
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,890
 My Happy Ending

809
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:29,400
 Kwon Yun Jin kidnapped CEO Seo Jae Won's daughter.

810
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,300
 Aren't you curious why Mom didn't tell you about Dad?

811
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:38,090
 I know I contacted you, but I didn't think I'd be able to meet you like this.

812
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,130
