Wow, this is so crazy.

11
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,270
Look, Jae Won. Isn't it fascinating?

12
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,350
It's our Ah Rin.

13
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,250
Ah Rin, it's Daddy.

14
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,080
Mommy came, too.

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,330
Yes, yes.

 Episode 3

19
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,600
- I'm not late, am I?
 - No.

20
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,910
Hello.

21
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,690
 J Department Store

22
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,900
I got a car ready outside.

23
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,170
I brought my car.

24
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,470
Would you be able to drive?

25
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,210
 I thought I knew everything about him.

26
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,670
Because he's Ah Rin's dad.

27
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,810
Because...

28
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,270
we're a family.

29
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,650
But I don't know anymore.

30
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,260
- Yellow.
 - Wow.

31
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,850
 - What did I know about him? 
 - This is a tough one.

32
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,630
Here we go. One... One, two, three.

33
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,850
- Elephant.
 - Whoa.

34
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,230
Why are you so good, Ah Rin? Why? You're amazing.

35
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,910
Who do you take after that you're so smart?

36
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,150
Mom.

37
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm so sad.

38
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,550
I'll go play my game since I got everything right.

39
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,940
Only 30 minutes. I checked the time.

40
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,060
Okay!

41
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,370
Oh, you came.

42
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,810
Hey.

43
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,840
You look tired.

44
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,930
Maybe it's because I've been tense all day. I'm tired.

45
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,630
I had an important meeting today.

46
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,430
It was about joining J Department Store.

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,700
I see.

48
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,600
So, did the meeting go well?

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,520
It wasn't bad. It was okay.

50
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,950
How was today? Not much happened?

51
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,350
Not much, you know.

52
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, I saw the dean earlier today.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,470
I think I'll start lecturing next semester.

54
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,170
That's a good idea.

55
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,780
It's been boring being home all the time.

56
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes, but I think it might've been a good thing.

57
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,730
Seeing Ah Rin growing fast made me feel sad.

58
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,100
The couples' gathering next week got canceled.

59
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,300
- Why all of a sudden?
 - Yeong Seon's husband cheated on her.

60
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,720
I guess they're getting divorced.

61
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,670
H-How's Yeong Seon? Is she okay?

62
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,140
It must be really hard.

63
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,900
Can you imagine how that must feel?

64
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,290
 Are you okay?

65
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,570
I'm not okay. I want to stomp on him.

66
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,610
I want to kill them both.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,490
 Now I won't restrain myself any longer.

68
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,460
Well, I don't really know—

69
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,410
It was hard for me to imagine since you'd never do that.

70
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,110
It's something that should never happen to our family.

71
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,720
Mom.

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,460
- Ah Rin.
 - You came.

73
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,860
Mom, let's play Poky Poky together.

74
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,620
I got really good at it.

75
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,220
Shall we? Let's see how good you are.

76
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,960
 Find the same one.

77
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,550
Gosh, you're good.

78
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,880
Ah Rin.

79
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,380
Yes?

80
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,190
Where did you go with Dad earlier today?

81
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,230
Earlier today? Well, we went to see Dad's friend.

82
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,900
Which friend?

83
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,710
I don't know. We didn't get to meet.

84
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,320
Why not?

85
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,010
Oh, boy...

86
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,670
Gosh.

87
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,850
Dad, what's wrong?

88
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,910
Aigoo, I don't think this is the place.

89
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,660
They sent the wrong address.

90
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,210
Oh, my God.

91
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,990
Oh, my God.

92
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,190
It's your turn now. Hurry up.

93
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,330
Oh, okay.

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,250
It would've been nice if you could've met Oppa today.

95
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,850
I'll let him know that you waited for him before you left.

96
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,640
See you. Good night.

97
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
Good night.

98
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,970
Gosh, you scared me.

99
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,120
Hey, what took you so long? I waited for you.

100
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,180
We need to talk.

101
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,220
I'll have this.

102
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,130
Don't drink too much coffee.

103
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,270
You can't sleep at night.

104
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,660
This is so nice.

105
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,280
This reminds me of when we were in college in the US.

106
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,870
Right?

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,810
It was so nice back then.

108
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,060
We talked about art all night, drinking beer in the studio.

109
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,750
Te Oh, why don't we—

110
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,960
Let's stop, Seonbae.

111
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,930
Stop doing what you're doing.

112
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,920
Since when did you know?

113
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,380
I was looking for furniture to put in the hotel rooms.

114
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,480
I'll get back soon.

115
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay.

116
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,160
I know what you're thinking right now,

117
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,270
but it's not like that.

118
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,690
The man I'm seeing isn't Jae Won's husband.

119
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,040
 Headache

120
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,730
- You're going to work early. 
 - Yes.

121
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,420
Hand me a cup, too.

122
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,850
Thank you.

123
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,070
Ah Rin needs to go to kindergarten early for the art class today.

124
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,120
She's not home right now.

125
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,570
I sent her to the kids' camp.

126
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,090
- How about kindergarten?
 - I'm not letting her go there for now.

127
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,820
What is it now?

128
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,100
Geez...

129
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,440
She must've thrown a tantrum that she doesn't want to go.

130
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,500
- I'll try talking to her. 
 - I pulled her out of there.

131
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,260
She'll take lessons at home from now on. I got her a teacher, too.

132
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,100
Without discussing it with me at all?

133
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,770
Did you do that after discussing it with me?

134
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,800
Hey.

135
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,950
Hello.

136
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,080
 Derêve | casamia

137
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,980
 Derêve

138
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,900
What do you think?

139
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,870
The CEO has to like it.

140
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,130
Would you start over if I said I didn't like it?

141
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,410
You...

142
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,960
think you came this far because you're all that, huh?

143
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,700
You've always been this way.

144
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,600
You pretend that you care and worry about people,

145
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,150
but you actually enjoy it.

146
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,600
You're showing off your success by keeping me by your side.

147
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,490
That's just your insecurity.

148
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
Let's just say it is.

149
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,020
It must be my fault since I'm inferior to you.

150
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,900
I've pitied you sometimes.

151
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,440
I wanted to help you secretly, too.

152
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Because I thought you were my friend, then.

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,140
Because I believed that you were different from other people.

154
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,200
You destroyed my faith in you. What are you doing now?

155
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,420
Are you complaining?

156
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,380
Do you want me to comfort you or something?

157
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,830
- You're saying that because— 
 - So keep your mouth shut.

158
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,150
Stop playing the victim.

159
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,960
Yes.

160
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,760
 Copy of Medical Record

161
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,000
That's your mother's medical history.

162
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,640
I met the doctor who worked in the ER that day today.

163
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,280
 Hyeonwon Life Insurance 
 Nam Tae Ju

164
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,110
Do you remember this person by chance?

165
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,410
 Insurance Policyholder

166
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,810
This patient died a while ago, as I understand.

167
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,600
Is there something wrong?

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,700
It's just that there's an unresolved issue.

169
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,180
Do you remember when Ms. Jeong came into the ER?

170
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,370
I don't remember the details, but I do.

171
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,330
She was sent here three times.

172
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,990
Oh, actually, it was four times.

173
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,690
Although she was already dead the last time.

174
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,100
 Emergency Room, Emergency entrance

175
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,110
 EMT

176
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,960
One, two, three.

177
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,480
She drank pesticide. Get ready to pump her stomach right now.

178
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,500
- Where's her guardian?
 - Right here.

179
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,040
Sir, what did she drink?

180
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,410
Which pesticide did she take?

181
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,950
- Sir! 
 - Yes? It was a mistake.

182
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,270
She took it thinking it was water.

183
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,520
 She said the same thing when she regained consciousness.

184
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,180
 That she drank it by mistake.

185
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,500
Ms. Jeong died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

186
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Can you die from that after taking pesticide?

187
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,110
Yes, it's possible.

188
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,020
Were you not suspicious, then?

189
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,900
It never made sense that she took it by mistake.

190
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,470
If she took it repeatedly,

191
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,810
she either took it to commit suicide, or someone gave it to her to kill her.

192
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,080
Why did he say it was a mistake both times?

193
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,530
Where should I take you?

194
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,570
Let me take the car. You can go home now.

195
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,420
 A group of people who gambled at a fish farm in a secluded part of the city got arrested.

196
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,030
 Most of the ones arrested were housewives.

197
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,610
 It was a so-called housewives' gambling club.

198
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,330
 The police found stacks of cash in the fish farm during the raid.

199
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,880
 - Millions were being wagered... 
 - What on earth...

200
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,290
- Gosh.
  - Ten people were arrested at the scene and

201
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,420
 - to arrest the suspects at the scene,  
 - It's mine.

202
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,650
 -the police took four...  
 - Look at this.

203
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,630
Gosh! My gosh!

204
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,770
My goodness!

205
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,260
It was you, wasn't it?

206
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,640
Don't deny it.

207
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,470
You lie with a straight face, just like your mother.

208
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,500
Why do you come here every day with no money?

209
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,100
Did your mom promise to get you a pretty doll with gambling money?

210
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,520
 School study materials

211
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,040
Are you okay? You must've been scared.

212
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,070
Let's just go.

213
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,790
Where are you going?

214
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,470
Where do you think you're going? You need to pay me for this.

215
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,600
The boys who were there did it. Why are you blaming my daughter?

216
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,100
No, not that.

217
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,040
Did you do that?

218
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,210
I used to do that, too, Yun Jin.

219
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
It happens to everyone. Don't worry.

220
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Jae Won.

221
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Dad.

222
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,670
You came.

223
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,860
If you had told me in advance, I would've picked up your favorite fruits at the market.

224
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,120
- It's okay.
 - It won't take long. I'll be right back.

225
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,100
Dad.

226
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,000
Dad, have a seat. I need to talk to you.

227
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Let me just pick it up real quick.

228
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,460
Have a seat.

229
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,780
Someone from an insurance company came by.

230
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,440
Regarding the insurance payment for Mom.

231
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,950
Were you aware of it?

232
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,610
Where's the money? Where did you hide it?

233
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,120
 She left home whenever she got money due to her gambling addiction.

234
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,430
 Trying to teach her a lesson,

235
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,490
 I hid the bank book, jewelry, and everything.

236
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,560
 And she threatened to kill herself.

237
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,750
Don't do it!

238
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll drink this and die.

239
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,560
- Do as you'd like, then!
 - Give me the money!

240
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,670
 I was fooled by her bluffing countless times.

241
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,230
Don't do it!

242
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,300
 I told her to do as she'd like. I guess she felt provoked.

243
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,980
 She actually drank the pesticide.

244
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,100
 Gosh, I was so shocked.

245
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,320
I gave her everything she wanted so she wouldn't get hurt.

246
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,830
I got her a loan if she was short, too.

247
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,600
But I guess she thought it worked.

248
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,800
She threatened to die by taking the pesticide whenever she ran out of money.

249
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,300
She drank it again if it didn't work and was taken to the hospital again.

250
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,420
And she threatened me again after surviving.

251
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,950
She did that multiple times.

252
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,490
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,510
You should've told me.

254
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,420
After you took care of her her whole life?

255
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,920
When your business was finally succeeding

256
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,620
and you were finally smiling after being freed from her?

257
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,560
Right around that time,

258
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,570
someone told me I could collect insurance money.

259
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,260
I paid off all of her debts with that.

260
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,920
And I got a small apartment with the rest of it.

261
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,450
I thought I shouldn't leech off you and my son-in-law later in life.

262
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,460
Did I do the wrong thing?

263
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,070
No.

264
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,750
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

265
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,400
Who told you that you could get insurance money?

266
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,260
Was it Sun Yeong?

267
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,910
How did you know?

268
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,950
We decided not to tell her since you would've worried.

269
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,830
Does he also know that Mom was sent to the ER after taking pesticide?

270
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,400
Yes.

271
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,650
There's no change.

272
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,680
Administer the antidote.

273
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,070
- Father.
 - Hey.

274
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,960
The antidote was injected.

275
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,250
Don't worry so much.

276
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,190
She'll be okay.

277
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,390
There was an intruder that day, and he tried to threaten Ms. Seo?

278
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,930
Why are things so quiet, then? We need to get the police involved immediately.

279
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,310
There's a bit of a situation.

280
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,900
What situation? What if it happens again?

281
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,600
We need to find him before it does.

282
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,010
I want to find him and find out why he did that.

283
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,200
I want to know why he tried to frame me.

284
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,020
What are you talking about now?

285
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,640
By the way, how would you find him?

286
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,800
I thought the CCTVs were undergoing a test.

287
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,490
To be honest...

288
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,510
 You mean the culprit was captured on it?

289
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,810
No.

290
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,320
It was recording, but it cut off before the culprit showed up.

291
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,870
I think a part of the file was lost.

292
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,880
I'm sure it can be recovered if it happened while saving.

293
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,210
Let's try running the program.

294
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,510
Doesn't it feel like we're in a crime investigation show or something?

295
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,210
The culprit is...

296
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,280
 Derêve design team 
 Yun Te Oh

297
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,880
Where did all the team members go?

298
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,580
Two of them are working offsite. One of them was a no-show.

299
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,330
No-show?

300
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,210
I know. Why did he disappear after the meeting?

301
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,440
- Hello, Team Leader.
 - Hello.

302
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
It worked.

303
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,560
 Report something...

304
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,340
 This is...

305
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,160
 Where are you located, ma'am?

306
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,740
 Hello? Hello?

307
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,060
 Hello, CEO.

308
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,600
 That's so crazy.

309
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,450
 I didn't think she'd come to work for a while.

310
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,000
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

311
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,500
Where's Baek Seung Gyu right now?

312
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,800
Why are you asking me about him?

313
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,180
I know you two are dating.

314
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,870
Do you know where he is or not?

315
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,610
H-How did you know that—

316
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,110
That's not important right now. We need to find him immediately.

317
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,840
It has to do with the CEO.

318
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,840
What does she have to do with Seung Gyu—

319
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,250
What is it?

320
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,230
- Could it be—
- Seriously, what is it?

321
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,770
He said he'd go to Wonju for an emergency.

322
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,860
But the CEO also went to Wonju to meet her father.

323
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,450
Jae Won.

324
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,110
- Let's eat.
 - Okay.

325
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,300
 Team Leader Yun Te Oh

326
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,700
 CEO Seo Jae Won

327
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,310
Go inside. Don't skip meals, okay?

328
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,860
Okay. Drive safely.

329
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,520
Honey!

330
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,820
 Danger: Under Construction

331
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,890
- CEO! 
 - Yun Te Oh! Te Oh!

332
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,660
What's going on, CEO?

333
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,590
The brakes aren't working!

334
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,710
The car won't stop!

335
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,790
Yun Te Oh! Yun Te Oh!

336
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:09,910

337
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,670
Are you okay?

338
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,500
Are you hurt?

339
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,080
Don't look at it.

340
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,340
They think there's an issue with the brake pad.

341
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,150
It was totally fine a few hours ago.

342
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,320
How about the dashcam?

343
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,290
It was turned off. Didn't you know?

344
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,670
It's not the car I usually drive.

345
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,320
By chance...

346
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,130
were you planning to see someone today or...

347
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,080
It's nothing. I called a taxi. It will be here soon.

348
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:50,080
 He was adopted by a US family as a kid and came to Korea four years ago. Is that right?

349
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,080
 That's right. But it wasn't his first time four years ago.

350
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,230
 There's a record of him entering the country seven years ago, too.

351
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,330
By the way...

352
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,300
how did you know I was here?

353
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,310
Later.

354
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,170
I'll tell you when everything gets clarified later.

364
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,570
Go inside and get some sleep. Try not to think at all.

365
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,910
I can't trust you completely yet.

366
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,000
I can't trust anyone right now.

367
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,970
Not even myself. So...

368
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,500
Thank you.

00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,260
 I really have no idea now.

377
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,100
 How am I supposed to endure this day?

378
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:20,190

 Ambulance

385
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,250
My goodness. Is he dead?

386
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,290
- What do we do? 
 - What's going on?

387
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,350
Someone fell from the rooftop of this building.

388
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,210
My gosh. Looks pretty bad.

389
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,380
 Grandpa, me, Dad

390
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,150
You were still up.

391
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,540
 Grandpa, me, Dad

392
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,690
I...

393
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,240
I guess I'm...

394
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,620
very sensitive these days.

395
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,740
Jae Won.

396
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,330
You can take a break if it's difficult.

397
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,160
I'll help you.

398
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm going to bed.

00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,240
The Chairman will be here soon.

401
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,080
What kind of tea would you like?

402
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm fine.

 2019 Mirae Social Contribution Awards

405
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,960
Chairman, I heard that you're resigning as the director of Derêve.

406
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,580
I decided to do that because I thought it was time to focus on the foundation.

407
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,080
Isn't it because you're aiming for something bigger?

408
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,820
There's a rumor that you'd be nominated as the minister of the Ministry of Culture.

409
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,850
Really? There's a rumor like that?

410
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:46,870
Don't be like that. We'll keep it off the record until it becomes official.

411
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,680
Well, it's been almost 30 years...

412
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,330
since I started a relationship with the Yein Foundation.

413
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,930
It costs a lot of money to study art.

414
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,450
It'd be nice to be fully supported by wealthy parents,

415
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,240
but that's not up to you to decide.

416
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,130
The adults should help poor students so they can live their dreams, too.

417
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,790
That's what I do.

418
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,230
Didn't you come today to help with that, too?

419
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,590
Well, sure.

420
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,970
Okay.

421
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,400
Who's the most memorable

422
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,390
scholarship student in the past 30 years?

423
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,010
Is it the one we all know of?

424
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,380
 Seo Jae Won, the seventh scholarship recipient

425
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,870
It is CEO Seo.

426
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,520
She was maybe 15 years old then.

427
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,600
She wanted to study art and came with a recommendation. I could tell immediately

428
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,280
that she wasn't an ordinary kid.

429
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,740
The qualities you see in kids in need.

430
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,700
Determination and tenacity. Stuff like that.

431
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,610
Long time no see, Chairman.

432
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:09,660
Have a seat. I think we'll have a lot to talk about.

433
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,350
Should I, then?

434
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,770
 Yein Arts Scholarship Foundation Chairman Kwon Yeong Ik

435
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,090
Hello.

436
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,810
CEO, the meeting is set up.

437
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,150
Okay.

438
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,560
 010-216-1264

439
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,530
 Remember that day seven years ago?

440
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,530
 Operating Center

441
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,110
Are you Mr. Baek's guardian?

442
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,300
Is the operation finished?

443
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,690
Not yet. He was injured everywhere, from head to toe.

444
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:14,110
He luckily survived since he got caught in a tree.

445
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:19,590
I found the phone in his jacket while undressing him.

446
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,160
Thank you.

447
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,770
 Hey, hello?

448
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,520
 Seung Gyu, what happened?

449
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,480
 I asked what happened? Why won't you answer?

450
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,700
 Baek Seung Gyu

451
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,610
Hello?

452
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:16,140
 Heo Sun Yeong

453
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,470
 As the technology continues to get developed,

454
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,500
 we won't stop researching integrated design.

455
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,090
 To do that, not just design-forward thinking...

456
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,700
CEO.

457
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,150
Hey.

458
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,740
Should I get the car ready?

459
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,790
You can go home. I'll get some more work done.

460
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,570
You know there's a conference tomorrow, right?

461
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,140
Yes.

462
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,630
Is there anything else you need—

463
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,410
No.

464
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,940
I'll get going, then.

465
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,430
Sure.

466
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,350
 I put the paperwork delivered from the office in the study.

467
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,910
 Did I do the wrong thing?

468
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,440
 No.

469
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,930
 Where did you go with Dad earlier today?

470
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,630
 Earlier today?

471
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,550
 We went to see Dad's friend.

472
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,240
 - Which friend?
 - I don't know. We didn't get to meet.

473
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,420
 By the way, how did you know I was here?

474
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,020
 Later.

475
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,040
 I'll tell you when everything

476
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,030
 gets clarified later.

477
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,660
 Headache

478
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,550
 Headache

479
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,950
 How is our room?

480
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,890
 Jae Won, I don't know why you're like this lately.

481
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,470
 Remember that day seven years ago?

482
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:04,240
I sincerely thank you for coming to Derêve's first launch event.

483
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,370
 Headache

484
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,990
 Derêve 
 Kyla Launch Press Briefing

485
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:30,200
Of course. Reporter Choi goes wherever Seo Jae Won goes.

486
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,870
Yes, Professor Heo.

487
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:56,030
Oh, I see. Ms. Seo can't go home because she's so busy with work.

488
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,190
I'm sorry.

489
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:02,160
Yes. I'll tell her to make sure to go home tonight.

490
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,470
Yes, got it.

491
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,230
Did you get a hold of her?

492
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,790
No.

493
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:09,720
She didn't go home last night, apparently.

494
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,090
I wonder where she is.

495
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,950
How about the hotel? Did you call her there?

496
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,830
She won't answer.

497
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,690
Isn't she here yet?

498
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,600
Please wait a little longer.

499
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,410
We have less than 30 minutes left.

500
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,840
Shouldn't you come up with a different solution?

501
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,440
- I'm sorry.
 - CEO.

502
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,640
I'm sorry. I...

503
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,440
I lost track of time and was sketching all night, and I was going to take a shower, but—

504
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,060
CEO, you need to get changed and get ready.

505
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,220
- Yes, of course.
 - CEO Seo arrived.

506
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,300
Please check the cue sheet.

507
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,540
Yes, it's me.

508
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,430
Hello, we welcome the reporters to the launch event for

509
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,090
Derêve, the furniture that makes your family happy.

510
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:41,540
 I'm Oh Yeong Jun, the host for today.

511
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,260
Drink this.

512
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,010
I'm okay.

513
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,740
I... I didn't get enough sleep. I'm just tired.

514
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,370
No, I'm not tired. I just don't feel so good.

515
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,960
Anyway, everything is fine. Okay?

516
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,150
I've been on stage countless times.

517
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,930
Where was it last time?

518
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,970
Busan. When we opened a store in Busan, the conference...

519
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,050
I need to check out the Busan store sometime.

520
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:23,560
I'll introduce you to the one you've been waiting for.

521
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,510
CEO, time to get on stage.

522
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,360
Don't go.

523
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,750
Yes. Thank you for waiting.

524
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:03,110
Please welcome Derêve's Director Park In Seok to present for us today.

525
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,000
 - What?
- It's not Seo Jae Won?

526
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,850
 Derêve 
 Kyla Launch Press Briefing

527
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:24,910
I'm happy to present the project I've been working on since the planning stage...

528
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,170
What are you doing right now?

529
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,930
Don't you know how important this event is to me?

530
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,030
I'm doing this because I know.

531
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,730
- Move.
 - I'm not going to.

532
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,430
Why are you doing this to me?

533
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,900
Chairwoman.

534
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,750
Is it fun stabbing me in the back after pretending to be thoughtful and caring?

535
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,270
Please calm down.

536
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,710
You got me to suspect you by always being somewhere you're not supposed to be.

537
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,120
Have you decided to show your true colors now?

538
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,290
Has this been your goal?

539
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,380
- Please stop.
 - What do you mean stop?

540
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,390
Why don't you stop? Just why are you doing this to me—

541
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,340
Why...

542
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,200
Why are you plaguing me so much?

543
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,540
Why are you ruining my work?

544
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,400
Today's...

545
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,190
Today's...

546
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,930
Conference. Conference...

547
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,370
That's enough, I said. Please.

548
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,780
Did you take the medicine today?

549
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,200
That medicine...

550
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,630
You didn't take the headache medicine, did you?

551
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,200
Who are you?

552
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,290
 Psychiatrist Jo Su Gyeong

553
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,170
What time is it?

554
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,780
It's a little past 10. How are you feeling?

555
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,190
I'm okay.

556
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,850
Since when have you not slept?

557
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:48,030
I didn't feel tired even after staying up all night. So I thought I didn't need to sleep.

558
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,990
Why didn't you take the medicine?

559
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,530
I couldn't really focus.

560
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,380
I didn't want to keep relying on the medicine, either.

561
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,800
I've experienced addiction and side effects, too.

562
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,870
But you can't just skip it.

563
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:09,360
I said you'd be fine if you kept taking the correct dose on time.

564
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,380
There was an important presentation.

565
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,310
I thought a few days would be fine.

566
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,980
I think Te Oh knows.

567
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,350
That I have bipolar disorder.

568
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:53,220
What happened to the other bow?

569
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,420
You still look pretty.

570
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,630
What?

571
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:05,040
I was supposed to play Bingo with Do Yun.

572
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,070
You can hang out after the kindergarten gets out, no?

573
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,580
My teacher said we'd have a snack party

574
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,930
if we collected 30 compliment stickers.

575
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,020
I just need to collect two more.

576
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,880
It's just temporary.

577
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,040
What does "temporary" mean?

578
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,890
Well...

579
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,590
I'll let you go after just ten nights.

580
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,500
- Are you sure?
 - Yeah.

581
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,950
I promise you. For real.

582
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,780
Thank you for letting me, Mom.

583
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,780
You're so sweet, my princess.

584
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,530
Dad!

585
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,860
Aigoo, my baby. Come here.

586
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,950
Let's eat. Come here.

587
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:59,600
It looks tasty.

588
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,710
One, two, three. Okay. Here we go.

589
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,020
Eat before you go.

590
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,190
Don't go out with Ah Rin.

591
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,280
I'm not asking you.

592
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,210
Ah Rin, I'm leaving.

593
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,940
See you later.

594
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,940
You need to eat a lot.

595
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,430
Ah Rin's mom.

596
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,610
How have you been?

597
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,020
Are you going to work?

598
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,720
Yes. Everything's good, right?

599
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,360
Of course. We're fine.

600
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,940
Is Ah Rin's dad home?

601
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,360
Pardon?

602
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,840
I ran into him while taking a walk here recently.

603
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,230
I thought it was kind of strange.

604
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,840
 He's always friendly and says hello first.

605
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:26,250
 We even made eye contact that day, but he walked away as if he didn't know me.

606
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,080
My gosh. Did you have another car?

607
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,280
It's not the same one you had then.

608
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:50,010

609
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,500
 Just this once.

610
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,200
 I'm serious. I'm serious this time. I won't do it this time. Just this once...

611
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,140
 - One, two... 
 - CEO.

612
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,330
- Yes.
  - Three, four...

613
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,780
- Honey.
  - Five...

614
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,710
What's wrong?

615
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,600
 Hurry, Dad!

616
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,810
 Hurry up!

617
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,120
Hey, Jae Won!

618
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,100
Jae Won!

619
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,900
♫  I can fly to the moon  ♫

620
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,190
♫  I can fly to the stars  ♫

621
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:50,870
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

622
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,770
♫  I can fly to the moon  ♫

623
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:58,830
♫  I can fly to the stars  ♫

624
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:02,800
♫  There is a night like a lie   ♫

625
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,210
♫   hidden within it  ♫

626
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:16,070
♫  Following a darkened path I walked aimlessly  ♫

627
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:22,870
♫  even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better  ♫

628
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,760
♫  I'm standing at the crossroads  ♫

629
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,800
 My Happy Ending

630
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,600
 I mean your older brother who went missing.

631
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,330
 How come you never thought about looking for him?

632
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,900
 We need to find him before it's too late.

633
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,280
 I guess he suffered from a disease.

634
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,380
 He never mentioned having a younger brother, either.

635
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,990
 The name on the profile is Heo Chi Yeong.

636
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:46,990
 Where can I meet Heo Chi Yeong?

637
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,710
 They asked for it in a rush. I didn't get to bring it up.

638
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,310
 Yun Jin is seeing someone.

639
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,700
 Someone like Professor Heo.

640
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,900
 Congratulations, Yun Jin.

641
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,060
 Tell me everything you're hiding from me.

642
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,920
 All of you will be shocked.

643
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,060
♫  There is a night like a lie   ♫
