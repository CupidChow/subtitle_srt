Ms. Seo has been absent from work often and

364
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,920
has canceled important meetings.

There have been complaints among employees.

Well, that's-

I didn't mean it like that.

374

What do you think of the fried rice I made?

379
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,400
It's not too bad.

380
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,310
Not too bad? Is that it?

You're hurting my feelings.

382

I'm sorry, I can't lie.

No, no, no. It's a great thing that you don't lie.

396

You like Dad a lot more than Mom, right?

398
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,520
I don't think so. You like Mom more, right?

399

I don't think so. You tell us, Ah Rin.

401
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,130
You prefer Mom, right?

- Well done.

You're a family of entertainers.

That's good to hear.

So I was thinking...

423
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:42,630
maybe we could show more of the father playing with Ah Rin.

424
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,510
We can air for two weeks if we get enough footage.

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,160
Sounds good. Let's do that.

Okay.

431
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:10,070
I can go by myself. Please stay and keep an eye on them.

432
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,070

Hello, Ms. Seo. I'm Park Yong Jin, your new driver.

The police already took the CCTV files.

436

Could you tell me when that was?

437
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,760
The same day the man from the fifth floor fell.

438
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,020

No. They asked for it in a rush. I didn't get to bring it up.

Do you know how the investigation is going?

511
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,130
Would they be able to catch the culprit?

512
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,640
Do you think there's a culprit?

513
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,470

He struggled with pain while he was here,

542
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,460
but he seemed more hurt by the fact that his family abandoned him.

543
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,830

545
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,230
Don't tell Secretary Kim about what Baek Seung Gyu did.

546
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,540
The fact that a loved one has another side of them

547
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,080
will make anyone go through hell.

548
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,820
You think not knowing is okay?

549
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,760
Even though she won't know his true self?

550
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,550
No matter how close you are to someone,

551
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,810
you can't know everything.

552
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:46,740
Even married couples who share a blanket have secrets.

553
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,200
If nothing changes by knowing,

554
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,840
it's better not to know.

555
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,590
Have you tried to change?

556
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,040
Get away from reality if it's hellish.

Since we're on the topic,

why don't we revisit the factory expansion plan we paused last year?

563
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,710
I already got a lot of investment offers.

564
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,250
Okay. I'll look into it.

Who wants this?

Ah Rin, isn't that your mom?

569
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,960
No, it's not.

570
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,510
My mom is really busy.

571
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,250
No, it's her.

572
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,770
I saw her on TV.

573
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,290
It's not her, I said.

Gosh! Daebak.

Aigoo, yes. What did you do?

577
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,660
Did you play with the sand?

578
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,990
Ah Rin. Grandpa is almost here.

579
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:58,430
I'll go fishing with Grandpa.

580
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,400
I'll catch a huge fish, Mom.

581
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,050
I'll be looking forward to it. Have fun.

Okay. I'll see her off.

00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,550
I'll be right back.

How did you find my place?

589
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,320
I told Mr. Kwon that I wanted to treat him to dinner.

590
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,460
He gave me your address so I can bring you, too.

591
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,820
Wait here. I'll talk to him for a second.

592
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,220
Why?

593
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,680
Will you tell him we had a falling out?

594
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,300
He'd be disappointed.

595
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,860
That's what you hate the most.

596
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,870
Disappointing your father.

597
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,380
It's been so long, Jae Won.

598
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,390
I'm sorry. I should've visited you more often.

599
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,330
It's okay. We know how busy you are.

Where's Mr. Kwon?

601
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,620
He said he's almost here.

602
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,190
Honey.

603
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,440
I'm sorry. Am I too late?

Dean Choi said she could look forward to getting hired as a full-time professor this time.

606
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,940
Dean Choi from Yoon Jin's school?

607
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,480
It must've been difficult persuading him.

608
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,010
Yoon Jin has been an assistant professor for a long time.

609
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,280
Gosh, that's so wonderful.

610
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,590
Aren't you helping her too much?

611
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,770
Does she even deserve it?

612
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,120
Gosh, come on, Honey.

613
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,090
You did the same for me.

614
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,240
When I was in middle school,

615
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,450
you had faith in me, supported me, and invested in me.

616
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,450
It's for the same reason.

617
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,920
The same reason?

618
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,520
Is she holding something over your head?

619
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,910
Pardon?

620
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,680
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

621
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,840
I loved the look in your eyes then.

622
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,520
Shouldn't we get a bottle of champagne?

623
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,870
I ordered it already.

624
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,940
Excuse me.

625
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,240
Where are you?

626
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,780
Okay. Hurry up.

627
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,270
Is someone coming?

628
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,850
You should've given me a heads-up.

629
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,080
What happened to the other bow?

630
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,880
You still look pretty.

631
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,560
You mean the video was edited?

632
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,470
Please have a look at this.

633
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,720
What's this?

634
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,340
It's Heo Chi Yeong's medical history.

635
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,790
He would've suffered without a respirator in this condition.

636
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,050
When was the last time you talked to him?

637
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,540
I don't know. I don't even remember.

638
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:27,910
I haven't talked to him since I was 13, when my parents divorced. It's been 30 years since I talked to him.

639
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,740
So, where's Mr. Heo right now?

640
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,380
He passed away last year.

641
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,840
His younger brother came and even had a funeral. You had no idea?

642
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,310
I invited him.

643
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,700
We should all celebrate this happy occasion.

644
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,830
It's okay, right?

645
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,510
Of course.

646
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,990
- Professor Heo.
- Yes.

647
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:16,410
Didn't you walk by our foundation office recently?

648
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,500
Your office?

649
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,990
No.

650
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,870
Maybe you were mistaken.

651
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,700
Really?

652
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:28,020
You could've said he was your twin.

653
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,770
Are you sure it wasn't you?

654
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,410
Come on. Not you, too.

655
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,490
Have you been well, Ma'am?

656
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,350
You got even more handsome.

657
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,900
Thank you.

658
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,050
Long time no see, Yoon Jin.

659
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,040
Yes. Hello.

660
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,770
I think Yoon Jin get promoted as a full-time professor soon.

661
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,550
You should congratulate her, too.

662
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,690
Is that why you told me to pick up champagne?

663
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,520
Congratulations, Yoon Jin.

664
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,640
Thank you.

665
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,820
Shall we drink, then?

666
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,590
Cheers.

667
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,790
Yoon Jin needs to find someone like Professor Heo, too.

668
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,980
Don't worry. She's already seeing him.

669
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,540
What did you say?

670
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,540
Someone like Professor Heo, I mean.

671
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,630
She's dating someone.

672
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,010
Is that true?

673
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,930
Should I not have said it?

674
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,540
Haven't you told them yet?

675
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,400
Well, we're just...

676
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,790
dating casually.

677
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,900
Introduce us some time.

678
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,380
One, two, three.

679
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,600
Thank you.

680
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,890
You must be tired. Go take a shower.

681
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,330
Okay.

682
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,970
Who's been calling you?

683
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,710
It's a friend.

684
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,260
Sang Won.

685
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:14,760
He keeps asking me to join him for a drink.

686
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,290
I'll have to step out for a second.

687
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,200
This late?

688
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,990
Yes. I guess he's really drunk.

689
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,770
I'll be right back. He keeps calling me.

690
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,210
Who does he want to see so badly?

691
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,530
Heo Soon Yeong?

692
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,560
Heo Chi Yeong?

693
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,640
Or both?

694
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,920

706
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,950
How about the custody?

707
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,730
The husband is mostly in charge of childcare.

708
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,870
