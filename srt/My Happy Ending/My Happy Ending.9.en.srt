- Don't you think?
- What are you talking about?

You got home safely that night, right?

182
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,490
I don't think I should've said those things. I felt kind of bad.

183
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,560
That's enough, Yun Jin.

184
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,700
You knew from the beginning, didn't you?

185
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,700
You knew everything, but you pretended to worry about me,

186
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,290
and you kept fishing for information by bringing up the past I didn't remember.

187
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,730
What's the reason?

188
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,910
I was wondering, but...

189
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,640
it looks like you don't have your memory back.

190
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,410
Yes. This is Seo Jae Won.

191
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,770
This is your method.

192
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,020
You scrape everything and run away if you can't handle it.

193
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,040
You did that when you were 15,

194
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,800
seven years ago,

195
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,470
and even now...

196
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,160
You haven't changed at all.

197
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,670
Are you curious why I'm doing this?

198
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,440
Go ask your husband, then.

199
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,230
He knows better than anyone.

200
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,910
I'm sorry, but...

201
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,140
I no longer...

202
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,650
have trust in you.

203
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,880
Are you sure you won't regret saying that

204
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,490
when you get your memory back?

205
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,300
I'm not sure. How about you?

206
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,960
Would you be able to handle it...

207
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,340
when all of my memory comes back?

208
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,750
[010-071-3520]

209
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,240
Hello?

210
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,670
Who did you say you are?

211
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,410
- Hello, Ahjussi.
- Hi.

212
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,410
You've been well, right?

213
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,190
You must be surprised I suddenly reached out.

214
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,370
Not at all. Everything's good, right?

215
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,270
I'm doing well.

216
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,200
I heard you painted for Jae Won's company and helped her a lot.

217
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,670
Thank you, Yun Jin.

218
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,680
Ahjussi...

219
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,550
you haven't changed.

220
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,270
What made you call me, by the way?

221
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,900
I was just wondering...

222
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,610
I wanted to ask you something.

223
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,910
I was wondering if Jae Won or Sun Yeong were...

224
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,610
going through something I don't know about.

225
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm sorry, Ahjussi.

226
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,170
It's all my fault.

227
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,610
You?

228
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,740
What do you mean...

229
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,490
Father, what brings you here without notice-

230
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,300
How could you...

231
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,350
How could you do that with Jae Won's friend, of all people?

232
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Have you been playing innocent next to Jae Won after doing something so shameless?

234
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,210
You've been so good to her. Why did you do that?

235
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,310
Father, have some water.

236
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,090
Does Jae Won know, too?

237
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,640
She doesn't remember... yet.

238
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,470
What will you do from now on?

239
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,360
Since she found out she doesn't remember,

240
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,700
she's been very anxious.

241
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,740
Until she settles down and gets her memory back...

242
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,930
I want to stay by her side until then.

243
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,860
I'll ask for forgiveness after that.

244
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,660
What if she wants to break up then?

245
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,390
I'll...

246
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,370
have to do what she wants then.

247
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,300
I can't tell her.

248
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,370
I can tell she's barely holding on in the storm right now.

249
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,200
How could I possibly...

250
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,150
Sun Yeong.

251
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,570
Yes, Father.

252
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,960
Let's say it never happened.

253
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,430
Her memory might not come back.

254
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,180
She doesn't remember what happened when she was 15, either.

255
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,310
You don't want to lose her, either, right?

256
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
So...

257
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,170
let's cover it up and move on.

258
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,870
Knock, knock.

259
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,490
You haven't gone home yet?

260
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,500
Yeah, I needed to check something.

261
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,580
We have a meeting with J Department Store tomorrow.

262
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,220
Didn't they report to you?

263
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,830
I put together the sales report and presentation for the meeting and sent them along.

264
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,220
I received them. I wanted to check one more time.

265
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,100
It's an important client.

266
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,590
We can't make mistakes.

267
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,920
Let's look at them together, then.

268
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,090
Why would you?

269
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,340
Because it's an important client.

270
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,590
You don't have to.

271
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,170
Give that to me. Seriously.

272
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,880
I'll tell you everything, including what you don't remember.

273
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,670
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

274
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,910
I'm not sure what I've done exactly.

275
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,100
I just have no idea.

276
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,600
I even framed my husband for leaking our design to get custody.

277
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,810
What else couldn't I do?

278
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,830
You're already doing something terrible right now.

279
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,250
You're working overtime and making the employees feel guilty.

280
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,530
Just look at me right now.

281
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,370
This is a huge deal, okay?

282
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,510
I met Professor Heo recently.

283
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,340
Sun Yeong?

284
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,700
I don't know about anything else,

285
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,890
but it definitely seemed like he didn't want you to get hurt.

286
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,510
So, why don't you trust him and wait for him?

287
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,610
Thank you, Te Oh.

288
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,990
Should I stay with you or leave?

289
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,190
Go and do your thing.

290
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,690
Okay.

291
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,440
Mom!

292
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,770
Ah Rin!

293
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,520
What brings you here?

294
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,610
She kept begging to see you.

295
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,220
Did you want to come see me?

296
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,590
No. I said we can't because you're busy,

297
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,300
but Dad begged me to visit you together.

298
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,370
We were supposed to keep that a secret, Ah Rin.

299
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,210
Right. I forgot.

300
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,010
Goodness...

301
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,710
Mom, who's that ahjussi?

302
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,240
Why are you alone with him?

303
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,680
Hi, Ah Rin.

304
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,870
I discussed work with Ms. Seo a bit.

305
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,750
I'll forgive you just once.

306
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,920
Thank you.

307
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,320
I'll get going now, then.

308
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,200
- Is this your desk?
- Yes.

309
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,040
It's huge. I want to try sitting here.

310
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,870
Okay. Here we go.

311
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,410
Secretary Heo, what's next on my schedule?

312
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,190
What's next?

313
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,980
Okay. Let's see.

314
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,880
The next thing is for us to go get dinner.

315
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay, let's go eat.

316
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,600
♫ Looking at the sky that's getting further away ♫

317
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,400
♫ I'm leaving without feeling regretful ♫

318
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:47,580
♫ So, how we appeared together doesn't change ♫

319
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,870
That's right.

320
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,260
- You should eat, too.
- Okay.

321
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,190
♫ Dreams will disappear ♫

322
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,560
♫ The dreams without you will all disappear ♫

323
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,080
Ah Rin, be careful.

324
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,170
♫ Still falling ♫

325
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm sad because she seems all grown up already.

326
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,480
I used work as an excuse and didn't do much for her.

327
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,240
She's still a baby. We still have a lot of time.

328
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,250
She needs to go to elementary school, middle school, and high school.

329
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,490
She'll be in puberty then, too.

330
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,480
We need to be prepared for when she hits puberty.

331
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,710
She might suddenly be like, "How do you guys know how I feel?

332
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,990
Don't come into my room!" Stuff like that.

333
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,660
This is so nice.

334
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,990
I feel like we haven't had a conversation like this in a while.

335
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
It's nice.

336
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,900
I...

337
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,120
might've actually wanted...

338
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,360
you not to get your memory back.

339
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,900
Why?

340
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,690
Because I won't ever have this again.

341
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,130
You, me, and our Ah Rin.

342
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,460
The three of us spending time like this.

343
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,330
Honey, what's wrong?

344
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,940
I don't know. I suddenly...

345
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,680
suddenly feel so sad.

346
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,290
I don't know why I'm like this.

347
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,270
I feel strange.

348
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,340
- Honey.
- Yes?

349
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,640
Let's do what you want to do.

350
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,540
If that's best for our family,

351
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,930
I think it's the right thing to do.

352
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,930
I'm okay.

353
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,840
This bastard is bad news.

354
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,870
He was charged with sexual assault a few years ago,

355
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,290
but he removed all the evidence, threatened the victims, and made them withdraw the lawsuits.

356
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,180
He ended up being acquitted.

357
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,860
Who are you, exactly?

358
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,330
You know my father,

359
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,060
but you seem to be involved with Seo Jae Won, too.

360
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,300
Aren't you going to let go?

361
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,120
I said you can't come in without an invitation.

362
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm a police officer, you bastards.

363
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,850
- You can't.
- I said I'm here to see CEO Seo Jae Won.

364
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,070
Move.

365
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,540
Shit.

366
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,890
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,590
So, which room is Seo Jae Won in?

368
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,660
Sun Yeong. Let's say it never happened.

369
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,540
You don't want to lose her, either, right?

370
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,790
So let's cover it up and move on.

371
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,230
This is your method.

372
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,800
You scrape everything and run away if you can't handle it.

373
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,780
[Don't run away. You won't be able to run from the truth.]

374
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,300
Jae Won.

375
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,510
Seo Jae Won.

376
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,660
You're the one who ruined everything.

377
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,160
It's all your fault, I said.

378
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,060
Jae Won. Jae Won?

379
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,490
Jae Won?

380
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
Are you okay?

381
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,510
What? Did you have a nightmare?

382
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
What was it about?

383
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,270
Does your condition have to do with the nightmare, by chance?

384
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,320
It's not like that.

385
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,040
It was just a meaningless dream.

386
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,350
What time is it now?

387
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,390
I need to go to work early for a meeting.

388
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,330
When are you going to the hospital?

389
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,640
- Why?
- I wanted to come with you.

390
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,130
I'm your guardian, you know.

391
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,150
I'm not going to the hospital.

392
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,140
A close friend of mine is a psychologist.

393
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,420
She's been counseling me at the hotel.

394
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,850
Mom! I'm late. I'm late.

395
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,550
Give me my toothbrush.

396
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,290
- Hurry, hurry.
- Okay.

397
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,860
I can't get the compliment sticker if I'm tardy today, too.

398
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,540
Everyone is having a hard time.

399
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,100
You can't be sleeping like this.

400
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,590
Just know you've used up all your vacation time.

401
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,330
How far are we?

402
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,150
We'll arrive in five minutes.

403
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,190
Ms. Seo, do you need to do this interview?

404
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,750
It's not important. It's just to promote the foundation.

405
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,770
I have to.

406
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,220
Sometimes, you have to return the favor.

407
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,650
Welcome, CEO Seo.

408
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,770
We meet again, CEO Seo.

409
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:43,190
In the last interview, you said CEO Seo was the most memorable scholarship student.

410
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,880
Yes. Do you still feel the same way?

411
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,950
Of course.

412
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm happy to see a seed I sowed contributing to society.

413
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,970
But it doesn't matter if they're successful or not.

414
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,270
Everyone is my precious student.

415
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:06,020
Wow, your mindset is different since you do important work.

416
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,960
How about you, CEO Seo?

417
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,080
This is just among us.

418
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,410
Dereve will benefit greatly if Chairman Kwon becomes a minister.

419
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,020
Looks like you're only interested in stuff like that.

420
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,470
Your questions are always the same.

421
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,770
It's more like I'm very interested in you.

422
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,410
By the way, you're okay now, right?

423
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,870
You seemed a bit off when I saw you in front of the store.

424
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,290
You acted like you didn't remember me.

425
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,990
What's he talking about right now?

426
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,970
You're mistaken.

427
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,190
That never happened.

428
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,390
Could you explain what happened at the cafe last time?

429
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,520
Are you not going to answer?

430
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,610
You didn't actually forget, did you?

431
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,970
How could I?

432
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,600
I dropped a glass and cut my hand a bit once.

433
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,850
You must know better since you met the employee and took the CCTV footage.

434
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,760
Well, that's...

435
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,070
I didn't want false rumors to hurt you.

436
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,310
It wasn't even anything serious.

437
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,690
Let's finish the interview now.

438
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,190
What do I do? What do I do? Wait...

439
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,600
Let me get the first aid kit.

440
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,610
Just a moment.

441
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,660
Who should I take this to get an appropriate deal?

442
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,830
Geez...

443
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,680
The rich ones are worse.

444
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,850
This is why I can't quit doing this.

445
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,240
Unbelievable.

446
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,870
Wow.

447
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,990
What are you doing right now?

448
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,090
How dare you come to this place?

449
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,790
It's none of your business.

450
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,320
Do you still have feelings for me, by chance?

451
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,690
- What?
- Just tell me if you're lonely at night.

452
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,160
I can do that much for you.

453
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,620
You're still the same.

454
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,850
You cheapen even the people around you talking like that.

455
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,610
I thought you liked it.

456
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,200
I was too naive then.

457
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,570
You were just a piece of trash.

458
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,940
Don't say anything unnecessary, and just leave quietly.

459
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,720
You'll put the Chairman in a difficult spot this way, not me.

460
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,150
Okay?

461
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,360
Don't you have anything to tell me, Father?

462
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,800
Don't you know how to knock?

463
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,720
Why are you allowing someone like that in the foundation?

464
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,600
Since when? Shouldn't you have told me, at least?

465
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,740
You broke off your engagement a long time ago.

466
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,050
Why are you freaking out about something from the past?

467
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,330
Something from the past?

468
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,380
Is it just something from the past to you?

469
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,520
You're well aware of what that bastard did to me.

470
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,680
That is your problem.

471
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,070
Why are you dragging personal feelings into business?

472
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,770
You can't do anything with such a narrow mind.

473
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,340
What do you mean?

474
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,730
How great of a business are you running, exactly?

475
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,510
Did he promise to turn you into a minister or something?

476
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,590
Who's turning whom into what?

477
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,970
Stop talking nonsense, and get out of here.

478
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,020
Who said you can come in here?

479
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,520
I did.

480
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,430
Or Ms. Seo did.

481
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,160
Come on.

482
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,470
Are you okay in front of all the employees?

483
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,010
Mr. Nam.

484
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,350
- Come on in.
- Okay.

485
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,840
Have you been well, Ms. Seo?

486
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,310
What's this about?

487
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,230
I was curious if things went well last time

488
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,350
and I wanted to ask you if you needed my help, too.

489
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,190
I'm not sure if you remember,

490
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,650
but you asked me to do research on your husband.

491
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,620
I have his call and transaction records here.

492
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,980
I assume you found something very important here.

493
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,990
Aren't you interested?

494
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,070
What's your angle?

495
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,960
Why did you come all the way here to give that to me?

496
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,370
I don't have such a thing.

497
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,190
I just have what you want

498
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,190
and this is kind of worth a lot.

499
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,400
I was just wondering if you're interested in buying it.

500
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,910
I don't need it.

501
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,120
Okay.

502
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,700

By the way...

505
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,740
I don't think anyone around you would tell you the truth right now.

506
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,970
I'm sure there isn't.

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,650
Okay.

546
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,730
Do you remember when we were in school?

547

Excuse me. Student.

550
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,000
What are you doing here right now?

551
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,800
You're not a student.

552

Non-students aren't allowed in here.

553
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,390
The professor said I can.

554
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,060
I suppose he felt sorry for his student who quit her job to start a company.

555
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,700
He said I can use the studio when it's empty.

718
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,920
Please raise her well.

719
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,490
I didn't even know you were ill.

720
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,140
I should've trusted you until the end.

721
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,400
What was I doing on my own?

722
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,670
But I couldn't.

723
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,220
I'm sorry.

724
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,940
Are you sure you won't regret saying that

725
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,350
when you get your memory back?

726
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,600

[105 missed calls. 87 text messages]

- Who's this-
- Ms. Seo Jae Won.

729
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,140
Hold her.

730
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,720
You're under arrest for the murder of Heo Sun Yeong.

731
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,560
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

732
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,860
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

[My Happy Ending]

744
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,070
A highly poisonous pesticide was found in the water bottle Mr. Heo used.

745
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:03,300
And there's a record of Ms. Seo purchasing the pesticide with the same ingredients.

746
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,890
She must be hiding something.

747
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,330
It might have to do with you being framed, too.

748
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,420
Heo Sun Yeong's phone is missing from the list of belongings.

749
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,080
Sun Yeong left this with me.

750
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,790
She's resigning as a CEO.

751
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,280
You need to save the company, though.

752
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,460
Jae Won! Jae Won!

753
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,420
You've always been next to me.

754
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,820
You killed Sun Yeong, didn't you?
