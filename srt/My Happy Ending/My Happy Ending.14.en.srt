Nam Tae Ju told you where Baek Seung Gyu was.

80

So, you went there and talked to him,

81
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,490
but Nam Tae Ju suddenly barged in and killed Mr. Baek.

82
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,420

Coincidentally, something similar happened when you visited Mr. Baek last time.

I think Mr. Baek...

88

- The police?
- Yes.

We'll need an autopsy to find out the cause.

Well, she suffered a lot since she had a bad heart.

It's a complicated situation.

If Nam Tae Ju definitely had a falling out with Kwon Yun Jin

350

and he has evidence for it,

351
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,030
shouldn't we acquire that first?

352
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,200
I don't think we should just wait like this.

353
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Dad's trial comes first.

354
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,610
- Pardon?
- Kwon Yun Jin wants me to get defeated from the trial.

355
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,160
Because it'd be game over if he were found guilty.

356
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,350
She won't act rashly since Nam Tae Ju showed up.

357
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,290
Because she's the one he's after, not me.

358
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,240
Since she understands the situation well,

359
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,690
she'll definitely show up before the trial ends.

I just feel anxious.

379
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,000
The trial is all about whether your father intended murder.

380
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,740
Even if it were true that he didn't rescue her immediately,

381
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,950
he didn't think she'd die immediately

382
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,030
and it won't be considered intentional if it was reasonable.

383
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,020
I'll focus on that and argue that he didn't intend to kill her.

We need objective evidence or testimony to prove that

she threatened him by taking pesticide below the lethal dose three times

388

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,010
What if I testify?

390
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,100
That's definitely an option,

391
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,570

Even though the suspect was required to protect the victim as her husband,

485
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,010
around 16:00 on December 17th, 2016, in the courtyard of his house in Wonjin,

486
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,230
he let the victim die by not rescuing her immediately when she was

487
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:02,380
desperately asking for help after taking a pesticide since he hoped she'd die because

488
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,960
she put them in a financial crisis through frequent gambling.

489
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,120
Therefore, he killed the victim by choosing to let her die.

490
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,060
And he deceived the insurance company by not telling them the victim was poisoned

491
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,420
and received 500 million won as the life insurance payout.

492

The defendant had no intention to kill.

497
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,360
As explained in the statement submitted,

498
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,260
he thought his wife had taken a pesticide

499
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:49,160
below the lethal dose just to threaten him to demand money like she did before.

500
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,650
It's true that he was momentarily angry that she repeatedly hurt her family

501
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,520
and didn't rescue her immediately,

502
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,950
but after a moment, he called 911 himself

503
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,030
and she ended up in the ER.

504
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:10,190
Therefore, the defendant had no intention to kill his wife.

510
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,920
Yes.

511
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,590
The defendant is used to lying since he's been getting prescriptions for someone else.

512
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,850
And even though he knew the victim had been suffering from nephritis,

513
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,620
he didn't rescue her immediately.

514
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:53,050
I think it's not very believable that he had no intention to kill.

515
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,230
Lastly, Defendant,

516
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,390

No. I never heard that.

519
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,950
The fact that he refused an autopsy will be a big disadvantage.

520
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,070

524
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,000
You still haven't been paid back by chance?

525
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,470
No, her husband paid me back.

526
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,350
Was it seven years ago?

527
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,990
I demanded money from him aggressively

528
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,880
and he said he'd be able to pay it back soon.

529
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,310
And out of the blue, he paid me five million won.

530
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,440
It turns out he got the insurance payout after Jeong Mi Hyang died.

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,060
Did you refuse to get an autopsy for the victim, Jeong Mi Hyang?

537
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,500

538
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,110
Why didn't you tell me?

539
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,510
You should've told me.

540
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,040
After you took care of her her whole life?

541
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,020
When your business was finally taking off

542
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,030
and you were finally smiling after being freed from her?

543
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,120
♫ I'm not okay ♫

544
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,020
Okay, got it.

545
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,930
Both people who were in charge are currently abroad.

546
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,020
It'd be hard to reach them since one moved permanently and the other is on sabbatical.

547
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,640
We'll have to find a different solution.

548
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,360
How about you?

549
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,900
Ms. Seo?

550
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,700
Yes. Well...

551
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,750
the one I met today won't be a good witness.

552
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,740
Why not?

553
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,810
She said she would've wanted to kill Mom if she were him.

554
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,720
She said she could easily understand Dad.

555
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,830
Why did Dad refuse to get an autopsy?

556
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,520
If he indeed turned his back on her for me,

557
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,440

00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,070
Is there a way to delay the trial by chance?

570
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,380
We can.

571
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,320
If a witness can't attend the trial,

572
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,910
you can explain the reason and submit a request for delay.

573
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,100
It's just a temporary solution, right?

574
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,160
What if we let the trial happen without delaying it?

575
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,250
Rather than delaying it, submitting evidence or questioning the witness

576
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,870
would still be better for us.

577
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,670
What if we provide various color options other than this?

578
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:26,580
We were thinking of different options, including black with a red edge and white and black.

579
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,990
Where are the samples?

580
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,540
Hold on a second.

581
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,670
What are you doing here?

582
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,890
Did you decide to come back?

583
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,590
Ms. Kwon, I asked Team Leader Yun for help.

584
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,500
I thought it'd be nice to get his feedback.

585
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,620
It's good to get feedback from a professional,

586
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,570
but let's not shift responsibilities, Deputy Choi.

587
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

588
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,410
You can get back to work.

00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,020

591
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,690
after doing something so horrifying?

592
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,090
You think it's me whenever something happens, don't you?

593
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,730
Even though I'm the victim.

594
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,460

00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,570
I'll welcome you.

599
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:53,270
In the end, you ended up this way, my Sun Yeong.

600
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,560
I did contact the chairman.

601
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,840
Do you think it'd work?

602
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,540
It's already working.

603
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,600
Okay.

604
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,570
This is where I leave you.

605
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,870
Here I go. Bam.

606
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,100
What do I do, Father?

607
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,440
What were you thinking when you did this?

608
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:04,060
Sun Yeong threatened me using the recording of our phone conversation about Seung Gyu.

609
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,990
He said he'd hurt you, too.

610
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,350
He said his political career would be over, so...

611
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,000
I had no other choice.

612
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,120
It was recorded well, right?

613
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,600
You must believe me now.

614
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,570
That Kwon Yun Jin planned everything.

615
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,170
You also participated...

616
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,350
in my husband's killing.

617
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,280
Shouldn't you catch Kwon Yun Jin first?

618
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,250
Think carefully.

619
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,200
To catch Kwon Yun Jin and save your father,

620
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,330
you'll need me.

621
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,200
What do you mean?

622
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,800
I used to gamble with your mother.

623
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,580
I lost my entire assets and made my wife die because of Jeong Mi Hyang.

624
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,760
I guess your father didn't tell you.

625
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,550
He does care deeply about his daughter. Seriously.

626
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,500
Call me with this when you decide.

627
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,660
Was it you?

628
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,170
What are you trying to get out of this, exactly?

629
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,950
What were you thinking when you went to see Yun Jin?

630
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,510
It was probably to protect your family.

631
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,390
I'm trying to do the same.

632
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,490
So...

633
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,170
hand me the audio recording on Baek Seung Gyu.

634
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:23,250
I'll forget about everything if you just give me that.

635
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,490
Why are you laughing?

636
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,990
I just wonder...

637
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,720
if I'm different from you at all.

638
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,790
Begging Yun Jin, kneeling in front of her,

639
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,840
wouldn't take back what happened.

640
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,600
It'd be hypocritical to do this now.

641
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,940
You're right.

642
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,970
I did all that since I couldn't trust my wife.

You just need to swallow it.

646
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,320

00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,590

I can't give it to you all the more.

649

You'll never be able to see your family again.

651

No.

665
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:33,200
My mom was willing to do anything to gamble.

666
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,620
She even handed her young daughter to a loan shark to borrow money.

That's all.

668
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,950
Witness, did you know Ms. Jeong's cause of death?

669
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,390
It was multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, as I understand.

670
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,440
Do you mean you didn't know she was poisoned with a pesticide?

671
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,400
I didn't know then. I later found out through an insurance investigator.

674

Your Honor, the witness was hospitalized recently

01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,500
at a mental institute due to severe bipolar disorder.

677
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,320
Also, she wasn't treated properly due to receiving prescriptions through her father for decades

678
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,120
and she has been fined because of that.

679
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,410

01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,440
I'm giving you the last chance.

713
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,180
I gave you options.

714
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,540
Freeze!

715
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,190
You can get out quickly with an extenuating circumstance if you behave.

716
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:26,220
I never would've been by your side if I wanted something from you.

717
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,660
The situation has changed now.

718
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,130
You have so much more to lose now.

719
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,870
Look forward to it.

720
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,090
♫ I walked aimlessly and just like that ♫
