I found this in Kim Mi So's house.

10

They're the letters she and Seo Jae Won exchanged.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,430
The document Kim Sang Beom manipulated couldn't be tracked because it was physically delivered.

He deceived people by running a scholarship foundation.

Do you think it was a coincidence that Kim Sang Beom got into an accident like that now?

151

Maybe it's just karma.

152

Do you think Mr. Heo died for the same reason?

153
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,200
That it wasn't an ordinary crime of passion?

154

It didn't happen in the heat of the moment, right?

- Ask Detective Lee.

198
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,810

I met with one of Kwon Yun Jin's friends she drank with the day Professor Heo died.

210
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,800
She went to a bar with friends after 1 a.m.

211
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,270
- That means-
- Yes.

212
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,740
She has no alibi from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., when Professor Heo presumably died.

213
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,150
I think she changed the time of death on the smartwatch.

214
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,440
And another interesting thing is...

215
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,300
that Kwon Yeong Ik let them take a trip abroad as a group since that day.

216

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,310
Let's change the passcode first.

360
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,170
No, pack your things first.

361
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,420
I think we should go to my place or somewhere else.

362
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm not going.

363
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,100
- I'll stay here.
- This happened for the second time.

364
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
Nam Tae Ju came inside the house. How could you say that?

365
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,460
That's exactly what they want.

366
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,940
They're waiting for me to react and be afraid.

367
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,170
Are you making Ah Rin's favorite fried rice?

368
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,730
It must be nighttime in the US.

369
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,990
Should we do a video chat?

370
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,950
Something serious happened last night.

371
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,240
Don't you want to be comforted?

372
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,660
Will you keep swallowing it like this?

373
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,180
How is it different from the past, then?

374
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,230
Are you okay?

375
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,690
Yes.

376
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,070
Yes, I'm okay.

377
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,990
It's really tasty.

378
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,740
I'm glad I didn't make it.

379
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,770
Let's eat quickly and leave.

380
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,990
We're busy today.

381
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,330
Thank you for your courage to do this.

382
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,630
I'm sure it'd be very helpful.

383
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,230
I'm not sure.

384
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,050
This probably won't be enough.

385
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,940
Even if we prove the Minister's crime,

386
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,100
he'll likely pay a fine or be put on probation.

387
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,000
It's okay. The parliamentary inspection is coming up soon.

388
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,670
Being investigated itself would affect him enough.

389
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,320
Please thank Jae Won for me.

390
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,730
He was able to get surgery, thanks to her.

391
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,200
Okay.

392
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,730
What do you plan to do now?

393
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,100
It'd be suspicious if I quit right away.

394
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,110
I'll quit when the time comes.

395
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,370
Okay, then.

396
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:42,370
Call me anytime if something comes up.

397
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,120
Okay.

398
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,770
A valuable guest brought a precious present.

399
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm flattered.

400
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:03,290
I wasn't sure what to bring since this is my first time visiting you.

401
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,210
I was thinking of gifting you something expensive,

402
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,610
but I thought you might find it troublesome.

403
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:13,570
It feels like you, whom I have never met before, seem to

404
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,800
read my mind better than the ones I've known for decades.

405
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,510
I thought it would suit you perfectly.

406
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,840
It's very pretty.

407
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:32,950
It's fun to look at the curves of the leaves of this orchid.

408
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,510
You certainly are knowledgeable.

409
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,650
Orchids are often compared to a hermit who lives

410
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,780
gracefully far away from the secular world.

411
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,800
Do you think it'd be possible?

412
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,660
It doesn't matter to me since I'm an old man who likes to sit here

413
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,130
and enjoy the scenery.

414
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,330
You don't have to get splashed with muddy water.

415
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,570
I should get going now.

416
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,040
See you tomorrow, Seung Gyu.

417
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,090
We set aside one big obstacle.

418
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,180
He could change his mind anytime.

419
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,130
We need to be careful.

420
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,910
Hey, Seong Hui.

421
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,720
Seung Gyu woke up, Ms. Seo.

422
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,930
Yes.

423
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,520
Okay, got it.

424
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,480
Seung Gyu woke up.

425
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,260
- Let's go.
- Okay.

426
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,790
Please check the vital signs.

427
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,240
Thankfully, there are no serious problems.

428
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,480
But they still need to keep an eye on him.

429
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,060
Seong Hui, let's step out for a second.

430
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,450
I'm sorry.

431
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,780
You must've gone through a lot.

432
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,870
I was so angry...

433
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,330
and I couldn't believe it at first.

434
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,680
I was thinking of leaving him whether he died or not.

435
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:57,330
But I thought I should listen to his side of the story

436
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,210
and wait until he wakes up, at least.

437
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,000
What are you going to do?

438
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,000
- CEO Kwon.
- I'm thinking right now.

439
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,010
Thinking won't fix this issue.

440
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,610
There's no need for us to make a move now.

441
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,210
We still have time.

442
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,640

443

You're so sure.

444
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,510
Jae Won would be like that.

445
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,960
What kind of deal...

446
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,310
did Jae Won suggest?

447
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,770
Deal?

448
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,420
Did you think I wouldn't know, by chance?

449
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,670
There's no way she just let you go.

450
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,610
She said she'd pay me more than you.

451
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:21,680
She said, "There's no way you didn't save evidence while cleaning up."

452
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,820
It sounds like...

453
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,830
you have evidence.

454
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,480

Yein Scholarship Foundation, an art scholarship foundation, is being

462
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,810
accused of accepting hundreds of millions won in bribes,

463
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,790
embezzling donation money, and corrupt recruitment.

Yes, Minister.

I need to schedule a meeting with Assemblyman Park immediately.

468

I have a lot to discuss with him.

469
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:05,310
Well, you won't be able to see him since his schedule is full right now.

470

00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,310
To find out what they're thinking-

538
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,180
How long do you think you could ignore me?

539
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,180
I won't disappear, Jae Won.

540
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,490
You can't go in there!

541
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,590
Please leave.

542
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,480
I'll call you back.

543
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,950
You must be busy. Sorry for visiting you again.

544
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,960
You became pretty reckless.

545
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,550
Don't you know where you are?

546
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,190
I know where I am.

547
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,100
I'm at Minister Kwon Yeong Ik's last stop in his political career.

548
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,200
You think you could hurt me with some tabloid rumor?

549
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,840
How about...

550
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,980
this, then?

551
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,470
Seung Gyu...

552
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,250
Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

553
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,880
It couldn't be helped because he threatened to kill us both.

554
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,860
Is he dead?

555
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,880
What do I do now, Father?

556
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,100
Come home immediately.

557
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:50,370
Is this the audio file you've been so desperately looking for?

558
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:55,090
It doesn't say Yun Jin pushed him at all.

559
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,210
You're right.

560
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,680
She said he fell, not pushed.

561
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,610
But if this file gets released,

562
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:07,130
it won't matter if Baek Seung Gyu was pushed or not.

563
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,910
What matters is you knew about this but tried to cover it up.

564
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,420
On top of that...

565
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,110
Seung Gyu's awake.

566
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,600
Do you think...

567
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,430
I'd just let you be?

568
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,530
Don't let me be.

569
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,030

- You'll have to decide before you come.

I'm here.

Are you feeling okay?

576
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,250
Don't overdo it.

579
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,260
She'll be here soon.

580
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,400
- Have you eaten?
- I ate.

581
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,240
You made it.

You've been through a lot.

584
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,810
I-I'm so sorry, CEO Seo.

585
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,720
I'm sorry.

586
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,660
Isn't what we're planning too dangerous?

587
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,640
We can't drag them outside if we don't do that.

588
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,280
Because what they ultimately want is me.

589
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,810
What if something bad happens to you?

590
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,310
Why would that happen?

I've been thinking about that bastard.

Was he perhaps a Yein Foundation scholarship student?
