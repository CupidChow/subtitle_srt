 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents, and situations in this drama are fictitious. Safety regulations were followed while filming with child actors.

9
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:14,960

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,200
Excuse me. Did you find anything?

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,970
No, it's clean.

12
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,830
Couldn't even find a partial fingerprint.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,440
- Sunbaenim.
 - Yes.

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,360
There's only one CCTV near the entrance, but it's broken.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,150
But it was captured by CCTV on a big street a short distance from here.

16
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,000
The time it was captured was 9:07 pm.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,410
- Anyone else in the car?
 - We can't confirm that.

18
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,230
Shit.

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,910
- Is he the one who called in? 
 - Yes, he's the manager of the property.

20
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,100
He found him when he stopped by in the morning.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,520
Start questioning him. Look for more CCTVs nearby, too.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,410
Got it, sir.

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,520
I heard he was Seo Jae Won's husband.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
Well, yes. What's the cause of death?

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,210
I think it was poison.

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,470
There's a sign he vomited.

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,700
But I think he was forced to take it since his wrist has a strap mark.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,290
You mean it was foul play.

29
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,230
Yes. Aigoo. He must've been in pain the moment he died.

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,810
It appears he died at 1:42 a.m.

31
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,710
He had a smartwatch.

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,730
What a great world.

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,720
It checks your pulse 24-7.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,060
It tells you when your heart stops, too.

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,870
I'm sure that's not why he bought it.

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,630
Hey, check in the back, too.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,900
 Secretary Kim

38
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,630
 105 missed calls. 87 text messages

39
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,680
- Who's this—
 - Ms. Seo Jae Won.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,130
Hold her.

41
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,530
You're under arrest without a warrant for the murder of Heo Sun Yeong.

42
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,510
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

43
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,490
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

 My Happy Ending

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,940
Where were you, and what were you doing 
  Episode 10

46
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,790
on the morning of the 26th between 1 and 3 a.m.? 
  Episode 10

47
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,330
You went to the hotel room after 4 a.m.

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,280
You purchased pesticides recently, right?

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,960
We found pesticide in the water bottle in the vehicle.

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,140
Mr. Heo Sun Yeong was poisoned.

52
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,940
It was banned from sale because it's highly poisonous and has no color or odor.

53
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,170
You purchased it through your father's acquaintance, who runs a pesticide company, right?

54
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,180
We already got his testimony, too.

55
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,310
He said you bought it in person.

56
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,570
Why did you buy pesticides?

57
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,390
Why does a CEO of a company need it?

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,840
And it looks like your mother was sent to

59
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,880
the ER after taking pesticide. Is that correct?

60
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,430
Ms. Seo Jae Won.

61
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,210
Ms. Seo, will you keep refusing to answer? Huh?

62
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,620
What?

63
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,160
Ms. Seo's attorney is here.

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,700
Geez...

65
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,350
I'm Ms. Seo's attorney.

66
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,080
How did it go?

67
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,410
It's not looking good.

68
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,980
A highly toxic pesticide was found in the water bottle Mr. Heo used.

69
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,150
And there's a record of Ms. Seo purchasing pesticide with the same ingredients.

70
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,670
She won't say why she purchased it or what she used it for.

71
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,500
So, there's no way to know.

72
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,350
The bigger issue is that it'll be difficult

73
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,840
to prove her alibi when the incident happened.

74
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,080
I understand.

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,570
I'll look into it, too. Please look for a solution.

76
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,290
We can't leave her in there for long.

77
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,580
There will be an article on CEO Seo tomorrow.

78
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,670
Article?

79
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,040
It's regarding her mental illness, apparently.

80
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,890
Looks like they'll tie it to the murder case and drop a bombshell.

81
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,120
Which news company is it?

82
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,600
There's a reporter named Choi Do Hun who's been chasing after CEO Seo.

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,230
You couldn't even stop a reporter? What have you been doing?

84
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,610
You should've told us about that sooner.

85
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,710
What will you do now?

86
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,220
That's enough.

87
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,850
Are you all confident?

88
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,860
Can you handle Derêve without Seo Jae Won?

89
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,500
To convince the investors on CEO Seo's side,

90
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,180
we'll have to access the ledger or request a copy of it.

91
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,920
You think they'll be willing to give it to us?

92
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,920
We'll have to request an injunction if they refuse.

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,180
The sales have recently dropped significantly,

94
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,710
and the brand image has been damaged, too.

95
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,800
The court will accept it if we prove that

96
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,640
her ability to run a business should be questioned.

97
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,120
I'll get ready for a shareholders' meeting as soon as possible...

98
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,180
because CEO Seo didn't create Deréve on her own.

99
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,700
They want to fire the CEO?

100
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,900
I heard they'll have a shareholders' meeting soon, replace the directors who support CEO Seo,

101
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,780
and request to modify the bylaws.

102
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,680
Where's Director Park right now?

103
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,490
How's Ms. Seo doing?

104
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,480
Director Park.

105
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,610
What are you doing right now?

106
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,510
What the hell have you been doing?

107
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,170
We need to save the company first.

108
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,030
Are you saying the company will crumble because of CEO Seo?

109
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,010
Everyone's talking about that on the news and the internet.

110
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,650
"Derêve's CEO, Seo Jae Won, was arrested without a warrant as a suspect in a murder."

111
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,420
How long do you think we could last at this rate?

112
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,250
The powerless employees are

113
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,880
the first to suffer damage when the sales go down.

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,930
- I don't think CEO Seo wants that, either.
 - I see.

115
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,560
That's why you went to see the chairman first

116
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,620
and foremost to remove her, right?

117
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,720
Team Leader Yun!

118
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,470
She'll be acquitted soon.

119
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,570
Don't act rashly.

120
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,150
The interrogation will continue tomorrow morning.

121
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,070
Let me know if you need anything before you're sent to the holding cell.

122
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,580
Is he really dead?

123
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,010
Pardon?

124
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,940
Is my husband...

125
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,820
really dead?

126
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,110
Oppa.

127
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,300
Will you keep refusing to eat?

128
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,270
I know you're upset, but you need to eat at times like this.

129
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,240
Later. I'll eat later.

130
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,800
Watch Ah Rin for a bit, then.

131
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I'll stop by next door real quick.

132
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,110
Okay.

133
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,790
 Her husband even tried to leak her company's design.

134
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,010
 I think that's enough for the murder motive.

135
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,350
 If she planned the murder using pesticide...

136
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,750
 Seo Jae Won, who was arrested for the murder of her husband while awaiting a divorce lawsuit,

137
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,170
 has just been questioned by the police.

138
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,630
 The police are remaining silent about releasing the arrest warrant.

139
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,410
 Seo Jae Won has yet to

140
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,280
 make a statement regarding the case.

141
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,290
- Grandpa.
 - Hey.

142
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,340
Why did you get up?

143
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,550
Just because.

144
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't sleep?

145
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,600
When's Dad coming back?

146
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,700
Well...

147
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,470
How about Mom, then?

148
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,720
Grandpa, I want to go home.

149
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,910
I miss Mom and Dad.

150
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Come here.

151
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,650
Aigoo...

152
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Mom will...

153
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,690
come after you get some sleep.

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,420
She'll come for sure.

155
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,970
How are things going?

156
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,000
We'll determine the warrant's validity when the additional questioning ends tomorrow.

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Do you know about Professor Heo and Kwon Yun Jin's relationship?

158
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,210
Of course, I do.

159
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,580
We already confirmed her alibi, too.

160
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,360
She was at a bar when Mr. Heo was suspected to have died.

161
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,510
We got testimony from her friends, too.

162
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,860
Even if she hadn't been at the scene, she could've put pesticide in the water bottle earlier.

163
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,500
You said the inside of the car was cleaned after Mr. Heo died.

164
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
How will you explain not a single fingerprint in the car?

165
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,990
There might've been an accomplice or...

166
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,240
Where was Nam Tae Ju that day?

167
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,370
Wow. You're really taking this too far. Do you have evidence?

168
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,100
And Detective Nam was with me that day.

169
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Anyway, I'm done talking. You're on your own now.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Also, don't call me for stuff like this from now on.

171
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,200
Geez...

172
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,800
Geez, how did you know I was here?

173
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,550
Why do you keep reporting to him about every little thing?

174
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,780
This is all your fault.

175
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,570
I got involved with him because of Baek Seung Gyu.

176
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,600
Shit, you think that's all my fault?

177
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,660
No, it's not that...

178
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm just saying I'm put on the spot.

179
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
Did you find anything else?

180
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,800
Well, we didn't find anything definitive.

181
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
I told Yun Te Oh that you have an alibi like you asked me to.

182
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
Good work.

183
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,600
By the way, how involved are you in this?

184
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,210
The factory property where this case happened is

185
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,400
where your cold case happened.

186
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,700
By chance...

187
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,900
It can't be, right?

188
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
You think I killed him?

189
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,300
I mean...

190
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,810
Do you think Seo Jae Won killed her husband?

191
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,900
Just look at how the situation is going.

192
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,800
Anyone would say Seo Jae Won is the culprit.

193
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Sunbaenim, what do you think about it?

194
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,220
I don't know. We'll find out eventually.

195
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,550
By the way, Heo Sun Yeong's phone is missing from the list of belongings.

196
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,000
Was it never there?

197
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,260
She would've gotten rid of it if it were a premeditated murder.

198
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,370
You think Seo Jae Won did that?

199
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,900
- All done?
 - Yes, it's done.

200
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,760
Carry on, then.

201
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,540
I heard there has been a commotion.

202
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,100
Would the minister hearing go okay?

203
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,470
Mr. Kim is very worried about it.

204
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,010
It won't be an issue.

205
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,300
I will not let you lose face for recommending me.

206
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Of course.

207
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,950
You have to watch out for even a falling leaf right now.

208
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,710
By the way,

209
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,120
why are you trying to shake the tree yourself?

210
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
What do you mean by that?

211
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm talking about CEO Seo Jae Won.

212
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,100
What's the reason you took care of her yourself?

213
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I learned about it from the news, too.

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Chairman Kwon,

215
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,000
you're ready to become a politician now.

216
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,200
You have a good poker face, unlike your father.

217
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,900
If you've decided to abandon the sword you've been using,

218
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,740
make sure to break it properly.

219
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,670
A rusty sword hurts the most.

220
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,400
Police Chief.

221
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,740
I suppose you came to say hello to him, too.

222
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,710
Yes. Looks like you beat me to it.

223
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,680
Let's have a gathering soon.

224
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,650
Sounds good.

225
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,020
I don't like you questioning like this without clear evidence.

226
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,240
So, I'm asking where she was at the time.

227
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,940
How many times did I tell you?

228
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,040
She fell asleep in the car since she didn't feel well that day.

229
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,940
And she went to the hotel when she woke up at night.

230
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,100
What are the odds? You mean she fell asleep with the car off,

231
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,000
so the dash cam doesn't work. And it had to be when Mr. Heo died.

232
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,580
Let's be honest. How do we know if she actually

233
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,210
fell asleep or parked the car somewhere and killed someone?

234
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,800
You even prepared for a divorce lawsuit with him recently.

235
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
Why would you ask us that?

236
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,000
And the divorce is separate from this case. Don't speculate.

237
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
The sale of pesticides was banned,

238
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,880
but you can easily get them from the manufacturer.

239
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,700
- You know, right? 
 - That's why I'm asking her to say something.

240
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,800
Why did you buy the pesticide?

241
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,360
What did you use it for?

242
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,300
Why did I not know?

243
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,900
I could've known easily. Easily...

244
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,350
H-How come I didn't notice it?

245
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,320
Since when...

246
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,800
Since when, since when, since when?

247
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
How did it go?

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,710
It's frustrating because Ms. Seo won't say why she bought the pesticide.

249
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,260
She needs to talk so I can do something. I don't know why she's remaining silent.

250
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,240
I don't know why she's remaining silent.

251
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,200
Did they find additional evidence?

252
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Not yet. I think the detective is forcing it

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,270
since they don't have conclusive evidence.

254
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,840
We can look forward to her being released soon for lack of evidence.

255
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,780
How's she right now? She's okay, right?

256
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm not sure how to describe this.

257
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,420
Ms. Seo Jae Won...

258
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,570
- is kind of strange right now. 
 - Did she have medicine in her possession?

259
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,000
Medicine?

260
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,800
What medicine?

261
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,520
Never mind.

262
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,000
Gosh, why do you think she's doing that?

263
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm not sure.

264
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,670
I heard she requested a visitor. Did you hear?

265
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,230
What?

266
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,130
Jae Won,

267
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,340
are you okay?

268
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,300
It was that day seven years ago.

269
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,480
I definitely saw it at the event venue, too. Why didn't I think of that?

270
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,620
It was definitely there when I received a basket of flowers. Yes.

271
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,330
Seo Jae Won...

272
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,300
I'll leave now.

273
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,540
It's you, isn't it?

274
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,970
Ami.

275
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,430
Why didn't I know?

276
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,470
You've always...

277
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,400
been by my side.

278
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,190
You desired what I had.

279
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,080
In order to take what I had,

280
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,870
you've been circling around my family and me.

281
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,490
From seven years ago and until now.

282
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,870
What are you talking about?

283
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,840
Ami?

284
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,850
What's that, anyway?

285
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,750
You're the one...

286
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,150
who killed Sun Yeong, right?

287
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,030
Jae Won,

288
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,970
I know you're very sick,

289
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,290
but be careful what you say.

290
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,720
Who killed whom, exactly?

291
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,370
No, no, no...

292
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,780
I got all of my memories back.

293
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,980
Then, you also must know now.

294
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,620
Sun Yeong and I used to love each other—

295
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,190
 POLICE

296
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,760
You're always by Seo Jae Won's side without fail.

297
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,070
I can say the same about you.

298
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,910
You even used Baek Seung Gyu.

299
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,990
People are so imaginative.

300
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,240
Do they actually say I did that? Why would I?

301
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,980
You're making me even more curious.

302
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,530
What makes you so shameless like this?

303
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,720
Don't you know there's no going back anymore?

304
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,690
I was never interested in going back, to begin with.

305
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,050
Go inside.

306
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,090
Jae Won seems to be struggling a lot.

307
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,290
Make sure to comfort her a lot.

308
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,930
You're being released because of a lack of evidence.

309
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't think you're acquitted yet.

310
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,350
Make sure to come when we call you for additional questioning.

311
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,720
Let's go.

312
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,700
 The people together with trusted police

313
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,360
 Upright and fair police

314
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,060
Here she comes!

315
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,790
- It's Seo Jae Won!
 - Seo Jae Won's here.

316
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,020
Here she comes! Here she comes!

317
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,750
Excuse me.

318
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,190
Ms. Seo, do you admit to murdering your husband?

319
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,780
Why did you purchase the pesticide?

320
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,260
How do you feel right now?

321
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,950
I'll send out a press release. Please make way.

322
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,990
Your daughter lost her dad.

323
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,840
Don't you feel bad for her?

324
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,240
Do you have any sense of guilt?

325
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,510
How do you feel?

326
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,910
CEO Seo!

327
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
Where should we take you?

328
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,890
There are reporters at the office and at your house.

329
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,000
Same with the hotel.

330
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,690
Let's go to my place. That would be better.

331
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,720
How did I get out?

332
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,130
Because you didn't commit any crime.

333
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,550
I'll get going now, then.

334
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,200
Thank you, Secretary Kim.

335
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,120
I just did my job. Don't mention it.

336
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,330
Take good care of yourself, CEO.

337
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,290
Thanks a lot, Seong Hui.

338
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,760
I can stay at the studio. Don't worry about me.

339
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,240
I told my sister in advance, too.

340
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,870
What? Do you not want to?

341
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,440
I miss Ah Rin.

342
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,940
♫  Does it matter after all?  ♫

343
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,850
 My...

344
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,760
 entire world was destroyed because of you.

345
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,760
 I hated you so much that I wanted to kill you.

346
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,460
 Did you know?

347
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,820
 I might've actually wanted

348
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,090
 you not to get your memory back.

349
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,150
 Because I thought I won't ever have this again.

350
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,060
 You, me, and our Ah Rin.

351
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,930
 The three of us spending time like this.

352
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,580
 I should've trusted you until the end. But I couldn't.

353
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,680
 I'm sorry.

354
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,020
 I'm sorry.

355
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,110
Pull over for a second.

356
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,610
♫  and the bland greeting in the whispered words  ♫

357
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,770
♫  It falls to pieces when you come around  ♫

358
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,850
I killed him.

359
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,780
I killed him.

360
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,380
No.

361
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,600
No...

362
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,900
Sun Yeong, no...

363
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,880
♫  In the night when everything goes dark  ♫

364
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,390
I killed you.

365
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:06,930
♫  I try and try to find my peace of mind  ♫

366
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:13,800
♫  In my broken heart I'm walking  ♫

367
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:21,320
♫  Can you make all of the scars just disappear?  ♫

368
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,180
♫  But when I close my eyes  ♫

369
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,730
Get some sleep if you're tired. I'll wake you up when we arrive.

370
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,520
It's okay.

371
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,600
Do you need anything?

372
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,800
No.

373
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Are you hungry, then?

374
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,800
♫  and the bland greeting in the whispered words  ♫

375
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,140
Do you have water?

376
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,220
Yes. Just one second.

377
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,860
Here.

378
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:03,840
♫  fall to pieces whenever you come around  ♫

379
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,960
I was scared

380
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,670
they might find out about my illness

381
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,050
since I haven't taken my medicine in a while.

382
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,240
Can they not?

383
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,260
Why do you have to hide it?

384
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,710
It's not your fault.

385
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:30,120
Because I thought that was the way to protect myself.

386
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,810
You can leave now.

387
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,250
Thank you.

388
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,960
And I'm sorry again.

389
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,010
Don't think about anything and just rest today.

390
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,300
Don't watch TV.

391
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,950
Don't listen to others or have negative thoughts.

392
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,080
And don't be sick, either.

393
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,190
That's a lot.

394
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm just saying.

395
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,270
I'm right here.

396
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,700
In front of you.

397
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,910
Drive safely.

398
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,860
Dad.

399
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,460
Jae—

400
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,290
J-Jae Won.

401
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,810
Aigoo, Jae Won.

402
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,620
Jae Won.

403
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,060
Wasn't it difficult to get here?

404
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,440
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

405
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000
No, no. What are you talking about?

406
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,700
Let's go inside for now. Come on.

407
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,870
 Seo Yun Jin

408
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,880
 Here.  
  Seo Yun Jin

409
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,340
Make sure to keep it for generations.

410
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,060

411
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,460
I made sure Baek Seung Gyu couldn't wake up for a while.

412
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,220
But it's unclear if we can continue

413
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,000
since the hospital strengthened security.

414
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,890
Continue to keep an eye on him.

415
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,130
Yes.

416
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,300
You don't exist in this world.

417
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,490
- You know, right?
 - Yes.

418
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,170
I can't stop looking at this.

419
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,040
It has mythological qualities to it.

420
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,710
Don't be pretentious and

421
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,760
get to the point.

422
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,420
Straight to the point. I like that.

423
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,290
I like things that are straightforward, too.

424
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,390
Simple and clear.

425
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,800
But I can't stand it when people cut in without using a turn signal.

426
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,350
Just so you know.

427
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm glad to hear that.

428
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,530
At least, we have one thing in common.

429
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,400
Okay. What should we do now?

430
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,060
Yun Te Oh is giving me a headache by poking around here and there.

431
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,570
I don't think I'll just let him do that anymore.

432
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,710
Just take care of Seo Jae Won. Just Seo Jae Won.

433
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,200
Don't touch Yun Te Oh.

434
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Are you going to switch to him?

435
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,280
You'd better not...

436
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,220
cross the line, either.

437
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,490
Okay. I'll just do as I'm told.

438
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,000
If so, here I go!

439
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Where did she go?

440
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,690
Jae Won.

441
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,890
Jae Won.

442
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,130
Jae Won!

443
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,790
Jae Won!

444
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,440
- What brings you here?
 - Is there something wrong?

445
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,150
- Where's Ms. Seo?
 - She came last night,

446
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,890
but she disappeared this morning.

447
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,510
Stay at home. I'll look for her.

448
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,440
I'll look, too.

449
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,470
Jae Won.

450
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,490
How did it go?

451
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,590
 I logged in with her ID just in case,

452
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,180
and there was a card payment record. So I checked.

453
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,710
She just bought a bus ticket to Samcheok.

454
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,530
Okay. Got it.

455
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,470
 Yun Jin.

456
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,200
 Mom!

457
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,640
 You waited for long, didn't you?

458
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,340
 No.

459
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,800
 Why are you smiling?

460
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,940
 It's nothing. I'm just happy that you're smiling.

461
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,030
 Here.

462
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,380
 Get me a carton of milk at the store over there.

463
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,650
 What kind of milk?

464
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,870
 Strawberry milk. Your favorite.

465
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,550
 Okay.

466
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,350
 I'll be right back.

467
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,120
 Here. Go ahead and drink it.

468
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,080
 Go ahead.

469
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,000
 Mirim Milk

470
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,800
 Aren't you thirsty?

471
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,180
 Hurry up and drink it.

472
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,920
 It's your favorite.

473
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
 Here.

474
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,700
 It's my...

475
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,180
 only wish.

476
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,100
 Drink it.

477
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,830
 Mirim Milk

478
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,430
 I'm sorry.

479
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,000
 But...

480
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,770
 I couldn't help it.

481
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,550
 Don't worry.

482
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:43,430
 It will be nothing once you get some sleep.

483
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,780
 Mom.

484
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,160
 I'm so sleepy.

485
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,500
 There's a term called "tunnel vision."

486
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 A driver who's driving inside a dark tunnel

487
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,650
 can't see anything but the light

488
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,500
 coming out of the exit he's heading toward.

489
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,800
The people who commit suicide often have tunnel vision.

490
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,660
They can't see their surroundings clearly

491
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,000
because they're obsessed with the issue they're facing.

492
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,400
They end up thinking there's only one way to be free from pain.

493
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,550
 Ending everything themselves.

494
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,530
 They end up believing that's the only way

495
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:21,280
 to the exit by following the light.

496
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,030
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

497
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,020
♫  t's scattered through the empty darkness  ♫

498
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:33,170
♫  I wanna know.  ♫

499
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,860
♫  You blow in.  ♫

500
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:43,120
♫  I wanna know  ♫

501
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,070
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch.  ♫

502
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,420
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

503
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,380
 Mom.

504
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,090
 I'm cold.

505
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,920
 Hang in there for a moment.

506
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,940
 We'll soon...

507
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,260
 have a happy ending.

508
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,720
♫  On the truth which is harsh, the aborted ending  ♫

509
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,430
♫  Us at the time. Will you also look back sometimes?  ♫

510
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,740
♫  I wanna know.  ♫

511
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,290
♫  You blow in.  ♫

512
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,220
 Mom.

513
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,690
 Is this really the happy ending?

514
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,550
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch.  ♫

515
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,450
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

516
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,400
♫  I'm not okay. I can't hear your voice.  ♫

517
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,940
♫  I picture us who are only in my dream  ♫

518
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,520
♫  I'm left alone in the dark  ♫

519
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,340
♫  I'm wandering searching the dream for the light which is you  ♫

520
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,300
♫  I'm left alone in the dark  ♫

521
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,700
♫  I'm searching for the light which is you  ♫

522
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,370
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch.  ♫

523
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:16,150
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

524
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,050
♫  I'm not okay. I can't hear your voice.  ♫

525
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:26,600
♫  I draw us who are only in my dream  ♫

526
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,150
 Mom.

527
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,600
 I won't forget

528
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,540
 that day and this ocean.

529
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,000
 I won't run away.

530
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,150
Seo Jae Won!

531
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,020
Seo Jae Won!

532
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,000
What are you doing here?

533
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,300
Get out.

534
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,000
- Let's talk for a second.
 - I have nothing to say.

535
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,000
Don't disappear without a word again.

536
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,360
If you do, I won't hold back then.

537
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,600
I swear it's not like that.

538
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,300
- I wasn't trying to die. 
 - You should've answered my call, then.

539
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,200
Do you know how scared I was?

540
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,300
Don't do stuff like that.

541
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,390
I won't ask anything from you.

542
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,800
I won't even ask you to look at me. So...

543
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,740
So, please...

544
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,980
just don't disappear from my sight.

545
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,800
Let me ask you a favor, then.

546
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,850
Please take care of my Ah Rin.

547
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,730
What do you mean?

548
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,520
You're being serious again.

549
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,030
I can't always be next to her.

550
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,810
I don't know how the situation will change, either.

551
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,880
Please?

552
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,410
Are you in a bad mood today, Ah Rin?

553
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,790
Did something happen?

554
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,760
No.

555
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,900
Just tell me.

556
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,000
What happened?

557
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,100
- The thing is...
 - Yeah.

558
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,490
My teacher said your wish would come true

559
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,750
if you prayed to the supermoon.

560
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:08,740
So, I prayed as hard as I could without even sleeping.

561
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,800
But it didn't come true.

562
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,540
I see. So, you were upset.

563
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,430
What did you pray for, Ah Rin?

564
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,190
Tell me.

565
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,570
I'll make sure it comes true.

566
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,300
I prayed to be together with you and Dad again.

567
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,500
Ah Rin, that's—

568
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,900
Mom, is Dad not coming back?

569
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,100
No.

570
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,250
It's not like that.

571
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,670
Can you please...

572
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,430
give me just a little more time?

573
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I'll explain everything to you later.

574
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,920
Thank you.

575
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,910
Let's go. Thank you.

576
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,600
Let's go.

577
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,760
I said I'm fine.

578
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,620
 You're sure you're okay, right?

579
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,190
 Call me immediately if something happens.

580
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,910
Okay.

581
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,560
Long time no see, Nam Cheol.

582
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,930
I was surprised to hear from you out of the blue.

583
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,490
I know.

584
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,480
I didn't think I'd be calling you directly.

585
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,930
I wasn't so sure, actually.

586
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,790
Considering what happened to

587
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,660
Sun Yeong and what the articles said,

588
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,920
I wasn't sure if I should be calling you or not.

589
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,420
What did you want to see me for?

590
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,160
Sun Yeong left this with me.

591
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,030
He asked me to hold on to it just in case.

592
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,350
Sun Yeong did?

593
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,710
I didn't check to see what's in it.

594
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,950
I thought that was the right thing to do.

595
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,380
Thank you.

596
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,580
I'll have a look at it.

597
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,770
But you know...

598
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:43,200
I'm not sure if I can tell you this, but

599
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,730
Sun Yeong was looking for

600
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,760
his daughter's biological father before he died.

601
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,350
 USB Drive {D}

602
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,100
 Audio file

603
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,400
 Father.

604
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,370
 I need you to help me.

605
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,760
 S-Seung Gyu...

606
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,520
 Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

607
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,460
 It couldn't be helped because he threatened to kill us both.

608
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,310
 Is he dead?

609
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,770
 I don't know.

610
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,170
 Come home immediately.

611
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,740
Is it true the Busan store is closing?

612
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,830
You know that's the first Derêve store.

613
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,850
CEO Seo put the most effort into that one.

614
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,700
So what?

615
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,250
The sales dropped the most there.

616
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,180
We might need to reduce the workforce if this doesn't work.

617
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,510
CEO Seo is definitely coming back.

618
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,890
She wasn't acquitted yet

619
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,870
and everyone's still criticizing her.

620
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,660
How would she justify coming back?

621
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,000
 Is Seo Jae Won mentally ill? She's engaged in self-harm since her school days.

622
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,070
Tell her if you get to meet her.

623
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:19,270
It might look better if she resigns by herself.

624
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,520
We have to save the company, at least.

625
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,110
What are the directors's reactions?

626
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:36,650
They're feeling uneasy.

627
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,300
To be honest, it's not good.

628
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,120
The headlines have been so negative.

629
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,880
But they were already disproved.

630
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,450
I know, but...

631
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,880
the issue is that it led to Derêve's decline in sales.

632
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,480
You know how the shareholders are.

633
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,520
They don't care who the CEO is as long as they make them money.

634
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,400
If that were the case, it wouldn't be a problem at all.

635
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,520
Would it be possible?

636
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,850
CEO Seo might not be able to right now.

637
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,580
We should give it a try.

638
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,090
Chairman Kwon Yeong Ik is using Director Park

639
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,570
to get the shareholders to vote for your dismissal.

640
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,570
You need to decline the summons and try to come up with a solution—

641
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,250
Te Oh.

642
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,830
Yes.

643
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,800
Would declining mean anything?

644
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,650
You said there are articles about my illness, right?

645
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,370
They said they stopped Reporter Choi from publishing it.

646
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,550
What if they're right?

647
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,400
It's true that I'm causing harm to Derêve.

648
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:56,330
It's also true that I'm suffering from a mental illness.

649
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,420
The articles can come out anytime.

650
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,600
No, that won't happen.

651
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,990
I'll prevent it from now on.

652
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,510
Yes, Attorney.

653
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,670
 Ms. Seo, the first autopsy report came out.

654
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,820
I heard Heo Sun Yeong's autopsy report came out.

655
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,320
Yes.

656
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,500
Here you go.

657
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,340
Shit.

658
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,850
Didn't the smartwatch say 1:42?
  Autopsy Report

659
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,100
Yes.

660
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,300
Wh-When did you get here?

661
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,270
The autopsy report says 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.

662
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,700
How interesting, right?

663
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,770
This is your share of Derêve's stock.

664
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,120
Attend the shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

665
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,850
You just need to do as I say.

666
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,000
Why don't you just do it on your own

667
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,360
instead of telling me, then?

668
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,300
Because you need to attend, at least.

669
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,880
Shouldn't you prove your worth now?

670
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,720
You abandoned your precious Seo Jae Won, too.

671
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,840
What would be the point in me proving it?

672
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,900
You've had everything just because you're my daughter.

673
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,880
Remember that everything

674
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,200
you have comes from me.

675
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,110
Derêve 
 &lt;--

676
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,920
 Derêve's First 2023 Shareholders' Meeting

677
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,860
 Kwon Yeong Ik

678
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,330
 Seo Jae Won

679
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,270
What are you doing here?

680
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:10,910
Didn't you know I'm Derêve's shareholder?

681
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:15,130
I'm a shareholder of this company, thanks to my capable father.

682
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,140
How does it feel?

683
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,470
You killed the man you loved, framed your friend,

684
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,170
and you have her company now.

685
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,000
Yeah.

686
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,360
I feel great

687
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,150
because I'll be seeing Seo Jae Won getting kicked out of Derêve.

688
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,930
Now, it turns out you're such a pitiful person.

689
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,480
You'd better watch what you say.

690
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,910
Watch carefully.

691
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,230
It's you who've ruined yourself like this. Not Seo Jae Won.

692
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,570
How much further must you fall to realize that?

693
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,400
How about you? Why Seo Jae Won?

694
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,860
She wasn't by your side when you were lost and struggling.

695
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,330
I'm the one who was by your side then.

696
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,780
You're right.

697
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,250
That's been stopping me all this time.

698
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,690
But I'll cut you off without lingering feelings.

699
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,810
Even if I have to cut off my ankle.

700
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,090
That way, I'd be able to pay you back.

701
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,940
Just wait for a while and see.

702
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,430
Do you know what I regret the most?

703
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,920
Holding your hand when you wanted to die seven years ago.

704
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,570
What you said just now...

705
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,100
is very hurtful.

706
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,280
I wanted to be understood by you a tiny bit.

707
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,770
I guess I was asking for too much.

708
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,410
Su Gyeong.

709
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,880
I'm sorry for making a difficult request.

710
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,400
Let's have dinner together afterward.

711
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,620
 Derêve Shareholders' Meeting

712
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,440
 Seo Jae Won

713
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,900
Doctor, you have a visitor.

714
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,800
Didn't I mention I have no appointments this morning?

715
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,470
It's not that. He's here because of Ms. Seo Jae Won.

716
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,600
- Hello, Doctor.
 - Oh, yes. Hello

717
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,130
I'm Yoon Te Oh, Derêve's design team leader.

718
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,030
Oh, I see.

719
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,980
You're here regarding Ms. Seo Jae Won?

720
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,250
Yes.

721
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,490
Ms. Seo asked me to come. You don't have to hide it from me.

722
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,290
What did she ask you to do?

723
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:33,770
I heard you're her psychiatrist and a friend.

724
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,130
Me?

725
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,210
Aren't you?

726
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:44,060
I d-don't have a personal relationship with Ms. Seo.

727
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,490
I-I've never even met her.

728
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,210
Looks like you're mistaken.

729
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,830
No, no. There's no way, Te Oh.

730
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,520
Okay.

731
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,820
 Flower therapy. Have you heard of it?

732
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,220
 According to a study, the scent of flowers reduces stress...

733
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,290
 You heal just by smelling.

734
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:39,500
 Your husband, father, and Yun Te Oh...

735
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,890
 Is that man...

736
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,360
 How about other people's situations?

737
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,890
 They might not have anything to do with me.

738
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,430
 You want to believe it's not true, right?

739
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,540
 Why didn't you take the medicine?

740
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,500
 There was an important presentation.

741
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,300
 I thought a few days would be fine.

742
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,380
 You should accept it now.

743
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,190
 Your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong is over.

744
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,010
 Su Gyeong.

745
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,380
 I'm sorry for making a difficult request.

746
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,540
 Let's have dinner together afterward.

747
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,680
 The number you dialed does not exist.

748
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,870
 Please check and dial again.

749
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:39,870

750
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,590
Just one moment.

751
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,970
 I'm different from Mom.

752
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,220
 I'll never end things this way.

753
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:23,080
♫  What would it have been like if we hadn't become like this?  ♫

754
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,860
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

755
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,870
♫  It's scattered through the empty darkness  ♫

756
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:35,990
♫  I wanna know  ♫

757
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,700
♫  You blow in  ♫

758
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:45,970
♫  I wanna know  ♫

759
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,990
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch  ♫

760
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:53,860
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

761
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,710
♫  I'm not okay. I can't hear your voice  ♫

762
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:03,710
♫  I picture us who are only in my dream  ♫

763
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,700
♫  I will cling to it   ♫

764
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:11,440
♫  On the truth which is harsh, the aborted ending,  ♫

765
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,440
♫  Us at the time  ♫

766
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,430
♫   Will you also look back sometimes?  ♫

767
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,770
 Time to take your medicine, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

768
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:25,320
 I think I have a lot of things to do once I get discharged.

769
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,900
 I heard you'll be the artist for Derêve's project.

770
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,190
 Good luck with it. It's your company from now on, too.

771
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,600
 Please continue to keep an eye on them.

772
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,570
 You never know what Kwon Yun Jin and Kwon Yeong Ik would do.

773
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:37,750
 I heard Heo Sun Yeong's case will have a new detective in charge.

774
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,070
 I think you should watch out.

775
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:42,110
 How could you use an innocent child as a shield?

776
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,170
 She was mine from the beginning.

777
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,510
 How should I take care of it?

778
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,010
 Let me manage it myself.

779
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:53,290
 I'm making plans and getting things done one by one starting now.
