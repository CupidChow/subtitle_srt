 Jang Na Ra

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,910

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,980

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,130
 Kim Hong Pa

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,270

 My Happy Ending

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,170
 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents, and situations in this drama are fictitious.

9
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,160
I found this in Kim Mi So's house.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,140
They're the letters she and Seo Jae Won exchanged.

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,330
The document Kim Sang Beom manipulated couldn't be tracked because it was physically delivered.

12
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,940
And Kim Mi So disappeared a long time ago.

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,390
 From Seo Jae Won

14
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,530
I did my last assignment by looking into Kim Sang Beom.

15
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,320
I don't have a reason to be by your side.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,550
Is it because of Yun Jin?

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,440
 Seo Jae Won set things up properly.

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,380
I think she took care of Kim Sang Beom using the Minister.

19
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,210
Got it.

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,480
 My Happy Ending

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,880
By the way, I didn't know Kwon Yeong Ik would move so quickly.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,760
Kwon Yeong Ik is someone...

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,780
who does anything it takes to hide his flaws.

24
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,850
I've watched him for 30 years, you know.

25
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,680
He deceived people by running a scholarship foundation.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
He used the students as his trophies if they became successful, and if they didn't...

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,060
he made them dip their hands in dirty water for him.

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,000
That's the kind of person he is.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,060
 Episode 12

30
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,700
 Episode 12   
  I'll get going.

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,310
Let me drive you home.

32
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,230
I'm really okay.

33
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,130
I'll take a walk for a bit after I drop you off.

34
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,340
Don't worry so much.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,370
Let's go.

36
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,690
Te Oh.

37
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:49,990

38
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,480
- I checked everywhere. 
 - Thank you. You can leave now.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,030
How could I leave? There's no way I will.

40
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,010
Will you really not leave?

41
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,920
What if someone breaks in like just now?

42
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,560
I won't leave.

43
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,810
Do as you'd like.

44
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,800
You finally took a step forward.

45
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,600
You did well, considering how worried you were.

46
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,430
It went the way you planned it.

47
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,720
Are you afraid?

48
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,540
Is it harsher than you thought?

49
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,460
You're afraid, I see.

50
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,290
You're afraid to lose your loved ones again.

51
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,350
Good morning.

52
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,350
How is it?

53
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,130
It's not too bad.

54
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,900
Seriously?

55
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,090
Well, isn't this considered excellent?

56
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,140
Yes, let's say it is.

57
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,340
I'll request a leave of absence from work.

58
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,530
All of a sudden?

59
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,620
We'll get busier now.

60
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,150
I should be by your side.

61
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,090
Will you follow me all day?

62
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,840
- No.
 - Then, keep working.

63
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,070
Okay.

64
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,320
Did you sleep okay?

65
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,880
Well, it wasn't too bad.

66
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,040
Also, you know what today is, right?

67
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,140
Yes, I do.

68
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,930
She asked to be called an artist, not a CEO today.

69
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,180
Let's welcome Artist Kwon Yun Jin, whom you've been waiting for, and hear from her.

70
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,600
Welcome her with warm applause.

71
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,590
Hello, I'm Kwon Yun Jin.

72
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,250
Thank you so much for making time to come here today.

73
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,520
The theme of the furniture collaboration, "Escape," meant

74
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,110
everyday emotions that change all the time.

75
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,110
 For Kwon Yun Jin's new beginning

76
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,480
Looks like you're all better.

77
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,060
I didn't know you'd be here.

78
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,970
I had to come.

79
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,920
I wanted to see the Minister, too.

80
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,230
Everything's good, right?

81
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,070
- Let's cut to the chase. 
- Say it here?

82
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,360
Do you want me to get you a stage or something?

83
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,250
The first time I felt certain was at the police station.

84
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,050
I could just tell from your facial expressions and eyes.

85
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,100
You did it, didn't you?

86
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,790
Nam Tae Ju helped you, didn't he?

87
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,120
I was curious.

88
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,530
Why at a factory lot that he's never been to?

89
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,360
An unsolved murder case happened there when Nam Tae Ju was a detective.

90
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,670
He knew well that...

91
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,540
it was a good spot to kill someone.

92
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,270
I thought you had recovered since you were discharged.

93
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,000
I could call you delusional at this rate.

94
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,520
Wait just a while.

95
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,010
It won't take long.

96
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,010
Smile.

97
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,360
They put this together to congratulate you.

98
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,500
You should smile.

99
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,180
I'll leave now.

100
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,390
Hey there.

101
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,480
Sir, could I borrow bait from you?

102
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,740
Yes, of course.

103
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,510
It doesn't look like you're from around here. How did you know this place?

104
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,480
I'm kind of disappointed you don't recognize me.

105
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,270
You...

106
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,150
They say a bad fate is still a fate.

107
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,420
Our relationship was based on money, but we were pretty close, right?

108
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,870
What are you plotting that you're here?

109
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,370
What do you mean, plot?

110
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,470
CEO Seo seemed very busy these days.

111
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,910
I wanted to say hello on her behalf.

112
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,190
I won't forgive you if you mess with Jae Won.

113
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,260
Gosh, how scary. Geez...

114
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,390
Your love is so touching.

115
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,360
By the way, does CEO Seo know that?

116
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,800
That you're a murderer?

117
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,630
 Heo Sun Yeong

118
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,210
Honey, I'm here.

119
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,560
You must've missed Ah Rin. I'm sorry I couldn't bring her.

120
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,870
She's in the US right now.

121
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,260
She studied English with you a lot.

122
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,090
She's apparently doing well, thanks to you.

123
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,520
Isn't that a relief?

124
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,500
Sun Yeong.

125
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,580
I'll be punished for everything.

126
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,830
I want you to protect Ah Rin.

127
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,410
We meet again.

128
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,510
The weather is so nice today.

129
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,180
I made it clear that I have nothing more to say.

130
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,940
That's just what detectives do.

131
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,190
We check what we checked already.

132
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,250
You remember this, right?

133
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,070
I found it interesting.

134
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,300
Heo Sun Yeong, Seo Jae Won, and Kwon Yun Jin.

135
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,480
This video explains the three of your relationships effectively.

136
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,530
And let's not forget about Kim Sang Beom.

137
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,280
How do you think I'd look at his accident?

138
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,460
I'm sure you know the answer, Detective.

139
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,500
You must be busy.

140
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,720
Since you're on Kim Sang Beom's case, too.

141
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,510
How did you know I took on that case?

142
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,820
I read an article about it.

143
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,140
Oh, the article.

144
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,030
I'm not in charge of that case, too.

145
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,110
Investigating Mr. Heo Sun Yeong's case

146
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,870
made me think the two cases might be related.

147
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,780
Is that so?

148
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,700
Let me change the question.

149
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,280
Do you think it was a coincidence that

150
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,930
Kim Sang Beom got into an accident like that now?

151
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,990
Maybe it's just karma.

152
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,230
Do you think Mr. Heo died for the same reason?

153
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,100
That it wasn't an ordinary crime of passion?

154
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,090
It didn't happen in the heat of the moment, right?

155
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,490
I think you should interrogate in the interrogation room.

156
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,590
You're done, right?

157
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,580
Enjoy.

158
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,450
How's the atmosphere these days?

159
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,850
- What about Oh Su Jin?
 - Well, the thing is...

160
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,790
Lately, Detective Oh has been... Geez.

161
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,360
What about me?

162
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,730
Well...

163
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,020
Keep going.

164
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,140
I-I'm saying you're busy.

165
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,090
What brings you here, Tae Ju?

166
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,660
What do you want that you're harassing Detective Lee this time?

167
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,310
You haven't changed at all.

168
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,150
You haven't changed, either. Oh, right.

169
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,020
I was thinking of you today.

170
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,300
I happened to stop by where Eonni is.

171
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,100
It was decorated more nicely than I thought. I suppose you visit her often.

172
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,000
Right, her memorial day is coming soon, right?

173
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,390
Can you stop being nosy all the time?

174
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,440
You're my only colleague. I should care.

175
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,930
I heard you ended up with Heo Sun Yeong's case. Have you found anything?

176
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,580
Ask Detective Lee. He was originally in charge.

177
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,780
What does he know?

178
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,980
You ended up with it for a reason.

179
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,550
Where Heo Sun Yeong's case took place

180
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:21,950
was the same place as the unsolved case you were in charge of.

181
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,160
Wow, it's a crazy coincidence, right?

182
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,780
Is that so?

183
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,890
I can barely remember since I resigned a long time ago.

184
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,800
That's understandable.

185
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,840
 Neurosurgery  
 Dr. Lee Jin Ah?

186
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,520
She's a friend of my doctor at the ward.

187
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,820
She'll be helpful to you.

188
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,970
This has nothing to do with my request.

189
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,540
Make sure Ha Jin gets surgery.

190
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,140
- Jae Won. 
- You need to keep your promise to him.

191
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,920
And...

192
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,680
don't be a shameful father to him.

193
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,820
Hold on, Jae Won.

194
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,210
I'm

195
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,620
not sure if there's a point in telling you this now,

196
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,630
but the day Sun Yeong died,

197
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,710
Minister Kwon canceled the evening meeting and disappeared in a hurry.

198
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,030
Could that be related, by chance?

199
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,400
How long have you been waiting? You should've called me.

200
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,450
I didn't wait that long.

201
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,470
Have you eaten yet?

202
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,990
Let's go in.

203
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,360
I wanted to have rice.

204
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,250
Come on, seriously.

205
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,480
I was just joking.

206
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,730
Did anything notable happen today?

207
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,560
I met with one of Kwon Yun Jin's

208
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,590
friends that she drank with the day Professor Heo died.

209
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,890
She went to a bar with friends after 1 a.m.

210
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,100
- That means—
 - Yes.

211
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,650
She has no alibi from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., when Professor Heo

212
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,690
presumably died.

213
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,050
I think she changed the time of death on the smartwatch.

214
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,340
And another interesting thing is

215
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,200
that Kwon Yeong Ik let them take a trip abroad as a group from that day

216
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,300
as if he were trying to remove her until things quieted down.

217
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,100
 The day Sun Yeong died,

218
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,790
 Minister Kwon canceled the evening meeting and disappeared in a hurry.

219
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,630
 Could that be related, by chance?

220
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,780
 Kwon Yeong Ik took action himself?

221
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,590
 Kwon Yeong Ik was appointed as the new minister of the Ministry of Culture

222
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,350
Hasn't work been too intense lately?

223
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,650
It's not just intense.

224
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,300
She doesn't care about the quality at all.

225
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,390
I miss when CEO Seo was around.

226
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,000
It's only bad for workers like us.

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,680
The sales have been skyrocketing, thanks to the Minister's support.

228
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,060
I joined Derêve only for the work-life balance. But what the heck is this?

229
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,300
You agree with them, don't you?

230
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,970
That Seo Jae Won suits this position, not me.

231
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,950
That desk is...

232
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,380
much bigger than you think once you sit at it.

233
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,300
It comes with a lot more responsibility than you think, too.

234
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,290
Yes, I admit it.

235
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,520
But if Seo Jae Won's absence is so huge,

236
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,990
how would you explain where Derêve is now?

237
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,040
The sales are going up every day.

238
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,290
I'm doing better than anyone has.

239
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,610
What about the employees who are struggling just to lift you up?

240
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,560
I brought out their potential.

241
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,410
I'm the one who did that.

242
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,910
Maybe your father did.

243
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,300
I may lie from time to time in my life, 
  Asking art about the path of life

244
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,500
but the painting I created doesn't lie. 
 Asking art about the path of life

245
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,170
You can tell what kind of person I am when you see my painting.

246
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,890
It tells you what kind of dirty thoughts I have.

247
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,530
Art isn't just about aspiring for beauty in the end.

248
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,800
The true essence that's in it...

249
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,100
You've been well all this time, right?

250
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,740
Thanks to you.

251
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,640
I didn't get to visit you once since I've been so busy.

252
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,330
It's okay.

253
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,090
Now that I'm here instead,

254
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,830
did you like the present I sent you?

255
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,030
I received it.

256
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,310
You did something interesting.

257
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,310
I'm glad you liked it.

258
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,050
I picked it out very carefully.

259
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,230
It was difficult for you to get there.

260
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,410
You can't fall by tripping just once.

261
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,230
Did you think

262
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,100
you could threaten me with just that?

263
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,540
You weren't threatened, but you moved quickly.

264
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,780
Did you rush to kill...

265
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,380
my husband like that, too?

266
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,040
Because you have so much to protect?

267
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,490
You think you could just say anything?

268
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,520
I think I've given you many opportunities in the past.

269
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,170
Instead, you came this far by using me.

270
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,790
You still have a long way to go. Well, so...

271
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,100
is Yun Jin as good as me?

272
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,630
What?

273
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,990
You used me as Yun Jin's running mate.

274
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,160
I wonder how you must've felt when I overtook her.

275
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,340
Yun Jin probably doesn't know...

276
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,450
how much love you have for her.

277
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,510
 You'll put the Chairman in a difficult spot this way, not me.

278
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:09,300
 10 months ago

279
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,200
 Your father insisted on this after learning Seo Jae Won was on meds.

280
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,760
 Did you know?

281
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,370
What's this about?

282
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,940
I said what is it?

283
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,580
How could you do this to me?

284
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,870
What have you been doing all this time, anyway?

285
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,150
What have I done, you say?

286
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,900
Who said you could behave like this?

287
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't you know how I've been living for the past seven years?

288
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,620
Don't you know how I've been enduring a hellish time?

289
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,530
But it was all...

290
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,820
your doing, not Seo Jae Won's?

291
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,720
How could you be so cruel to me? How?

292
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,690
He's always been that way.

293
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,850
All I did was answer the questions.

294
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,390
No matter what I said,

295
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,140
it would've happened, anyway.

296
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,160
Are you... serious right now?

297
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,190
It would've been fine if you had never dated him.

298
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,120
Why did you have to choose someone like him?

299
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,740
Am I really...

300
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,130
your daughter?

301
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,030
Do you even think of me as your daughter?

302
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,870
Because of what you did...

303
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,100
- Because of that, I— 
 - Just be glad it ended up this way.

304
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,640
Your life would've been over if you'd had that scumbag's baby.

305
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,280
You knew.

306
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,710
You knew?

307
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,580
You knew about it?

308
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,740
Of all the people,

309
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,730
you can't be doing this to me.

310
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,300
You can't be doing this to me!

311
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,390
You're supposed to be my father.

312
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,440
You're supposed to be my father!

313
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,430
How could you do this to me?

314
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,790
You didn't just...

315
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,290
kill my baby.

316
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,050
You killed me, too.

317
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,980
How could you do this to me?

318
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,950
How could you do this to me?

319
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
 Team Leader Yun Te Oh

320
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,580
 Nam Tae Ju. A police officer took a bribe.

321
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,390
 A body of a man in his 30s found... no CCTVs in the area...

322
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,160
 Investigation of a murder at Myeongyang Industrial Complex faced difficulty

323
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,250
Long time no see, CEO Seo.

324
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,170
You tried hard,

325
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,860
but it's not good enough. None of that is a secret.

326
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,990
There are way more interesting things than those.

327
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,280
Let's talk about that later.

328
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,370
It won't be fun to reveal everything now.

329
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,850
You knew I'd come, didn't you?

330
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,710
The audio file you're looking for desperately...

331
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,070
isn't here.

332
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,980
Although you don't seem interested in finding it.

333
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,610
You changed a lot while you were hospitalized.

334
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,850
Hand me the evidence you have.

335
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,590
I'm sure you kept evidence while cleaning up after

336
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,360
Kwon Yeong Ik and Kwon Yun Jin.

337
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,880
Seriously.

338
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,000
Wow.

339
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,270
What if I didn't?

340
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,930
Even if I did, why would I?

341
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,570
Because I have more money than Kwon Yun Jin.

342
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,750
I'll pay you as much as you want.

343
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,720
You knew I'd come,

344
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,760
but you don't know the reason.

345
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,020
You're disposable, too, after all.

346
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,290
You'll be thrown out as well.

347
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,320
Come to me then.

348
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,790
You're the only one who cares for me.

349
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,900
You're making me feel weak.

350
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,730
Seo Jae Won.

351
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:14,980

352
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,200
Stop, stop...

353
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,610
Go check on CEO Seo. Go.

354
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,750
Are you okay, Ms. Seo?

355
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm okay.

356
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,740
He came in through this door.

357
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,520
I'll call the security company.

358
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,210
Let's change the passcode first.

359
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,070
No, pack your things first.

360
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,320
I think we should go to my place or somewhere else.

361
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm not going.

362
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,000
- I'll stay here.
 - This happened for the second time.

363
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Nam Tae Ju came inside the house. How can you say that?

364
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,360
That's exactly what they want.

365
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,940
They're waiting for me to react and be afraid.

366
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,170
Are you making Ah Rin's favorite fried rice?

367
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,630
It must be nighttime in the US.

368
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,990
Should we do a video chat?

369
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,050
Something serious happened last night. Don't you want to be comforted?

370
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,560
Will you keep swallowing it like this?

371
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,280
How is it different from the past, then?

372
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,230
Are you okay?

373
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,690
Yes.

374
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,070
Yes, I'm okay.

375
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,890
It's really tasty.

376
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm glad I didn't make it.

377
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,670
Let's eat quickly and leave.

378
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,990
We're busy today.

379
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,230
Thank you for your courage  to do this.

380
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,530
I'm sure it'll be very helpful.

381
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,130
I'm not sure.

382
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,950
This probably won't be enough.

383
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,840
Even if we prove the Minister's crime,

384
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,000
he'll likely pay a fine or be put on probation.

385
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,900
It's okay. The National Assembly's inspection is coming up soon.

386
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,570
Being investigated itself would affect him enough.

387
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,220
Please thank Jae Won for me.

388
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,630
He was able to get surgery, thanks to her.

389
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,200
Okay.

390
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,830
What do you plan to do now?

391
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,000
It'd be suspicious if I quit right away.

392
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,010
I'll quit when the time comes.

393
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,170
Okay, then.

394
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,370
Call me anytime if something comes up.

395
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,120
Okay.

396
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,830
A valuable guest

397
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,670
brought a precious present.

398
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm flattered.

399
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:03,190
I wasn't sure what to bring since this is my first time visiting you.

400
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,110
I was thinking of gifting you something expensive,

401
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,510
but I thought you might find it troublesome.

402
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,470
It feels like you, whom I have never met before, seem to

403
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,700
read my mind better than the ones I've known for decades.

404
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,810
I thought it would suit you perfectly.

405
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,550
It's very pretty.

406
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,260
It's

407
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,900
fun to look at the curves of the leaves of this orchid.

408
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,600
You certainly are knowledgeable.

409
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,450
Orchids are often compared to a hermit who lives

410
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,780
gracefully far away from the secular world.

411
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,700
Do you think it'd be possible?

412
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,660
It doesn't matter to me since I'm an old man who likes to sit here

413
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,130
and enjoy the scenery.

414
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,330
You don't have to get splashed with muddy water.

415
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,570
I should get going now.

416
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,040
See you tomorrow, Seung Gyu.

417
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,090
We set aside one big obstacle.

418
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,080
He could change his mind anytime.

419
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,130
We need to be careful.

420
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,810
Hey, Seong Hui.

421
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,620
 Seung Gyu woke up, Ms. Seo.

422
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,640
Yes.

423
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,520
Okay, got it.

424
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,380
Seung Gyu woke up.

425
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,560
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

426
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,790
Please check the vital signs.

427
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,040
Thankfully, there are no serious problems.

428
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,480
But they still need to keep an eye on him.

429
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,160
Seong Hui, let's step out for a second.

430
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,450
I'm sorry.

431
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,680
You must've gone through a lot.

432
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,770
I was so angry,

433
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,330
and I couldn't believe it at first.

434
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,680
I was thinking of leaving him whether he died or not.

435
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,330
But I thought I should listen to his side of the story

436
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,210
and wait until he wakes up, at least.

437
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,000
What are you going to do?

438
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,000
- CEO Kwon.
 - I'm thinking right now.

439
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,910
Thinking won't fix this issue.

440
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:37,510
There's no need for us to make a move now.

441
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,110
We still have time.

442
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,640
She won't use Baek Seung Gyu immediately.

443
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,150
You're so sure.

444
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,510
Jae Won would be like that.

445
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,960
What kind of deal...

446
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,310
did Jae Won suggest?

447
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,870
Deal?

448
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,320
Did you think I wouldn't know, by chance?

449
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,670
There's no way she just let you go.

450
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,510
She said she'd pay me more than you.

451
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:21,680
She said, "There's no way you didn't save evidence while cleaning up."

452
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,820
It sounds like...

453
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,730
you have evidence.

454
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,480
How disappointing.

455
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,950
How could that be?

456
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,510
Just look who I'm with right now.

457
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,680
Keep looking.

458
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,740
What is it?

459
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,980
Minister, you need to see the news.

460
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,050
 Here's breaking news.

461
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,790
 Yein Scholarship Foundation, an art scholarship foundation, is being

462
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,810
 accused of accepting hundreds of millions won in bribes,

463
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,690
 embezzling donation money and corrupt recruitment.

464
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:50,390
 The Prosecutors' Office initiated a search and seizure procedure.

465
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,140
 Yein Scholarship Foundation was founded by Minister Kwon Yeong Ik...

466
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,460
 Yes, Minister.

467
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,580
I need to schedule a meeting with Assemblyman Park immediately.

468
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,610
I have a lot to discuss with him.

469
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:05,210
Well, you won't be able to see him since his schedule is full right now.

470
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,210
What are you talking about?

471
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,240
 I'll hang up now.

472
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:39,850
 For accepting hundreds of millions won in bribes, embezzling donation money

473
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,470
 and corrupt recruitment.

474
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,660
 Request for leave of absence

475
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,400
- What's this?
 - I want to take a break

476
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,750
for about six months.

477
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,840
Do you think I'll accept this?

478
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,030
I've never taken a break for four years.

479
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,310
But I think I can take a break now

480
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,370
that we have a new CEO who suits the position.

481
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,960
Do you find this funny?

482
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,200
I'm being serious.

483
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,030
Is something going on, by the way?

484
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,930
You don't look so happy.

485
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,130
You guys made a mistake.

486
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,200
Derêve will end up getting hurt, too.

487
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Maybe you're the only one who's getting hurt.

488
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,660
Baek Seung Gyu...

489
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,020
Where did you hide him?

490
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,560
 You have your family, your company,

491
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,650
 and your perfect image. You have so much to lose,

492
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,920
 but I don't.

493
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,950
 I can give up on family and art, too.

494
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,120
 But can you?

495
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,490
Seo Jae Won did work with Assemblyman Park.

496
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,880
How about my payment...

497
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,410
What's this?

498
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,380
It's a scoop you'd be very interested in.

499
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,840
But I get to decide when to publish.

500
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,870
 Pesticide intake case at a closed factory

501
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,210
 Murder weapon No.

502
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,460
 Baek Seung Gyu

503
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,040
 Kwon Yeong Ik

504
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,420
 Nam Tae Ju

505
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,770
 Heo Sun Yeong, Kwon Yun Jin – affair

506
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,360
Sunbaenim, aren't you clocking out?

507
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,020
I had to look over some files.

508
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,100
- I see.
 - How about you?

509
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,050
I'm picking up something, too.

510
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,110
- Detective Lee.
 - Yes.

511
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:04,270
What was the reason Seo Jae Won was arrested without a warrant?

512
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,210
The crime scene wasn't their home

513
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,900
and he was found in a factory complex far away from it.

514
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:16,270
The circumstantial evidence was very clear, as you know.

515
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,290
The divorce article and the issue at the company, too.

516
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,250
Were there any other suspects besides Seo Jae Won?

517
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,800
How about Kim Sang Beom or Kwon Yun Jin?

518
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,070
It wasn't necessary to investigate them since they both had alibis.

519
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,250
Okay, then.

520
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,870
I'll leave you to it, then.

521
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,410
He didn't know Kwon Yun Jin's alibi was false?

522
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,780
Why can't we reach Assemblyman Park?

523
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,930
What are his secretaries doing?

524
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,250
We keep trying to reach him.

525
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,170
What are you doing at home?

526
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,980
I suppose you can't reach Assemblyman Park.

527
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,300
Shouldn't you make a decision now?

528
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,510
 Kwon Yeong Ik was definitely at the crime scene.

529
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,530
 Because the audio file would've hurt him the most.

530
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,920
 How about Kwon Yun Jin, then?

531
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,040
How about Nam Tae Ju?

532
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,930
He came to your house, too.

533
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:57,480
You really could've died, Jae Won.

534
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,680
Whose side is Nam Tae Ju on?

535
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,190
Kwon Yeong Ik? Kwon Yun Jin?

536
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,900
Is this really what Sun Yeong would want?

537
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,590
- I need something more definitive.
 - Will you really be okay like this?

538
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,210
To find out what they're thinking—

539
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,180
How long do you think you can ignore me?

540
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:19,180
I won't disappear, Jae Won.

541
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,590
 You can't go in there!

542
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,590
Please leave.

543
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,380
I'll call you back.

544
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,950
You must be busy. Sorry for visiting you again.

545
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,960
You became pretty reckless.

546
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,450
Don't you know where you are?

547
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,100
I know where I am.

548
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,100
I'm at Minister Kwon Yeong Ik's last stop in his political career.

549
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,200
You think you could hurt me with some tabloid rumor?

550
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,840
How about...

551
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,880
this, then?

552
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,370
 Seung Gyu...

553
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,150
 Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

554
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:29,880
 It couldn't be helped because he threatened to kill us both.

555
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,860
 Is he dead?

556
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,880
 What do I do now, Father?

557
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,100
 Come home immediately.

558
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:50,270
Is this the audio file you've been so desperately looking for?

559
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:54,990
It doesn't say Yun Jin pushed him at all.

560
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,110
You're right.

561
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,580
She said he fell, not that he was pushed.

562
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,510
But if this file gets released,

563
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:07,230
it won't matter if Baek Seung Gyu was pushed or not.

564
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,010
What matters is you knew about this but tried to cover it up.

565
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,420
On top of that...

566
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,010
Seung Gyu's awake.

567
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,600
Do you think...

568
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,430
I'll just let you be?

569
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,530
Don't let me be.

570
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,030
- What did you say?
 - You'll have to decide before you come.

571
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,610
Whether to protect your minister position

572
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,550
or your daughter.

573
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,550
 Restricted area

574
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,880
Hello.

575
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,230
I'm here.

576
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,980
Are you feeling okay?

577
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,250
Don't overdo it.

578
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,810
By the way,

579
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,610
where's CEO Seo...

580
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,200
She'll be here soon.

581
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,400
- Have you eaten?
 - I ate.

582
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,340
You made it.

583
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,720
Seong Hui.

584
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,410
You've been through a lot.

585
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,810
I-I'm so sorry, CEO Seo.

586
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,720
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,560
Isn't what we're planning too dangerous?

588
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,640
We can't drag them outside if we don't do that.

589
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,180
Because what they ultimately want is me.

590
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,810
What if something bad happens to you?

591
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,310
Why would that happen?

592
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,180
 Team Leader Yun Te Oh

593
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,040
We get to meet again like this.

594
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:34,960

595
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,440
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

596
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,650
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

597
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:52,390
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

598
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:56,430
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

599
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,460
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

600
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:04,290
♫  There is a night like  ♫

601
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:09,770
♫  a lie hidden within it  ♫

602
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,810
♫  Following a darkened path  ♫

603
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,590
♫  I walked aimlessly and just like that  ♫

604
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:25,740
♫  Even if I'm abandoned in the world, will my heart feel better?  ♫

605
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,490

607

 My Happy Ending

608
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,830
 You would've done the same if you were me.

609
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,510
 He was hiding like a rat.

610
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,130
 Don't assume you know everything.

611
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,090
 I've been thinking about that bastard.

612
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,440
 Was he perhaps a Yein Foundation scholarship student?

613
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,670
 I heard something unsavory recently.

614
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,910
 You'll have to be responsible for what you said.

615
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:57,040
 I thought I overcame everything, but it's still the same.

616
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,800
 Look at me. I'll be by your side.

617
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,440
 I said I'm here to give you a gift. I thought you'd like it.

618
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,430
 Gosh, you're no fun.

619
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,080
♫  There is a night like a lie...  ♫
