 My Happy Ending

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,460
I got it!

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,080
What?

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,350
Huh?

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,030
 Episode 11  
 I was tricked.

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,870
 Episode 11  
 I told you to be patient.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,750
Grandpa, this is what they mean by fishing your life away, right?

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,200
My goodness...

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,970
That's right.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,710
The person who said that phrase first

19
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,640
must've been someone who couldn't catch a fish.

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,380
Yes, yes.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,610
Oh? I got one.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,610
Oh, hey, hey!

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,400
- You got it!
 - Wow.

24
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,100
I wish Mom and Dad were here, too.

25
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,790
Why? Do you not like Grandpa?

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,020
No. Of course, I do. You're the best.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,850
Aigoo, thank you.

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,310
Okay, do you want to try again?

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,770
Okay.

30
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,770
All right.

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,060
When will I catch one?

32
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,090
I wonder what I'll catch this time. Aigoo...

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,410
 Derêve

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,120
Hello.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,510
Hello, CEO.

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,620
- Hello.
 - Hello.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,110
Welcome, CEO.

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,170
 CEO Kwon Yoon Jin

39
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:39,910

40
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,240
Ms. Seo, it's time to take medicine.

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,710
 Isolation room: A confined ward to prevent patients from causing harm to themselves or others.

42
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,790
What's your name?

43
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,850
Seo Jae Won.

44
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,040
 Seo Jae Won

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,820
Okay.

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,310
Let me give you the medicine.

47
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,240
Let me check that it went in.

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Could you say "ah"?

49
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,520
Hello, Minister.

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,700
Welcome.

51
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,130
Congratulations on being appointed as a minister.

52
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,940
Thank you. Have a seat.

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,850
The fact that Seo Jae Won resigned and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital

54
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,770
appears to have been a good thing for Derêve.

55
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,310
I'm thinking of using this as an opportunity to change Derêve's image.

56
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,700
There are two CEOs. I'm sure you'll do a good job.

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,780
Thank you, Minister.

58
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,760
I heard you'll be the artist for Derêve's project.

59
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,790
Finish it up well and get to know the higher-ups at the company.

60
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,950
It's your company from now on, too.

61
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,190
I don't think the company will be so thrilled.

62
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,460
That'll prove your competence.

63
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,140
You have CEO Park. Make sure to discuss things with him.

64
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,850
Let's call it a day today.

65
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,670
Oh, okay.

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,460
I'll see myself out, then.

67
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,630
How's Seo Jae Won?

68
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,890
What could she do while locked in a psychiatric ward?

69
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,230
Don't worry so much.

70
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,230
We need to find her.

71
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,990
It was just some audio file.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,250
You acted too rashly.

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,260
If that were revealed,

74
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,430
we wouldn't be where we are now.

75
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,150
Do you understand?

76
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,980
Is the ward treating you okay?

77
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,410
Yes, yes.

78
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,500
Have you had the urge to cause self-harm again?

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,190
No, no. I haven't.

80
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,280
Could you tell me what happened that day again?

81
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,630
The day you found out about your husband's affair,

82
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,380
you had a fall at the Han River, correct?

83
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,180
Was it a mistake because you were drunk?

84
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,280
Considering the height of the railing, it's difficult to fall

85
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,350
by mistake, even though you were drunk.

86
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,030
I wasn't alone that day.

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,300
Someone followed me and threatened me.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,290
Who was that?

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,060
- I didn't get to see the face. 
- Was the face covered?

90
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,440
I don't remember that.

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,230
Wasn't it Baek Seung Gyu who had a falling accident recently?

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,390
If you fell due to a threat, why didn't you notify the police immediately?

93
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,500
Because I didn't want it to get blown out of proportion. At the time, I...

94
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,280
suspected it was my father,

95
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,430
husband, or one of my colleagues.

96
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,070
I completely understand your suspicion, considering the circumstances, but...

97
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,460
Was there something you noticed about

98
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,590
the culprit at the time?

99
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,400
 What was their body type?

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,700
What were they wearing? Do you not remember that, either?

101
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,670
That's interesting.

102
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,510
You remember the incident,

103
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,210
but you can't remember what the culprit looked like.

104
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,090
Let's move on.

105
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,430
How did you acquire the medicine?

106
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,820
It must've been impossible to get without a prescription.

107
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,490
I heard you talked about Dr. Jo Su Gyeong.

108
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,070
Is she related, by chance?

109
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,450
Su Gyeong is—

110
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,710
You're referring to her casually.

111
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,040
Because she's my long-time friend.

112
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,530
By chance, can you still...

113
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,530
see Dr. Jo Su Gyeong?

114
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,110
 It's difficult to fall by mistake.

115
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,910
 What was their body type?

116
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,190
 What were they wearing?

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,210
I'll draw blood to monitor drug levels.

118
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,130
 You remember the incident,

119
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,780
 but you can't remember what the culprit looked like.

120
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,150
 It's okay.

121
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,930
Did you have a nightmare again?

122
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,580
What's wrong, Jae Won?

123
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,090
Are you sure you're okay?

124
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,050
Looks like you're having a hard time.

125
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,990
 How are you feeling today?

126
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,910
I feel fine.

127
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,950
Did you have a nightmare last night, too?

128
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,650
Yes.

129
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,680
Why do you think you keep having the same dream?

130
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,730
The fact that you have repetitive dreams

131
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,670
about the situation you were in

132
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,870
must be because you're

133
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,610
reminding yourself of some unresolved issues.

134
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,610
 Think about it.

135
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,620
 Maybe you've been avoiding it

136
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,870
 without facing it directly all this time.

137
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,920
 Why do you think you keep having the same dream?

138
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,160
 Have you had the urge to cause self-harm again?

139
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,090
 Jae Won, do you remember when we were in middle school?

140
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,980
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

141
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,940

155

 Why don't you tell me now?

156
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,180
 I have no clue.

157
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,590
 I thought I escaped it,

158
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,430
 but why am I still inside the dark tunnel?

159

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,930
 Why have I been fooling myself?

164
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,460
 Maybe I turned myself into a monster

165
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,400
 to escape from reality.

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,840
♫  I draw us who are only in my dream  ♫

168
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm a patient who was admitted here six times due to alcohol addiction.

169
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,250
My family recommended the previous times.

170
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,540
I was actually forced, but

171
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,540
for the first time, I... volunteered to admit myself.

172
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,730
My wife divorced me, my children left, and I was violent toward my mother, too.

173
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,500
I came here because I wanted to become a human before I turned into an animal.

174
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,090
That's all.

175
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,800
Thank you.

176
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,130
Should we hear from Ms. Seo Jae Won next?

177
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,510
I...

178
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,260
I...

179
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,990
have had manic depressive disorder for a long time.

180
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,950
I've had it for so long that I don't even remember when it started.

181
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,140
And throughout that long time, I've been hiding it from everyone.

182
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,020
Even from my husband.

183
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:19,580
I didn't want my family to be hurt due to my condition.

184
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,350
Could you wrap this for me?

185
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,670
Okay.

186
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,390
Is it true that Seo Jae Won was admitted to a psychiatric hospital?

187
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,860
She looked fine on TV.

188
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know how she completely fooled everyone.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,410
Who's raising the kid, then? The father is dead and gone, too.

190
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,100
Gosh, I just pity the kid.

191
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,210
- Here's your change.
 - Oh, yes.

192
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,460
- Thank you. Good luck with your business. 
- Yes, take care.

193
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,430
What will she do now that her parents are gone?

194
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,550
Isn't this Seo Jae Won's daughter?

195
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,320
It is.

196
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,990
So, why did you paint her?

197
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,470
By chance,

198
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,400
is it due to affection, guilt, or something like that?

199
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,780
Mr. Nam, are you happy with your life right now?

200
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,130
Seriously.

201
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,950
Why are you suddenly asking that?

202
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,990
I heard you lost your wife's hospital money through gambling.

203
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,340
You heard that fairytale somewhere.

204
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,600
It's something completely meaningless from the past.

205
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,510
Your gambling partner from your meaningless past

206
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,050
was Seo Jae Won's mother,

207
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,050
Jeong Mi Hyang?

208
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,800
You know more than necessary.

209
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,570
How long will you devote yourself to such an empty pleasure?

210
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,230
Pleasure?

211
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,280
Pleasure...

212
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,350
The one who can truly realize what you want

213
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,960
is neither Seo Jae Won nor my father.

214
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,700
You'll realize my dream?

215
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,590
A rich girl like you?

216
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,050
Is that all you think of me?

217
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,550
I'm so disappointed.

218
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,190
Would you be able to handle it?

219
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,790
I think you already made up your mind.

220
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,060
We have guests.

221
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,870
- Hello, sir.
 - Hi.

222
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,140
Nice to meet you.

223
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,130
This is my sister, whom I said I'd bring along.

224
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,740
Oh, okay. Welcome. Good to see you.

225
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,310
Well, we were both adopted.

226
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,620
Oh, I see. Your parents are great people.

227
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,440
Thank you.

228
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,060
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

229
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,540
It's tasty. What's this?

230
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,460
Gamju?

231
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,050
Oh? You speak Korean?

232
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,660
I actually speak Korean a little.

233
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,200
Oh, really?

234
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,240
How old are you?

235
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,640
I'm seven.

236
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,920
- What's your name? 
 - Ah Rin.

237
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,470
Ah Rin?

238
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm glad they're getting along better than expected.

239
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,940
I know.

240
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,050
They need to grow close quickly. This is great.

241
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,110
Sir, about what I mentioned last time—

242
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,420
I know what you're talking about.

243
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,960
I think that's the right thing to do, too.

244
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,190
My parents in the US will take good care of her.

245
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,780
Is my Jae Won doing well?

246
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,290
Yes.

247
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,700
 Scissors. Paper. Shoot.

248
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,340
I won.

249
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,020
 Rock. Scissors. Paper. Shoot.

250
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,390
I had a psychiatrist friend.

251
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,270
I used to ask her for advice all the time.

252
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,200
But from now on, I'll no longer do that.

253
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,400
Because I learned that's best for me.

254
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,550
I've been following a routine these days.

255
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:21,320
I take a walk every day, take medicine on time, and read, too.

256
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,500
I think I will have a lot of things to do once I get discharged.

257
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,060
So, I've been making plans and doing things little by little.

258
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,980
I think I did the right thing to come here.

259
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,910
Thank you.

260
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,210
Ms. Seo, let's move to a different ward.

261
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,820
Okay.

262
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,670
He's here to see Ms. Seo Jae Won.

263
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,000
Take him to the visiting room.

264
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,130
Okay. Come this way.

265
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,570
I want to get out. I don't want to be here!

266
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,100
Let me go!

267
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,620
I was very worried.

268
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,790
You look at ease.

269
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,180
Have you been well?

270
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,230
What do you think?

271
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,780
You look good.

272
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,650
That's it?

273
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,410
Seriously...

274
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,340
Have you eaten?

275
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,040
Of course.

276
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,830
The food is very good here.

277
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,220
Their rolled omelet is especially good.

278
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,740
Gosh, I'm really good at making rolled omelets.

279
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,530
Is there anything you're not good at?

280
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,930
Not much is going on, right?

281
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,430
I saw Ah Rin before I came here today.

282
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,340
How pretty.

283
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,190
My Ah Rin is so pretty.

284
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,310
Rachel met Ah Rin now, too.

285
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,580
That's great.

286
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,250
Don't you miss her?

287
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,400
What about the thing you brought me?

288
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,580
 Captivating Design  
 Please keep observing.

289
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,050
You never know what Kwon Yun Jin and Kwon Yeong Ik will do.

290
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,060
You're back again.

291
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,720
Oh, yes.

292
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,100
I haven't seen my daughter in a while.

293
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,900
I wanted to give her a surprise gift.

294
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm sure she'll be thrilled.

295
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
Right?

296
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,650
Wow, is this where you live?

297
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,090
Pretty cool, right?

298
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,280
I want to visit the US, too.

299
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,700
You can go if you want.

300
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
- Do you want to come with me?
 - Really?

301
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,230
No.

302
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,120
Grandpa won't let me.

303
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Should I try begging?

304
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,330
I need to ask my mom, too.

305
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,030
But I can't see her for now.

306
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,720
Let me help you.

307
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,160
Deal.

308
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,190
 Heo, a famous entrepreneur's husband, died. The cause of death is being investigated.

309
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,880
 Kwon Yeong Ik was appointed as the new minister of the Ministry of Culture

310
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,240
 Autopsy report

311
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,720
What's your name?

312
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
Seo Jae Won.

313
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,870
Let me check if they went down.

314
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,120
 Investigation report for the pesticide intake case at a closed factory in 2023

315
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,290
 Seoul Yongsan Police Station

316
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,770
Here's your lunch medicine, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

317
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,360
- What's your name?
 - Seo Jae Won.

318
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,720
Ah Rin.

319
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,680
Hi.

320
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
Who are you?

321
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,310
What?

322
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't you remember me?

323
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,820
I'm your mom's friend.

324
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,280
We've seen each other a few times before.

325
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,660
I guess I've seen you before.

326
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,980
I brought...

327
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,780
a present for you, Ah Rin.

328
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,220
Pardon?

329
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,420
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

330
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,610
but you like Mimi dolls?

331
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,680
Yes, I like Mimi dolls.

332
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,550
Ah Rin,

333
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,180
I'll give you my phone number.

334
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,020
Could you call me if anything happens?

335
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I'll run to you anytime you call me.

336
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,460
Ah Rin!

337
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,520
- Grandpa!
 - Yes.

338
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,420
Do you know how much I worried?

339
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,780
You left without a word.

340
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,470
Well, the thing is...

341
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,820
It's because...

342
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,410
I asked her to come with me.

343
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,980
I'll talk to her for a moment. Go on home first.

344
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,960
- Okay.
 - Okay.

345
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,640
Why are you with Ah Rin?

346
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,550
Because she's my best friend's daughter.

347
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,940
I was worried.

348
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't ever meet Ah Rin again.

349
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,290
I won't let you hurt Jae Won anymore.

350
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,780
Jae Won isn't the only one who got hurt.

351
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,890
I'll get going now.

352
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,710
Drive safely.

353
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,790
I didn't think Kwon Yun Jin would come all the way here.

354
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,580
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,910
You shouldn't be apologizing for that.

356
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,000
I really need to let Ah Rin go now.

357
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,640
I don't think we can delay it any longer.

358
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,500
Shit, why did you follow me in here?

359
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,700
I heard a new detective will be in charge of the Heo Sun Yeong case.

360
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,980
Yes. It's no longer my case.

361
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,040
Who do you think they'll assign it to?

362
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,920
Detective Oh Su Jin.

363
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,790
Oh Su Jin?

364
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,680
You mean the Oh Su Jin that I know?

365
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
Yes.

366
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,200
Geez, f***. How annoying.

367
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,560
Wow. Why did they put this on the main page? It's not a big deal.

368
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,510
Did you see this, too?

369
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,130
Detective Park, did you see this?

370
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,670
Did you see this, Team Leader?

371
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,200
This is a major case.

372
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,930
I want you to take it since you like attention.

373
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,750
I don't like attention that much.

374
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,360
 Investigation report for the pesticide intake case at a closed factory in 2023

375
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Heo Sun Yeong?

376
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,480
Heo Sun Yeong.

377
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,430
The audio file Sun Yeong left behind...

378
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,280
is probably with Seo Jae Won.

379
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,880
Please look into that quietly.

380
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,610
So, the Minister doesn't know, either?

381
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,100
- Quietly. 
- I know.

382
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,610
I heard a new detective will be in charge of the Heo Sun Yeong case.

383
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,490
- So?
 - Her name is Oh Su Jin.

384
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,990
She's not an easy one.

385
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,460
I think you'll have to be careful.

386
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,670
Wow. Your hunch was right, CEO Kwon.

387
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,560
They're quicker than I expected.

388
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,690
Hold on.

389
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,480
You expected this already,

390
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,760
and they moved accordingly?

391
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,360
That means you both knew.

392
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,920
What's this?

393
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,280
Did you want Seo Jae Won's daughter?

394
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,230
She was mine from the beginning.

395
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,120
I see.

396
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,850
She has two moms, then.

397
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,820
One of them will have to disappear.

398
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,750
 International Boarding

399
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,910
Hello?

400
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,630
I'm sorry, Dad.

401
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,570
I should've been there.

402
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,360
 What are you talking about?

403
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,180
 You just need to focus on yourself, Jae Won.

404
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,480
 Grandpa!

405
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,940
Hold on.

406
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,450
- Ah Rin.
 - Yes?

407
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,000
Mom wants to hear your voice before you leave.

408
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,100
Hello?

409
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,180
Mom!

410
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,280
Ah Rin, did you get to the airport safely?

411
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,660
 Yes.

412
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,450
Are you okay, Mom?

413
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,510
I missed you.

414
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,900
I'm sorry.

415
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,150
Ah Rin, for us to be together for a long time,

416
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,070
I think we need to be separated for a bit now.

417
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,720
Okay. I'll be back soon.

418
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,570
You're so cheerful, my Ah Rin.

419
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,430
Take good care of yourself and listen to what Eonni says.

420
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,900
The most important thing is...

421
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,350
for you to be happy. You know, right?

422
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,900
Yes.

423
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,160
You should recover from your illness while I'm gone, too.

424
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,790
Promise, okay?

425
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,960
Okay.

426
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,650
When I see you again,

427
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,090
I'll...

428
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,130
be in very good health.

429
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,530
You promised, okay?

430
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,890
Ah Rin, Mom loves you.

431
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,200
I love you, too.

432
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,140
Te Oh.

433
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,330
Ah Rin, we need to go in now.

434
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,770
I'll call you, Mom.

435
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,070
- Okay.
  - Bye.

436
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,490
Please take good care of her.

437
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,530
Don't hang up and watch.

438
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:04,120
♫  Can you make all scars just disappear?  ♫

439
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,200
Ah Rin.

440
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,220
♫  But when I close my eyes  ♫

441
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,700
♫  Both your smile in the moment which brushed by  ♫

442
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:27,570
♫  Stuck inside my heart with broken parts (Now I know)  ♫

443
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:35,840
♫  And the bland greeting in the whispered words  ♫

444
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:45,920
♫  It falls to pieces whenever you come around  ♫

445
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,300
♫  Oh why  ♫

446
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,470
 On Hot Issue Today, we'll show how Seo Jae Won is doing after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

447
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,210
- Reporter Choi.
 - Yes.

448
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,090
Seo Jae Won was charged with her husband's murder,

449
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,650
but she was released due to lack of evidence.

450
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:08,260
In the process, the fact that she was manic-depressive was revealed and shocked everyone.

451
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,200
 She's currently being treated in an isolation ward, as we understand.

452
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,230
 I think we should discuss her husband, who was murdered.

453
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,580
Even though this was a case the whole country was focusing on,

454
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,310
they still haven't found the culprit yet.

455
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:30,350
The police, who were in charge of the investigation at the time, focused on the relationship between the two.

456
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:34,670
 Visiting Room

457
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,180
You came early.

458
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,380
We have a flexible work schedule.

459
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,810
Why did you come today?

460
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,550
I told you last time.

461
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,220
Kwon Yeong Ik hired the most desired government workers in their 20s or 30s,

462
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,530
and he's trying to get nominated to join the National Assembly.

463
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,170
It's a very pretty key.

464
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,800
By the way,

465
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,250
isn't a key without a good use just a nuisance?

466
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,290
Of course.

467
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,860
You're so witty, Minister Kwon.

468
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,690
Thank you.

469
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,860
You said Seung Gyu's finger moved recently, right?

470
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,590
Yes. The doctor said it could've been just a momentary movement,

471
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,650
but we'll keep an eye on him.

472
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,850
How are things at the company?

473
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,110
Good. I feel a sense of achievement, too.

474
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,330
Just keep at it like that.

475
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,480
Make sure you don't affect what I do.

476
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,810
I heard you've been keeping Nam Tae Ju close to you lately.

477
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,760
I can manage him.

478
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,130
Nothing good will come out of getting involved with him too much.

479
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:31,110
Baek Seung Gyu's case is already a handful.

480
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,050
You're not mentioning Sun Yeong's case.

481
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,940
It's better to keep him near me.

482
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,290
I'll control him myself.

483
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,550
 Casamia

484
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,170
You're coming in late.

485
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,790
Did you stop by to see Jae Won?

486
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,020
Say hello back, at least.

487
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,500
Hello, CEO Kwon Yun Jin.

488
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,030
I'm still grateful to you, Team Leader Yun.

489
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,900
Because you decided to stay and not leave.

490
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,090
Carry on, then.

491
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,490
How's the new medicine?

492
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,690
Have you experienced any side effects?

493
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,240
No.

494
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,320
We reduced the dose a lot, and you became very stable, too.

495
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,930
Looks like you can get discharged now.

496
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,270
Thank you.

497
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,160
Make sure to keep taking the medicine.

498
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,850
Okay.

499
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,010
Hello.

500
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,990
Could I speak with you for a moment?

501
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,310
The weather's nice today.

502
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,570
Did you go out for a walk?

503
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,000
What did you come here for?

504
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:36,730
I'm Detective Oh Su Jin, newly assigned to the Heo Sun Yeong case.

505
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:42,460
I'm here to ask a few questions for the reinvestigation.

506
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,360
You came to the wrong person.

507
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,230
I would've thought that

508
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,460
if you hadn't come to a psychiatric ward to be treated.

509
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,270
When Mr. Heo died,

510
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,940
I heard you were in

511
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,860
a deep sleep in the car after taking medicine.

512
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,420
But did you know this?

513
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,840
The smartwatch Mr. Heo was wearing says

514
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,330
his heart stopped at 1:42 a.m.

515
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,300
But...

516
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,990
according to our autopsy record, it happened between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.

517
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,610
Yes.

518
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,900
You're not surprised.

519
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,230
Did you know this, then?

520
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:36,370
The day before he died, he visited Kim Sang Beom, the CEO of SB Medical

521
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,370
and swung his fist at him. Did you know?

522
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,180
I guess you didn't know that.

523
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,080
 Two months ago

524
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,270
 Are you curious why I'm doing this?

525
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,240
 Go ask your husband, then.

526
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,450
 He knows better than anyone.

527
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,340
 We found pesticide in the water bottle in the vehicle.

528
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,440
 Mr. Heo Sun Yeong was poisoned.

529
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,110
 Sun Yeong left this with me.

530
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,190
 Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

531
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,010
 Ms Seo, are you not interested?

532
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,250
 Are you satisfied with your current pay?

533
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,040
 I'll supplement it if it's not enough.

534
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,220
 Ami?

535
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,410
 What's that, anyway?

536
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,720
 This is your method.

537
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,420
 You scrape everything and run away if you can't handle it.

538
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,220
 You did that when you were 15,

539
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,650
 and seven years ago, too.

540
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,750
 CEO Seo, are you okay?

541
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,670
 You have everything.

542
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,240
 What I don't have,

543
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,920
 the things I've wanted,

544
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,240
 I'm sorry...

545
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,980
 and everything I used to have, too.

546
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,910
 Kwon Yun Jin attempted suicide seven years ago.

547
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,270
 I think she had a miscarriage.

548
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,210
 - Smile, smile. 
- Okay.

549
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,410
We're almost there. Almost there.

550
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:21,990
 Sun Yeong was looking for his daughter's biological father before he died.

551
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,680
 Subject A and Subject C are not related since their STR in the DNAs don't match.

552
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,640
 You killed Sun Yeong, didn't you?

553
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,930
 I know you're very sick,

554
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,280
 but be careful what you say.

555
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,960
 Who killed whom, exactly?

556
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,190
 I got all of my memories back.

557
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,730
 Then, you also must know now.

558
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,570
 Sun Yeong and I used to love each other—

559
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:10,000

560
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,850
You're leaving tomorrow. Did you already finish packing?

561
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,070
Yes.

562
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,990
This is the last time I will give you medicine.

563
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,310
Let me check if they went down.

564
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,890
Yes, good job.

565
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,590
What do you want to do when you get out?

566
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,490
Is there anything you want to do?

567
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,230
There isn't anything I want to do.

568
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,900
I just...

569
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,140
want to be done with everything and see my daughter.

570
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,420
Thank you for agreeing to do this interview, Minister.

571
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,990
I should be thanking you.

572
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,200
Did you find the hearing tiring at all?

573
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,640
A lot has happened to you lately, as you know.

574
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,290
It's okay to be direct with it.

575
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,470
I've indeed been going through a lot regarding CEO Seo Jae Won.

576
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:34,210
To me, it was more sad than shocking.

577
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,930
Why couldn't she take care of herself sooner?

578
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,740
I've become more attentive to people

579
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,100
around me, thanks to her.

580
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,650
I can sense how thoughtful you are.

581
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,670
I'd like to ask CEO Kwon a question this time.

582
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:58,610
You're working as both the co-CEO of Derêve and an artist.

583
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:05,120
People often compare you to Ms. Seo, the founder and CEO.

584
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,000
Does that make you feel pressured at all?

585
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,430
Not at all.

586
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,540
I actually like it.

587
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,630
It's fun to disprove the arguments one by one.

588
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,960
CEO Seo made great achievements, as you know.

589
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,560
Yes.

590
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:04,120
♫  If you follow the footsteps  ♫

591

601
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,960
How strange.

602
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,350
It's not like I never got to see you.

603
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,170
But this feels different.

604
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,540
I'm back. That's why.

605
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,560
You're really back, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

606
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,050
What? You're unemployed now.

607
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:43,000
Well, do I have to call you my ex-CEO?

608
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,920
- Or just Seo Jae Won?
 - You're pushing it.

♫  We will hold each other's hands  ♫

614
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,230
I want to keep calling your name

615
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,530
now that you're in front of me.

616
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,520
Do you need a job, by chance?

617
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,930
Are you interested in working for Derêve?

618
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,820
Think carefully. I'm recruiting you right now.

619
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,800
I refuse.

620
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,790
You'll regret it forever if you refuse now.

621
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,270
I've heard that before somewhere.

622
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,330
I thought it'd be just for a moment...

623
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,990
but a lot of things changed.

624
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,180
We need to bring it back.

625
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:59,930
♫  Even the evening star will be put to sleep  ♫

626
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,580
Drink something refreshing since you're here.

627
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,690
Please don't mind the mess in here.

628
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,730
 Nam Tae Ju. A Police Officer took a bribe.

629
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,420
 Kim Sang Beom clinical test

630
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,680
You were more serious than I thought.

631
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,480
Te Oh, while I have been in the hospital,

632
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,730
there hasn't been a day I forgot

633
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,430
that my husband died.

634
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:31,260
That Ah Rin no longer has someone she can call a dad in this world.

635
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,550
And I'm responsible for him ending up that way.

636
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,360
I'll forget everything now.

637
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,090
So, I don't forget one thing.

638
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,210
- I'll also—
 - Will you join me?

639
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,610
Pardon?

640
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,890
I'm asking you to help me.

641
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,290
Of course.

642
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,780
I should help you.

643
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,680
You might get hurt a lot.

644
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,450
You know I've already saved you many times.

645
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,600
I'll no longer be the person you've known.

646
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,380
You are a woman with many layers.

647
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,100
I'm sorry...

648
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,790
that I'm a selfish person.

649
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,510
Did you know...

650
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:31,530
that I'm a pilgrim who was saved by an angel long ago?

651
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,200
No big deal. I might as well go on a pilgrimage.

652
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,940
 What will you do if you find the culprit?

653
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,400
You already have an idea who it is.

654
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,710
What more do you want to know?

655
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,790
Jae Won, do you think you're cured?

656
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,270
You still have nightmares

657
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,700
and you still hallucinate.

658
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,020
Am I wrong?

659
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,870
Are you okay?

660
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:33,210
Well, I didn't get hit in the face that much.

661
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,440
I can cover it with the sunglasses.

662
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,360
How have you been enduring it?

663
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,510
It must've been so hard.

664
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,920
Let's talk like human beings! Okay?

665
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,120
Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

666
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,790
I told you not to talk to another man.

667
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,270
You've still got it, huh?

668
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,730
This is no good. Let me beat you more.

669
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,890
Why are you staring at me? I know you aren't much better.

670
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,050
I decided after reading the honest letter you wrote me

671
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,140
to destroy that bastard Kim Sang Beom.

672
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,100
 You appear to be a strong person.

673
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,440
 I guess you're different than me.

674
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,040
I'm not different.

675
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,370
Here's the evidence that Kim Sang Beom's company

676
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,530
manipulated the clinical trials.

677
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,520
I'm sorry...

678
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,980
for getting you involved in something difficult.

679
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,830
I'm sad that you're saying that.

680
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,500
I thought I jumped in myself.

681
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,750
Do you have evidence?

682
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,560
Do you have evidence that I manipulated the clinical trial results?

683
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,690
We received a report.

684
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,720
What's your name?

685
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,070
You're just a public prosecutor. How dare you try to intimidate me?

686
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,140
I'll remember you.

687
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,530
I'll go after you as soon as I get out.

688
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,410
I was told CEO Kim Sang Beom is being investigated by the prosecution

689
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,450
for manipulating the clinical trial results.

690
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,460
 XB Medical

691
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,120
How should I take care of this?

692
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,560
He's not exactly good at keeping his mouth shut.

693
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,760
I'll take care of it.

694
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,160
You checked the transfer conditions, right?

695
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,530
Let's stamp the seals, then.

696
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,330
I'm selling because I have a situation.

697
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,650
Consider yourself very lucky.

698
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,480
 Stock transfer agreement

699
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,550
Guess who's behind Derêve?

700
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,860
Never mind.

701
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,270
You seized an incredible opportunity just so you know.

702
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,810
How long will you be abroad? Are you sure you're coming back?

703
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,840
Don't jinx my future like that.

704
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,140
I'll come back soon. I'll be back immediately.

705
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,720
Of course, the young master won't have any issues.

706
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,030
Don't call me that. I'm the crown prince.

707
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,230
Oh, okay.

708
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:29,080
- Crown prince?
 - You're no crown prince.

709
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,450
Think about it carefully.

710
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,680
Just think about it. How dare you say you...

711
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,890
You're the biggest problem, bastard.

712
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,140
Seriously.

713
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:45,000
- How many did you drink with ice already?
 - Come on, seriously.

714
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,010
I award the ones who work hard, and I'll be awarded since I worked hard, too.

715
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,240
You should also work hard to be awarded.

716
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,090
I worked hard, too. Who's awarding me, huh?

717
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,260
Here's your award.

718
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,210
But you can't come back here.

719
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,390
Bye-bye.

720
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,200
Hey, hey, hey. I said I'll do that. Let me.

721
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,720
- Come on.
 - I know you won't.

722
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,020
This is the crown prince's treat.

723
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,080
Drink up!

724
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,460
Let's have fun!

725
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,170
Feeling good...

726
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,400
Geez, come on.

727
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,560
Gosh, feeling good. Geez.

728
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,200
- I called a driver. 
- I'm so drunk.

729
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,390
- Excuse me.
 - Yes. Hold on.

730
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,860
Here's the car key.

731
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,370
The car is around the corner.

732
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,960
Goodbye now, Hyungnim.

733
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,100
- Be good. Wait. 
- Okay.

734
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,560
Thank you!

735
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,440
Shit...

736
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,590
 For Kwon Yun Jin's new beginning

737
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,030
Looks like you're all better.

738
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,930
I didn't know you'd be here.

739
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,740
I had to come.

740
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,710
I wanted to see the Minister, too.

741
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,150
Everything's good, right?

742
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,070
Let's cut to the chase.

743
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,200
Say it here?

744
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,360
Do you want me to get you a stage or something?

745
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:46,940
The first time I felt certain was at the police station.

746
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,580
You did it, didn't you?

747
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:09,990

748
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,590
Wait just a while.

749
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,410
It won't take long.

750
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:25,430
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

751
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:29,680
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

752
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:37,410
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

753
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,410
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

754
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:45,430
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

755
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:49,250
♫  There is a night like  ♫

756
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,740
♫  a lie hidden within it  ♫

757
01:01:54,740 --> 01:02:02,550
♫  Following a darkened path, I walked aimlessly and just like that  ♫

758
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:10,730
♫  Even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better?  ♫

759
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:15,090
♫  I'm standing at the crossroads  ♫

760
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:18,880
 My Happy Ending

761
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,030
 Isn't what we're planning too dangerous?

762
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,350
 We can't drag them out if we don't do that.

763
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:29,440
 You didn't know Kwon Yun Jin's alibi was false?

764
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,620
 Good morning. Isn't this considered excellent?

765
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,870
 You know what today is, right?

766
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,660
 You'll have to make a decision beforehand

767
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,350
 whether to protect your minister position or your daughter.

768
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,440
 How could you do this to me?

769
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,670
 Whose side is Nam Tae Ju on?

770
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,220
 Baek Seung Gyu. Where did you hide him?

771
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:51,340
 You knew I'd come, but you don't know why I came.

772
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:55,100
♫  There is a night like a lie hidden within it  ♫
