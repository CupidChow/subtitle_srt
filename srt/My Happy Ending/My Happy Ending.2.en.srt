(My Happy Ending)

2
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,879
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,909
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,379
When did you make all this?

5
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,859
Just wait. Breakfast is almost ready.

6
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,420
I feel so bad.

7
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,959
I have to go.

8
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,129
Already? Why?

9
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,299
Sorry. I'll pretend I had it.

10
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,870
Seriously.

11
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,040
Okay.

12
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,109
But give me a call later.

13
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,409
Okay.

14
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,390
(My Happy Ending)

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,259
Honey, are you okay?

16
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,560
Jae Won?

17
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,199
Hello? Doctor?

18
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,840
Hello?

19
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,309
(Episode 2)

20
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,310
It may be temporary.

21
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,349
It's best for her to stay calm after the shocking accident.

22
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,590
She must be in pain due to the fractured rib.

23
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,788
If she moves too much, she might suffer from aftereffects.

24
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,830
She should stay in bed for a while.

25
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,159
Okay.

26
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,729
By the way,

27
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,199
is she really okay?

28
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,629
You don't need to worry.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Thank you.

30
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,110
My goodness.

31
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,120
When you were in the ICU unconscious,

32
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,620
Dad stayed in the hospital too.

33
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,360
He didn't sleep...

34
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,189
nor eat.

35
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,560
What? You should lie down.

36
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,499
I'm thirsty.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,199
Thirsty? Wait.

38
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,550
Here.

39
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,419
The police came by this morning.

40
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Jae Won. Now, tell me.

41
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,029
What happened?

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,199
Who's that?

43
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,740
You know how I feel, right?

44
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,870
You're all I have.

45
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,838
Nothing.

46
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,509
I got drunk and made a mistake.

47
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,180
Don't be ridiculous.

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Yes?

49
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,649
Ms. Seo Jae Won's guardian?

50
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,259
Her doctor wants to see you.

51
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Okay.

52
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,959
I'll be right back.

53
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,329
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

54
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,040
It's ready in the meeting room.

55
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,849
We're trying our best to stop any speculative articles.

56
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,219
(Seo Jae Won)

57
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,319
The police will announce the result of their investigation soon.

58
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,660
There will be no direct effect.

59
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,459
- And the last quarter's sales... - That's good.

60
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,970
I will hear that from Ms. Seo later.

61
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,769
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,279
Wait outside.

63
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,810
- Is everything all... - Go.

64
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,699
Hello.

65
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,910
This is what occupied you day and night?

66
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,338
I can take care of myself.

67
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,250
This isn't why I spent all that money to let you study abroad.

68
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,980
You think it's so great to open an exhibition using your name?

69
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,790
I won this contract with my own ability.

70
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,290
You must be happy...

71
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,060
to be approved by your friend for 20 years.

72
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,110
The place you fell was a remote location that people barely visit,

73
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,449
so no CCTVs were installed.

74
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,860
The person who reported was a man in his 50s.

75
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,269
He testified that he only saw something falling...

76
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,600
and nothing else.

77
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,398
Because it was late at night,

78
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,568
it won't be easy to find any additional witnesses.

79
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,569
What about reporters?

80
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,139
I made it clear that you slipped.

81
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,579
Never allow any speculative articles.

82
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,910
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,910
What was my schedule today?

84
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,889
A meeting on the showroom style for next month,

85
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,289
the finance team's report of sales,

86
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,360
and a meeting on the homepage renewal theme.

87
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,629
For the style meeting,

88
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,329
tell Director Park to attend it.

89
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,230
I'll have the sales report at night in my house.

90
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,899
And I'll have the theme meeting here in an hour.

91
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,139
I'll go back to work tomorrow.

92
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,610
- Tomorrow? - Get ready.

93
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,040
I was told you should stay in the hospital for a few more days.

94
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,980
Says who?

95
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,990
You should stop and come here.

96
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,289
I'm almost done.

97
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,330
Cheers.

98
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,450
- This is so nice. - It's nice.

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Look at her.

100
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,189
- Mommy bear is slim - Mommy bear is slim

101
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,600
If we had met sooner,

102
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,230
we would probably have a child that big, right?

103
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,899
Only if we met...

104
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,070
maybe seven years sooner.

105
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,279
I'm not sure.

106
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,580
Can't you read the room?

107
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,980
Is that all you say?

108
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,179
When will you ever learn to say that it's never too late?

109
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,889
About our marriage. Our child.

110
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,628
I wasn't going to say this, but...

111
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,629
One second.

112
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,558
- Who is it? - It's about work.

113
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,629
Sorry, but let me make a call first.

114
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,929
Are you sure you can go to work?

115
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,470
Yes.

116
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,710
Jae Won, you should take a day off today.

117
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,710
You scared me.

118
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,679
Sorry.

119
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,690
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

120
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,730
How many times do I have to say it?

121
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm fine.

122
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,349
Good morning.

123
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,889
- Hey. - Hi.

124
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,629
She's unbelievable.

125
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,700
I thought she wouldn't be able to come to work for a while.

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,970
Hey, she's known as a workaholic for a reason.

127
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,239
You'll be surprised to see her schedule.

128
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,849
She has no gap from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed.

129
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,008
The rumor says she worked in the bride's room...

130
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,279
on the day of her wedding.

131
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,250
- Is that true? - I saw it myself.

132
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,789
Good morning.

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,249
- Hello. - Hello.

134
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,320
- Good morning. - Hello.

135
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,220
- Hello. - Hello.

136
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,289
Can you give this to CEO Seo Jae Won?

137
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,758
Would you like to meet her before you leave?

138
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,899
Oh, no.

139
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,600
- Thank you. - Bye.

140
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,350
Jae Won.

141
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,620
Do you know how much I was worried about you?

142
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,659
Are you still in pain?

144
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,159
Yes, I am.

145
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,989
What happened?

146
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,129
Didn't you read the articles?

147
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,329
Well, I did...

148
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,330
Just as they say.

149
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,139
Do you have anything to say?

150
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,809
Did you...

151
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:05,649
have a tough time?

152
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,960
It was tough.

153
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,860
Very tough.

154
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,529
- Yes, ma'am? - Bring the document I need to sign.

155
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,539
I'll let you go back to work.

156
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,679
Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

157
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,809
Bye.

158
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,759
- Ma'am. - Yes?

159
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,730
This is from your father.

160
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,830
- My father? - Yes.

161
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,500
He left it at the security desk early this morning.

162
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Thanks.

163
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,819
She was taken to an emergency room three times...

164
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,049
after poisoning herself with pesticide.

165
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,759
And Mr. Seo accompanied her every time.

166
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,758
She drank it to kill herself or someone poisoned her.

167
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,100
It can't be a mistake, all three times.

168
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,169
The odds are slim. Isn't it?

169
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,909
(Dad)

170
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,450
Yes, did you get the soup?

171
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,919
Yes.

172
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,750
It's the ox broth.

173
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,090
I heard it keeps your bones healthy.

174
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,429
I bought beef bones, feet, and knee cartilage...

175
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,658
and boiled them all night long.

176
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,099
Why did you go through that hassle? I can just buy it.

177
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,669
Goodness. Nothing is better than homemade.

178
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,139
Make sure not to skip it.

179
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,240
That's all I can do for you, Jae Won.

180
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,210
When did you come by at work?

181
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,879
I visited early, so I wouldn't bother your work.

182
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,419
Don't mind me.

183
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,159
- Dad. - Yes?

184
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,059
Thank you.

185
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,330
Tell me anytime if you want more.

186
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,429
You must be busy. I'll let you go. Have a good day.

187
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,750
This is Seo Jae Won.

188
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,490
Do you have time to meet today?

189
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,190
I'll tell you the details in person.

190
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,330
I'll see you there.

191
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Stay there.

192
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,170
I'll talk here.

193
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,269
How do you feel?

194
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,410
Still hanging in there?

195
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,079
I'm not sure what kind of misunderstanding you have about me,

196
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,349
but think about it again.

197
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,720
Or give me a chance to explain myself.

198
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,359
Why do I have to do that?

199
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,329
Because we've spent a considerable amount of time together.

200
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,299
I don't need your explanation.

201
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,069
Then?

202
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,940
Wait.

203
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,309
Until I make a decision.

204
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,910
How are you going to judge me?

205
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,880
How much do you know about me?

206
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,170
Well...

207
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,369
That was unexpected.

208
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:26,980
Although I gave you my business card,

209
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,680
I never expected you to give me a call first.

210
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,480
I have an offer.

211
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:33,980
That's even more unexpected.

212
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,319
- What is that? - Before that,

213
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,990
I need to confirm something about you.

214
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,500
When you're a CEO of a decent company,

215
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,700
you don't only make a lot of money,

216
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:50,000
but you also get connections in many different areas.

217
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,500
So I looked you up.

218
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,279
Why are you poking around what's already been done in the past?

219
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,640
That is...

220
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:02,650
Well...

221
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,579
I'm curious about what you found.

222
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,849
That you were a detective from a violent crime unit.

223
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,758
You resigned on your own...

224
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,390
while getting investigated for bribery.

225
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,699
Soon, by coincidence, you were acquitted.

226
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,400
I can never hide anything from you.

227
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,700
Then how come you were so ignorant about your family?

228
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,710
I'm going to look into that now.

229
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,940
And find every single detail.

230
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,049
What's your offer?

231
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,680
Keep doing what you've been doing.

232
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,250
Investigate how my mom died.

233
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,890
Not for the insurance, but for me.

234
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,190
What's the reason?

235
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,758
You didn't quit your job...

236
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,900
to become a salaryman.

237
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,299
Are you happy with your pay now?

238
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,170
If not, I can cover it for you.

239
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,769
Enough to make you happy.

240
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,129
(Yein Arts Scholarship Foundation supports your bright future...)

241
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,160
(for your dreams.)

242
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,609
Welcome back, ma'am.

243
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,119
Where's A Rin?

244
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,049
She has a fever. She took medicine and went to bed early.

245
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,289
And Professor Heo left for a moment.

246
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
- She has a fever? - Yes.

247
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,950
When did you get home?

248
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,250
Just now.

249
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,950
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

250
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,619
Are you not busy today?

251
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,730
No, not anymore.

252
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Yes?

253
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,130
Then let's sleep together.

254
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,970
Do you want to sleep together, princess?

255
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,940
Okay.

256
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,689
Yes, Ms. Seo.

257
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,319
Is Ms. Kwon working?

258
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,519
Just a moment, please.

259
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,059
Yes, she's working. Would you like to talk to her?

260
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,599
No, it's fine.

261
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,910
You came early.

262
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:54,910
Where did you go?

263
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,650
I went to exercise.

264
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:00,848
Gosh.

265
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,849
My body felt heavy after taking a rest for a few days.

266
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,490
I guess so.

267
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,490
Oh, right. How do you feel?

268
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,759
What about the medicine? Did you take it?

269
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,700
You should rest more. I was worried.

270
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,599
You're worried about me?

271
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,569
Of course, I'm worried.

272
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,079
Let me take a shower first.

273
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,779
Are you really worried about me?

274
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,750
What?

275
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,619
Why did you do that to me then?

276
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,890
Mr. Heo Soon Young isn't a member of our gym.

277
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,359
He hasn't renewed his membership for about three months.

278
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,559
That day...

279
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,670
I did go to exercise.

280
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,740
Oh, right.

281
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,509
I joined another gym. It's upstairs in the same building.

282
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,740
It turned out that it was run by my friend in high school.

283
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,950
What about the text?

284
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,779
I'm almost there.

285
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
The text?

286
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,359
It was from my friend.

287
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,220
We were supposed to exercise together.

288
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:18,230
Because I'm not used...

289
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,900
to the watch yet.

290
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,599
I removed the text by mistake.

291
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,099
I'm sorry for making you misunderstand.

292
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,480
By any chance,

293
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,650
- is your older brother... - My older brother?

294
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,759
Why do you bring him up out of nowhere?

295
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
No.

296
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,430
Never mind.

297
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,700
- Forget it. - Jae Won.

298
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,869
Jae Won.

299
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,069
I'm really sorry.

300
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,710
I was too indifferent. I didn't know what you were thinking.

301
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,809
You must've felt terrible when you were already sick.

302
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,450
I'm sorry.

303
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,619
Please let it slide just once.

304
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,589
I'll do better.

305
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,759
Okay?

306
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,359
It's Mr. Yoon's personnel information you requested.

307
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,089
What about the other thing I talked about?

308
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,459
Mr. Yoon was in a nightclub at night on 15.

309
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Are you sure?

310
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,529
Yes. A few employees saw him.

311
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,970
He was hired four years ago.

312
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,880
He was hired four years ago.

313
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,279
How much do you know about me?

314
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,519
Thanks a lot, darling.

315
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,220
Please let it slide just once. I'll do better.

316
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,650
Why did you do that to me then?

317
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,460
What is it?

318
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,359
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,519
Do you know flower therapy?

320
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,359
Some studies say...

321
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,730
the scent of flowers reduces stress and depression.

322
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,170
Isn't it amazing that its scent can heal you?

323
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,430
Right.

324
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,700
I can't ask you how you have been.

325
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,740
I saw the article.

326
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,509
Can I have a cup of tea?

327
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,880
What about your stalker?

328
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,089
Is it Yoon Teo?

329
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,289
It's not clear yet.

330
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,390
I've been stalked for over seven years.

331
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,400
But it was 4 years ago when Teo came to Korea for the 1st time.

332
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,470
It doesn't make sense...

333
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,569
that he started stalking me in America seven years ago...

334
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,539
when he didn't even know me.

335
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,069
That's true.

336
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,849
What are you going to do now?

337
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,910
Where are you?

338
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm going to be late. Don't wait for me.

339
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,380
The doors are opening.

340
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,000
What are you going to do now?

341
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:26,970
Are you afraid...

342
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,039
of facing the reality?

343
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,109
It's not the first time...

344
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,579
the person you trusted the most...

345
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,490
Why is it me again?

346
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,829
I thought I finally became happy.

347
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,640
Why is it me again?

348
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,380
I'm scared...

349
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,509
that everything might crumble.

350
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,849
(Headaches)

351
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,630
(Ms. Kim, Dereve)

352
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,009
(Missed calls: Ms. Kim, Dereve)

353
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,630
(88 P0505)

354
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,970
(88 P0505)

355
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,940
(88 P0505)

356
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,950
Ms. Seo.

357
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,390
We couldn't reach you,

358
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,220
so Mr. Yoon attended the meeting instead.

359
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,629
He said he wanted to show the officials of Seoul Hotel...

360
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,329
the design of the furniture for the hotel first.

361
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,160
But the design isn't completed yet.

362
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,630
I think he prepared it by himself.

363
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,740
I see. You worked hard.

364
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,569
I didn't do it.

365
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,740
(Furniture example 2)

366
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,950
This car is registered under the design team.

367
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,490
It's used by the employees on the team as far as I know.

368
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,430
Is there any issue?

369
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,900
No. You may go.

370
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,839
How are you going to judge me?

371
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,740
How much do you know about me?

372
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,619
The doors are opening.

373
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,559
The doors are closing.

374
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,400
The doors are opening.

375
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,069
The doors are closing.

376
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,079
Get in.

377
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,950
The doors are closing.

378
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,660
You came to work early.

379
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,289
How did the meeting go?

380
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,799
There is an order when you say something.

381
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,099
I don't think that should be the first thing you say.

382
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,740
Thank you for substituting for me.

383
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,539
Are the misunderstandings about me clear now?

384
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,349
What in the world are you contemplating about?

385
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,789
Is it really not you?

386
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,660
The doors are opening.

387
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,299
The more I think of it, the angrier I get.

388
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,799
Did you suspect me?

389
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:58,410
When there was a commotion in the office because of the stalker,

390
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,640
I went to have fried chicken and beer with Rachael.

391
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,608
Look at the date and the time.

392
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:05,180
I even covered for you when you didn't show up for the presentation.

393
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,420
This is not right.

394
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,219
How can you...

395
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm really sorry.

396
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,730
Do me a favor then.

397
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,598
- What is it? - Cancel the afternoon schedule.

398
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,139
- I have so many things to do today. - Please.

399
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,579
All right.

400
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,590
Come in.

401
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,059
You've never been to my studio, have you?

402
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,769
What's all this?

403
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,050
It seemed I've forgotten about my identity these days,

404
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,150
drawing furniture every day.

405
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,550
You were making canvases.

406
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,260
Are you preparing for an exhibition?

407
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,820
I'm thinking.

408
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,659
Why did you take me here?

409
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,630
Put this on first.

410
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,590
Press it properly, please.

411
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,869
Pull it tight over there.

412
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Is it good now?

413
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,238
No. Just pull the cloth.

414
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,639
Hold the frame tightly so that it doesn't move.

415
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,949
My goodness.

416
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,449
You're complaining when I'm helping you.

417
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,349
I guess it's not your first time, considering how you do it.

418
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,889
I have so much experience.

419
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,089
I made all the canvases for my friends in the same major...

420
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,159
when I was in college.

421
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,659
If you had painted at that time,

422
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,558
you would've become a renowned painter by now.

423
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,300
I doubt it.

424
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,340
I liked painting, but I didn't have a talent for it.

425
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,639
You went to Hanguk University.

426
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,570
You can't say you're not talented.

427
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,579
By the way, why do you make canvases yourself?

428
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,518
Are you doing this on purpose?

429
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,550
You know it well.

430
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,119
Doing simple labor is the best way to get rid of distracting thoughts.

431
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,019
Look. You looked miserable before.

432
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,130
Now, you look more like yourself.

433
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,269
- Want some coffee? - Yes.

434
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,880
Ms. Heo, you've come out.

435
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,389
Mr. Heo, what's the schedule for today?

436
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,189
Today,

437
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,018
you should eat snacks after coming back from kindergarten.

438
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,388
In the afternoon, you should play on a swing with Seo Jun.

439
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:46,000
Gosh, I'm so tired.

440
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,130
If you're tired, should I cancel one of them?

441
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,469
No.

442
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,969
I got the kindergarten bus ready outside. Shall we go?

443
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,469
Shall we?

444
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm working overtime today. Don't wait for me.

445
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,219
Good luck.

446
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,050
I'll get her to the bus.

447
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,089
Ms. Heo, let me open it for you.

448
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,219
Oh, gosh.

449
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,489
You're impatient.

450
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:31,840
(Dad)

451
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,219
Dad.

452
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,079
Oh, Jae Won.

453
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,789
What are you doing here?

454
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,460
I brought side dishes for you.

455
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:25,090
My gosh.

456
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,260
My goodness.

457
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:33,969
How is the medicine?

458
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,469
It makes me sleepy...

459
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,179
and nauseous.

460
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,610
It'll be okay once you get used to it.

461
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,678
Until when should I take medication?

462
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,948
(Psychiatrist Hwang Yong Chul)

463
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,150
Until you're completely recovered.

464
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,050
It's not like a scar that can be healed.

465
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,150
How do you know if I'm recovered or not?

466
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,960
Study hard.

467
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,860
Don't think of causing trouble,

468
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,659
thinking about your parents who are worried about you.

469
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,389
You'll recover then.

Oh, my goodness.

473
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,880
You should've called me beforehand. There must've been no one at home.

474
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,118
I just wanted to bring side dishes without bothering you...

475
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,619
while you were working.

476
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,059
It's okay. I didn't get rained on much.

477
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,030
Just drop me near a subway station.

478
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,299
I'll tell the chauffeur to take you home.

479
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,769
No. It doesn't take long by bus.

480
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,239
Just listen to it. Don't make me worry.

481
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,269
All right.

482
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:44,809
Jae Won.

483
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,139
Are you okay now?

484
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,510

I will face a disciplinary if this gets caught.

487

Your wife...

488
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:19,440
has been pretending to be a patient for over three months,

489
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,380
but I turned a blind eye...

490
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,980
despite the risk of facing disciplinary action.

Let's have dinner together this evening.

494
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,099
I have something to say...

495
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:51,840
and things I want to hear.

00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,019
Ms. Seo, this is the shop-in-shop agreement with J Department Store.

499
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,150
What time is the meeting today?

500
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,460
It's 3pm, Ms. Seo.

501
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:07,859
You should leave now.

502
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,259
You don't have to get the car ready. I'll drive my own car.

503
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
I understand.

504
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,279
Hello, this is Seo Jae Won speaking.

505
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,239
You asked me to get...

506
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,380
Yoon Teo's immigration records, didn't you?

507
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,779
It's sorted out.

508
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,090
You don't have to get it.

509
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,849
I already got it. What do I do?

510
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,288
He was adopted by an American family when he was little...

511
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,400
and came to Korea four years ago as far as I know. Is that correct?

512
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,929
Yes, it is.

513
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,099
But it wasn't 4 years ago when he came to Korea for the 1st time.

514
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,070
The record says he entered Korea seven years ago as well.

515
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:02,380
(Executive Manager Yoon Teo)

516
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,320
I heard you're flying to Korea after this exhibition.

517
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,150
Will it be your first visit?

518
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,389
You could say so.

519
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,130
I haven't been since I was adopted out at eight.

520
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,530
My father died of an illness when I was six,

521
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,230
and my mother died in a car accident when I was seven.

522
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:26,400
Koreans rarely want to adopt an older boy.

523
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,500
So I ended up in the US.

524
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,070
Am I boring you?

525
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,380
People seem to care more about my past than my work.

526
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:49,090
- Hello? - Ms. Seo.

527
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,030
I must leave early today due to personal reasons.

528
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,499
I told your husband long ago,

529
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,130
but I can't reach him.

530
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,739
- Where's A Rin? - She's not home yet.

531
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,409
Professor Heo picks her up from kindergarten at 3pm,

532
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,709
but I'm not sure if he did today.

533
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,840
Okay, you can go.

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,789
Can we delay the meeting for one hour?

538
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,940
Hello.

539
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,659

542

- Ms. Seo. - How are you?

543
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,539
Did my husband pick up A Rin?

544
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:20,239
What? A Rin called in sick today.

545
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,909
You didn't know?

546
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710

00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,309
A Rin.

553
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,159
(My dear husband)

554
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,869
- Hello. - Hello.

555
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
Did you...

556
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,440
see my husband or daughter today?

557
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,380
I saw them on my way to lunch.

558
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,239
- At lunchtime? - Yes.

559
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,349
They went somewhere looking quite happy.

560
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,309
Is something wrong?

561
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,449
Well,

562
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,619
they were with another lady.

563
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,789
I haven't seen her here before,

564
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,960
but she and the professor seemed close.

565
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,280
Hello, Ms. Seo.

566
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,150
Is Ms. Kwon...

567
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,920
there right now?

568
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,449
Just a moment.

569
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,769
No, she's not here.

573

A Rin. Mom's here.

574
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,809
You're in there, aren't you?

575
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,380
Come outside.

576
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,250
Come outside!

577
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:18,119
Open the door.

578
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,960
Honey!

579
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:22,420
Honey!

580
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,510
Get out here!

581
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Honey.

582
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,039
Why couldn't I reach you?

583
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,869
Jae Won.

584
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,348
Why couldn't I reach you?

585
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:20,719
Do you know how worried I was?

586
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,320
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

587
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,090
Exactly.

588
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:29,960
I had dozens of missed calls, but then you didn't pick up.

589
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,230
I thought something bad had happened.

590
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,829
Where were you today?

591
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,599
I went out to get some air.

592
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,139
- What's wrong? - With whom?

593
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:49,409
- Didn't you have urgent business? - With whom?

594
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:59,619
I went with A Rin.

595
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,919
She didn't want to go to kindergarten today.

596
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,059
Just the two of you?

597
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,030
You knew?

598
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,460
It was just us. Who else would join us?

599
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,739
I'm sorry.

600
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,209
You're busy. I was going to tell you when you got home.

601
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,550
Why didn't you call your girlfriend to replace your busy wife?

602
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:28,379
Are you angry because I didn't tell you I let her skip kindergarten?

603
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,150
Do you really not know or are you pretending not to?

604
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,718
- Know what? - Why I'm upset.

605
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:35,860
You really don't know why?

606
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,800
I really don't know. Let's hear it.

607
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:45,599
I'm sorry I let A Rin skip kindergarten in secret,

608
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:46,969
but you're overreacting.

609
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,699
Please! Can't you be honest for once?

610
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:53,239
That look you make as if you don't know a thing.

Hi.

617
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,780
Jae Won. You won't come yet again?

618
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:09,050
I know you're busy, but attend the alumni gatherings.

619
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,590
We're meeting today?

620
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,389
Yoon Jin didn't tell you?

621
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,059
She's there?

622
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,829
Yes. She has been here for a while.

623
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:20,530
Why?

624
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,530
Where are you?

625
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:32,170
Why aren't you drinking?

626
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,138
You should get drunk.

627
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,610
You too.

628
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,809
Jae Won's here.

629
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,510
Hey, the star is here!

630
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,650
- Welcome! - Jae Won.

631
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,289
Seo Jae Won.

632
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:49,019
- Seo Jae Won. - Seo Jae Won.

633
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,730
Can I sit here?

634
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,829
Of course you can.

635
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,670
I didn't tell you because you hadn't been feeling well.

636
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:58,869
How tear-jerkingly sweet.

637
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,400
Will you have a beer?

638
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,610
Hey. She can't drink alcohol yet.

639
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,820
Is something up these days?

640
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,489
How are things with you?

641
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,260
Is everything good?

642
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,659
Are you hiding something from me?

643
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,969
What would I hide from you?

644
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:42,139
I'm always stuck indoors painting.

645
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,079
Hey, why don't you share some gossip?

646
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,449
How did you become so successful?

647
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,559
I never imagined Jae Won would do so well.

648
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,360
When we were in university,

649
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,260
- you... - Hey.

650
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,329
- You're drunk. - Right.

651
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,969
When we were in university, Yoon Jin did much better than me.

652
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,099
Yes. Everyone in the department knew Kwon Yoon Jin.

653
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,469
I really thought Yoon Jin would do well.

654
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:12,939
Okay, fine.

655
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,178
I'm so sorry for not doing well.

656
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:16,408
What?

657
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:19,679
You are successful. You're the only artist now.

658
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,880
It's not easy to stick to art for over 20 years.

659
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,988
You're right.

660
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:25,920
It would've been easier if you had let your dad help.

661
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,820
I respect that you did it on your own.

662
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,090
Hey.

663
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:34,029
How about we be all classy and talk about art?

664
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,900
We never got to catch up.

665
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,369
Forget it. It's boring. Don't do it.

666
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,940
Instead of talking about art,

667
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,739
shall we talk about your breakup?

668
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,649
We never got to talk about that either.

669
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,280
Hey. What are you doing?

670
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,320

671

673
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,800
I read about his engagement recently.

674
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:09,059

675
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,639

676
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,139

677

678
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,110
Do you?

679
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,249
I didn't know...

680
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,820
you kept tabs on my ex-fiance.

681
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,719
You're so very interested in my family too.

682
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:37,460
And my husband.

683
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:50,739

684
