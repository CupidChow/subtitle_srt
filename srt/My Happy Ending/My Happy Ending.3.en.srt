00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Can you die from that after taking pesticide?

185
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,210
Yes, it's possible.

186
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,920
Were you not suspicious, then?

187
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,900
It never made sense that she took it by mistake.

188
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,570
If she took it repeatedly,

189
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,810
she either took it to commit suicide, or someone gave it to her to kill her.

190
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,080
Why did he say it was a mistake both times?

191
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,530
Where should I take you?

192
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,570
Let me take the car. You can go home now.

193
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,420
A group of people who gambled at a fish farm in a secluded part of the city got arrested.

194
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,030
Most of the ones arrested were housewives.

195
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,510
It was a so-called housewives' gambling club.

196
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,330
The police found stacks of cash in the fish farm during the raid.

197
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,880
- Millions were being wagered...
- What on earth...

198
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,290
- Gosh.
- Ten people were arrested at the scene and

199
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:29,750
- to arrest the suspects at the scene, the police took four...
- It's mine. Look at this...

200
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,630
Gosh! My gosh!

201
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,770
My goodness!

202
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,560
It was you, wasn't it?

203
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,740
Don't deny it.

204
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,570
You lie with a straight face, just like your mother.

205
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,510
Why do you come here every day with no money?

206
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,130
Did your mom promise to get you a pretty doll with gambling money?

207
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,940
Are you okay? You must've been scared.

208
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,470
Let's just go.

209
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,790
Where are you going...

210
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,570
Where do you think you're going? You need to pay me for this.

211
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,630
The boys who were there did it. Why are you blaming my daughter?

212
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,760
No, not that.

213
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,940
Did you do that?

214
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,210
I used to do that, too, Yoon Jin.

215
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,540
It happens to everyone. Don't worry.

216
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,790
Jae Won.

217
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,970
Dad.

218
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,670
You came.

219
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,860
If you had told me, I would've picked up your favorite fruits at the market.

220
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,120
- It's okay.
- It won't take long. I'll be right back.

221
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,400
Dad.

222
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,000
Dad, have a seat. I need to talk to you.

223
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Let me just pick it up real quick.

224
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,460
Have a seat.

225
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,780
Someone from an insurance company came by.

226
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,440
Regarding the insurance payment for Mom.

227
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,950
Were you aware of it?

228
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,610
Where's the money? Where did you hide it?

229
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,120
She left home whenever she got money due to her gambling addiction.

230
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,430
Trying to teach her a lesson,

231
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,590
I hid the bank book, jewelry, and everything.

232
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,560
And she threatened to kill herself.

233
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,750
Don't do it!

234
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll drink this and die.

235
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,560
- Do as you'd like, then!
- Give me the money!

236
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,670
I was fooled by her bluffing countless times.

237
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,230
Don't do it!

238
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,300
I told her to do as she'd like. I guess she felt provoked.

239
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,080
She actually drank the pesticide.

240
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,100
Gosh, I was so shocked.

241
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,220
I gave her everything she wanted so she doesn't get hurt.

242
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,830
I got her a loan if she was short, too.

243
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,700
But I guess she thought it worked.

244
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,900
She threatened to die by taking the pesticide whenever she ran out of money.

245
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,400
She drank it again if it didn't work and was taken to the hospital again.

246
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,320
And she threatened me again after surviving.

247
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,950
She did that multiple times.

248
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,490
Why didn't you tell me?

249
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,610
You should've told me.

250
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,320
After you took care of her her whole life?

251
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,920
When your business was finally taking off

252
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,520
and you were finally smiling after being freed from her?

253
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,570
Right around that time, someone told me I could collect insurance money.

254
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,260
I paid off all of her debts with that.

255
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,920
And I got a small apartment with the rest of it.

256
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,450
I thought I shouldn't leech off you later in life.

257
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,460
Did I do the wrong thing?

258
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,070
No.

259
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,750
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

260
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,400
Who told you that you could get insurance money?

261
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,160
Was it Soon Yeong?

262
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,910
How did you know?

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,050
We decided not to tell her since you would've worried.

264
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,830
Does he also know that Mom was sent to the ER after taking pesticide?

265
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,400
Yes.

266
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,750
There's no change.

267
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,780
Administer the analgesic.

268
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,870
- Father.
- Hey.

269
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
The analgesic was injected.

270
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,250
Don't worry so much.

271
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,190
She'll be okay.

272
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,390
There was an intruder that day, and they tried to threaten Ms. Seo?

273
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,930
Why are things so quiet, then? We need to get the police involved immediately.

274
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,410
There's a bit of a situation.

275
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,900
What situation? What if it happens again?

276
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,700
We need to find him before it does.

277
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,110
I want to find him and find out why he did that.

278
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,300
I want to know why he tried to frame me.

279
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,120
What are you talking about now?

280
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,740
By the way, how would you find him?

281
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,800
I thought the CCTVs were undergoing a test.

282
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,490
To be honest...

283
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,510
You mean the culprit was captured on it?

284
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,710
No.

285
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,320
It was recording, but it cut off before the culprit showed up.

286
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,870
I think a part of the file was lost.

287
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,880
I'm sure it can be recovered if it happened while saving.

288
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,010
Let's try running the program.

289
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,510
Doesn't it feel like we're in a crime investigation show or something?

290
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,480
The culprit is...

291
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,980
Where did all the team members go?

292
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,580
Two of them are working offsite. One of them was a no-show.

293
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,630
No-show?

294
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,110
I know. Why did he disappear after the meeting?

295
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,340
- Hello, Team Leader.
- Hello.

296
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
It worked.

297
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,560

298
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,240

299
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,960

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,740
Hello? Hello?

301
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,060
Hello, Ms. Seo.

302
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,600
That's so crazy.

303
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,450
I didn't think she'd come to work for a while.

304
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,000
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

305
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,600
Where's Baek Seung Gyu right now?

306
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,900
Why are you asking me about him?

307
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,280
I know you two are dating.

308
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,970
Do you know where he is or not?

309
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,710
H-How did you know that-

310
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,210
That's not important right now. We need to find him immediately.

311
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,940
It has to do with Ms. Seo.

312
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,640
What does she have to do with Seung Gyu-

313
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,250
What is it?

314
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,230
- Could it be-
- Seriously, what is it?

315
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,770
He said he'd go to Wonju for an emergency.

316
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,860
But Ms. Seo also went to Wonju to meet her father.

What's going on, Ms. Seo?

Are you hurt?

332
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,980
Don't look at it.

333
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,340
They think there's an issue with the brake pad.

334
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,050
It was totally fine a few hours ago.

335
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,320
How about the dashcam?

336
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,990
It was turned off.

337
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,280
Didn't you know?

338
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,770
It's not the car I usually drive.

00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,130
were you planning to see someone today or...

341
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,080
It's nothing. I called a taxi. It will be here soon.

342
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:50,180
He was adopted by a US family as a kid and came to Korea four years ago. Is that right?

343
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,980
That's right.

344
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,070
But it wasn't his first time four years ago.

345
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,230
There's a record of him entering the country seven years ago, too.

Why...

That's enough, I said. Please.

543
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,780
Did you take the medicine today?

544
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,200
That medicine...

545
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,630

What time is it?

549
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,780
It's a little past 10. How are you feeling?

550
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,190
I'm okay.

551
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,850
Since when did you not sleep?

552
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,690
I didn't feel tired even after staying up all night.

553
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,130
So I thought I didn't need to sleep.

554
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,850
Why didn't you take the medicine?

555
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,530
I couldn't really focus.

556
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,480
I didn't want to keep relying on the medicine, either.

557
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,800
I've experienced addiction and side effects, too.

558
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,970
But you can't just skip it.

559
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,360
I said you'd be fine if you kept taking the correct dose on time.

My teacher said we'd have a snack party if we collected 30 compliments stickers.

570

I just need to collect two more.

571
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,880
It's just temporary.

572
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,040

Don't go out with Ah Rin.

Of course. We're fine.

Pardon?

597
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,940
I ran into him while taking a walk here recently.

598
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,230
I thought it was kind of strange.

599
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,940
He's always friendly and says hello first.

600
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,350
We even made eye contact that day, but he walked away as if he didn't know me.

601
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,980
