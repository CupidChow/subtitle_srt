 My Happy Ending

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,140
 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents, and situations in this drama are fictitious.

9
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,090
Who's been calling you?

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,860
It's a friend.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,210
Sang Won.

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,630
He keeps asking me to join him for a drink.

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,680
I'll have to step out for a second.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,470
This late?

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes. I guess he's really drunk.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,750
I'll be right back. He keeps calling me.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,170
Who does he want to see so badly?
  Episode 5

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,620
What?

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,000
Heo Sun Yeong?

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,340
Heo Chi Yeong?

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,600
Or both?

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,970
You'd better stop seeing Kwon Yun Jin.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:42,090

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,150
Why? Why do I have to?

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,900
Why?

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,570
Did you say "why" just now?

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,390
You asked me why? Why are you so arrogant?

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,360
Shouldn't you be apologetic toward me first?

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,740
It's been a while since we've been seeing each other.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Has it been about three months since I've lived with her in the apartment

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,550
I got under your father's name?

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,210
I couldn't see her openly since I became well-known, thanks to my successful wife.

33
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,140
That's why I borrowed the name "Heo Chi Yeong."

34
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,080
That's enough!

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,460
Were you always this cruel?

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,970
Why are you doing this to me?

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,780
Let's get divorced.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,420
You really must be out of your mind.

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,630
I don't want to. I won't get divorced.

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,800
I'll get the paperwork ready as soon as possible.

41
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,520
What did I do wrong?

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,400
All I've done is work to death for my family. Why do this to me?

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,980
For your family?

44
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,840
Goodness...

45
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,430
No. You worked for yourself.

46
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,420
You abandoned your parents and daughter.

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,780
You're where you are because of your family's sacrifice.

48
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,040
You did that for yourself.

49
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,180
So it's all my fault?

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,990
No. I admit what I did.

51
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,690
That's why I want a divorce. I don't need anything else.

52
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,300
How about Ah Rin?

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,880
Can you raise Ah Rin?

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,650
I'll never let you take her.

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,240
Let's not have a lawsuit for Ah Rin's sake.

56
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,090
What's the real reason you're doing this to me?

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,930
Tell me.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,060
Everything you're hiding from me.

59
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,470
- Let's stop.
 - Stop what?

60
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,350
Stop what? Huh?

61
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,730
You really don't get it?

62
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,260
Get what?

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,100
I...

64
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,940
I...

65
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,860
I love...

66
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,240
Shit...

67
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,230
I love another woman, not you.

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,650
I no longer want to be by your side.

69
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,120
That's why. Are you satisfied?

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,310
How could you... How could you do this to me?

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,120
How?

72
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,110
How could you do this?

73
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,920
 My Happy Ending

74
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,320
 Pesticide

75
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,530
 I want to die.

76
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,260
 I want to die.

77
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,320
 I want to die.

78
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,770
 I want to die...

79
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,990
 Pesticide

80
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,250
Any headache or stomachache?

81
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,380
It can happen if the stress is severe.

82
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,870
How about you get tested at the hospital, just in case?

83
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,610
Everything has been revealed. What are you so torn up about?

84
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,830
Do you want to believe it's just a fling?

85
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,640
Not only has he been deceiving you all this time,

86
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,330
he said he loves another woman.

87
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,560
Can you still understand and forgive him?

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,970
You should accept it now.

89
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,090
Your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong is over.

90
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,650
Understanding...

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,550
and forgiving. I've never been interested in that.

92
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,080
Why are you hesitating, then?

93
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,250
Because he's...

94
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,450
Ah Rin's dad.

95
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,200
Honey.

96
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,610
Yes?

97
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm scared.

98
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't worry. I'm by your side.

99
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,080
Let's raise Ah Rin well together.

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,580
Ah Rin. I'm your dad.

101
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,610
Mom is here, too.

102
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,920
She's smiling. Did you see that? Did you see her smiling?

103
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,890
Let's see. Gashi (thorn).

104
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,740
Shiso (seesaw).

105
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,190
Shiso? Somyo (drawing).

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,170
- Myo is a hard one.
 - Myo...

107
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,500
You're going to kindergarten, have snacks,

108
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,590
and you planned to ride swings with Seo Jun in the afternoon.

109
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,810
 He's the one and only father to Ah Rin.

110
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,330
That's why I wanted to protect the marriage.

111
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,900
 I thought I could protect it to the end.

112
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,970
 Law Professor Lee Nam Cheol

113
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,630
  Consensual Divorce Agreement

114
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,440
When did you prepare all this?

115
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,940
I don't think this happened overnight.

116
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,790
It's been a while.

117
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,800
Will you really get divorced?

118
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,050
I can be honest with you, right?

119
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know what you think, but...

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,890
you've actually been benefitting from your wife quite a bit.

121
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,170
- I know.
 - Why, then?

122
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,100
You can't find a piggy bank better than that.

123
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,500
I've been with Jae Won for 20 years, including our dating years.

124
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,010
Seo Jae Won's boyfriend. Seo Jae Won's husband.

125
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,230
I've been called that for 20 years.

126
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,040
It's enough.

127
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll stop benefitting from her.

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,220
So, what kind of help do you need from me?

129
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Alimony? Division of assets?

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,170
Just one thing.

131
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,610
I just need one thing.

132
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,730
Here. This is present for you, Father.

133
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,170
What is it?

134
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,030
You still work on the farm.

135
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,090
I want you to take this so you stay healthy.

136
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,140
Gosh. You shouldn't have bought all this.

137
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,990
Try it.

138
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,350
Hold on a second.

139
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,240
Okay.

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,650
Here.

141
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,090
Done, right?

142
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,120
Thank you. I'll make sure to take it regularly.

143
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,040
Okay.

144
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,780
By the way, did you have time to come here?

145
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,900
I thought you were busy preparing for classes these days.

146
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,990
I wanted to see you and missed Ah Rin a lot, too.

147
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,880
Don't be silly.

148
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,300
I was going to bring her back home soon enough.

149
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,340
By the way, I know I got you a lot of clothes.

150
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,070
You should get rid of your old clothes.

151
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,890
What's the problem? It's still perfectly fine.

152
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,980
Twenty years is a long time to wear a shirt.

153
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,710
You were wearing that when we first met, too.

154
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,870
Do you remember?

155
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,580
Of course. How could I forget?

156
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,100
I was so nervous that day.

157
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,970
I was just happy

158
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,650
because Jae Won chose someone like you.

159
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm always grateful for you, and I'm sorry, Father.

160
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,170
Why are you acting like this today? Is something going on?

161
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,670
I need to get going.

162
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,550
I'll get going, Father.

163
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,880
Don't tell Jae Won I stopped by because she's busy.

164
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,670
Okay.

165
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,560
I'll leave now.

166
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,610
I can finally see the end of my year-long effort.

167
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,250
I need to finish it without feeling attached this time.

168
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,550
She looks lonely and empty.

169
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,320
You realize, once you lose something precious,

170
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,600
how pointless and empty life is.

171
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,490
What now?

172
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,120
Just tell me. You know you can tell me anything.

173
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,160
What's the reason?

174
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Why are you trying to fool everyone by even using a dead person?

175
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
Does Jae Won know, too?

176
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,890
Do you hope she doesn't?

177
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,470
No.

178
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,010
I don't.

179
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,710
I think this is for the better.

180
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,160
I wanted to come clean from the beginning.

181
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,720
But Sun Yeong had a situation. So I went along and pretended like he was Heo Chi Yeong.

182
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,680
They'll be divorced soon.

183
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,650
He said he'd wrap up everything and come to me.

184
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,380
Their marriage was for show, anyway. It's better to end it before they become more miserable.

185
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,760
Seonbae, have you always been like this?

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,240
Why?

187
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,660
Isn't this good for you, too?

188
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm talking about you and Seo Jae Won.

189
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,480
The reason you joined Derêve.

190
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,270
Does Jae Won know, too?

191
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,140
Thank you. Come again.

192
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,380
I'm looking for the one who posted this.

193
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,210
Whoa. You actually came.

194
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,160
Was it really Seo Jae Won?

195
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,570
Yes. It was.

196
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,370
 Are you okay? My gosh! What do I do?

197
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,120
 Gosh, ma'am. The blood.

198
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,570
 Hold on, hold on.

199
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,100
 What do I do? What do I do? Wait...

200
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,160
 Let me get the first aid kit. Just a moment.

201
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,730
In person, she looked so—

202
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,110
Not that. Could you tell me more about her hand injury?

203
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
The thing is,

204
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,330
It was really weird.

205
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,580
 They said they can do it as quietly as possible.

206
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:19,220
If everything you've said is true, it won't be too difficult even if we end up with a lawsuit.

207
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,140
The husband is at fault for divorce, too.

208
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,880
And you contribute significantly more to the combined assets.

209
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,550
We'll provide as much proof as possible.

210
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,970
How about custody?

211
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,150
Is he not willing to negotiate at all?

212
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,600
According to the show, it seems he's mostly in charge of raising the child.

213
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,110
I said he has another woman.

214
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,450
Custody is a bit different.

215
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,850
If one person is closer to the child by putting more effort into parenting,

216
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,710
and if they prove they can provide a better environment for the child,

217
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,770
the liable spouse can end up with the custody, too.

218
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,310
Yes, CEO.

219
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,390
Professor Heo went to school.

220
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,970
CEO.

221
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,940
 First, collect the evidence that he destroyed the family first.

222
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,660
 Figure out his financial situation, too.

223
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,480
 Anything that can be bad for raising the child will be good.

224
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,020
 New e-mail

225
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,710
 New e-mail

226
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,040
 Untitled

227
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
 Attached file: Untitled

228
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,130
 Do you want some water?

229
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,600
 Yes.

230
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,330
 Hold on. I'll get it for you.

231
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,060
Hi, Honey.

232
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,840
Dinner's almost ready.

233
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,070
I really went all out today. I hope you're excited.

234
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,110
I tried changing a few things since I thought it felt drab.

235
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,600
Is it weird?

236
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,830
No, it's not that.

237
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,370
What happened to your face?

238
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,820
It's nothing.

239
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,080
What do you mean?

240
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,910
How did you hurt yourself?

241
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Did Jae Won do it?

242
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Yun Jin.

243
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,160
It's finally over now.

244
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,750
It's all over. Don't worry.

245
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,450
The three of us just need to be together now, right?

246
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,910
 It was a little after 10 pm on the 22nd, as I recall.

247
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,480
 This isn't right.

248
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,160
 I mean...

249
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,370
May 22nd. 10 p.m. Heo Chi Yeong.

250
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,040
Apparently, someone ate all the red bean buns.

251
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,370
I ate them all.

252
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,230
Eat first. Eat.

253
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,950
Detective Yun. Did you figure out who he talked to then?

254
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,440
Yes.

255
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,470
What?

256
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,920
What is it? Is it an unknown number?

257
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,070
No, it was Heo Chi Yeong.

258
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,390
See? I knew it.

259
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,580
But he placed a call right after he got off the phone with Heo Chi Yeong.

260
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,230
Called whom?

261
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,510
- Heo Sun Yeong?
 - What?

262
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,370
Who's this Heo Chi Yeong, then?

263
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,640
You mean Heo Sun Yeong wasn't pretending to be Heo Chi Yeong?

264
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,380
 Professor Heo Sun Yeong

265
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,180
Let's get divorced.

266
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,910
I'll do as you want.

267
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,500
- Do you mean it?
 - Yes.

268
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,220
- You don't want to?
 - I mean...

269
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,200
it's not that, but—

270
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,520
It's all over between us already.

271
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,950
I feel like I'm holding on by myself.

272
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,870
Let's end it before we get hurt more.

273
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,890
It's our last time.

274
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,820
Jae Won. Help me.

275
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,680
Jae Won...

276
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,630
H-Help me.

277
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,450
 Insomnia Medicine

278
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,000
Detective Nam.

279
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,780
Long time no see, Reporter Choi.

280
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,170
I heard you're working at an insurance company after you quit working as a detective.

281
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,170
I almost didn't recognize you.

282
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,110
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,560
What's this about?

284
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,770
I heard you're helping Seo Jae Won these days.

285
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,920
- Chief Oh told me that last time I saw him.
 - Geez...

286
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,800
He's so unbelievable.

287
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,670
Wow. I wasn't so sure at first. Is it true?

288
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,240
You must know how she is lately, then.

289
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,840
What do you want to know?

290
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,010
The thing is...

291
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,300
Are you sure it's her?

292
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,190
Yes, I'm telling you.

293
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,680
Isn't it kind of strange?

294
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,030
She looks a little out of it, too.

295
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,180
Do you know anything, by chance?

296
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,400
- I don't know.
 - Geez.

297
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,950
This would be a big story if only I knew the reason.

298
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,320
- Are you sure it's a big story?
 - Of course.

299
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,400
This is the original file. The original one!

300
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,640
I made sure they deleted the CCTV file so they couldn't give it to someone else.

301
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,710
Really?

302
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,800
Would you be able to check for me?

303
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,480
I'll make sure to compensate you handsomely.

304
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,970
Okay, then.

305
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,120
I met a detective I used to know.

306
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,360
He's a piece of trash who got fired for taking money from suspects.

307
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,350
I'll just keep an eye on him.

308
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,650
He's willing to do anything for money.

309
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes. Okay, then.

310
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,860
Okay, see you later. Bye.

311
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,040
You're right. I do anything for money.

312
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,630
But...

313
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,770
since I've been hanging out with successful kids,

314
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,430
I'm no longer interested in making pocket money.

315
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,050
Mom!

316
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,920
- Grandpa, give me some water.
 - Okay.

317
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,020
Here. Drink up.

318
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,120
Ah Rin.

319
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,810
Mom!

320
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,660
- Did you have fun?
 - Yeah.

321
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,430
Mom.

322
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,840
How many fish did you catch?

323
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,240
- It's a secret.
 - Is it?

324
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,100
Where's Ah Rin?

325
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,800
She's tired. She's fast asleep.

326
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,360
Do you get any sleep?

327
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,610
Of course.

328
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,970
I suddenly came up with an idea last night.

329
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,920
So I made some sketches.

330
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,340
I'm really fine.

331
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,210
How did this happen?

332
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,860
Oh, this? It's nothing.

333
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,620
I made a mistake while working with wood.

334
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,610
Was there traffic on your way here?

335
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,310
Sun Yeong is—

336
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,050
I talked to him on the way here.

337
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,380
I heard he's in the countryside since his friend's father passed.

338
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,210
Oh, did he?

339
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,040
Is everything okay with him these days?

340
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,010
Did he say something to you by chance?

341
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,280
No, no, no.

342
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,930
Just asking.

343
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,170
Jae Won.

344
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,800
By chance...

345
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,940
No.

346
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,270
It's not like that. Really.

347
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,990
Aren't you hungry?

348
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,610
Should we eat something before the meal—

349
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,980
How silly of me.

350
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,140
I forgot to pick up cigarettes.

351
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,410
I'll step out for a second.

352
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,790
It's all my fault.

353
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,830
The rumor has already spread at school.

354
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,870
The parents are complaining a lot.

355
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,510
It's not like my daughter did something wrong.

356
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,420
What's wrong with going to the hospital when you're sick?

357
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,930
I completely understand how you feel, sir.

358
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,540
But why don't you consider getting her transferred?

359
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,240
Do you really think this is my daughter's fault?

360
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,310
I don't think so at all.

361
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,990
My daughter didn't do anything wrong.

362
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,330
The real problem is the people who treat a sick child like a criminal.

363
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,200
Let me try it once, too.

364
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,430
We're just goofing around.

365
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,890
I'll make it quick.

366
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,430
You bastards! What are you doing in there?

367
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,880
Ahjeossi.

368
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,920
I...

369
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,060
don't want to go to the hospital.

370
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,210
You don't...

371
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,250
have to go to the hospital.

372
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,290
Really?

373
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,950
You'll transfer to a different school, too.

374
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,820
Let's change your name and

375
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,960
live someplace where no one knows about it.

376
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,270
If you take the meds regularly, no one will know.

377
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,750
So from now on, we'll keep your illness

378
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,810
a secret between you and me.

379
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,020
You can't tell anyone about it from now on.

380
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,970
You can do that, right?

381
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,180
And Yun Jin, don't worry.

382
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:07,890
I'll make money and make sure to get rid of the wound on your arm.

383
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,380
Let's go.

384
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,440
What will poor Jae Won do?

385
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,510
It's my fault.

386
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,090
Jae Won...

387
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,220
Enjoy.

388
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,870
Did you finish the mural for Derêve?

389
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,700
Not yet.

390
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,090
How long will you cling to that?

391
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,870
I told Director Kim at Won Gallery about you.

392
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,860
Stop by there sometime.

393
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,300
I can take care of myself.

394
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,420
What do you do, exactly?

395
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,560
You've been unknown forever, and you never won any awards.

396
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,810
You must have an exhibition before you can be hired as a full-time professor.

397
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,150
I'll still be a professor at a college outside of Seoul.

398
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,420
Are you even satisfied with that?

399
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,630
What can I do?

400
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,940
It's not like you're capable like Jae Won.

401
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,880
- Father.
 - You've been stubborn for 20 years. It's time to get it together.

402
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,720
You can't keep doing whatever you want.

403
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,380
There's someone I want to marry.

404
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,250
- What?
 - I'll introduce him to you formally soon. Look forward to it.

405
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,410
You'll have a very sweet grandchild, too.

406
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,050
Give it to me, Father. I'll do it.

407
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,390
Gosh, you're making your guest feel uncomfortable. What's with you?

408
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,180
I just want to wash the bowl I used.

409
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,470
Guest? You're hurting my feelings.

410
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,290
Give it to me. I want to do it. Please.

411
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,100
Geez. Okay.

412
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,080
- Father, is there anything you'd like to eat?
 - No.

413
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,400
How about saury (mackerel pike) and soju with dinner later?

414
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,220
Sounds good.

415
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,060
- Saury it is.
 - Okay.

416
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,350
Aigoo, it's Princess Ah Rin.

417
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,630
Are you ready? Wait a moment. I'll drive you soon.

418
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,270
I refuse. I'll go with Grandpa today.

419
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,380
Really?

420
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,210
Go with Grandpa, then.

421
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,650
Heo Ah Rin. Watch out for cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and scooters. You know, right?

422
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,010
I know already. I'm not a baby, okay?

423
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,150
Wow.

424
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,730
- Let's go.
 - See you!

425
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,720
Hey, hold on.

426
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,690
Are you not ready yet?

427
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,710
Are you not done thinking yet?

428
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,350
Don't provoke me.

429
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,540
I'm holding back with all my might.

430
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,460
Just let me raise Ah Rin.

431
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,450
I don't need anything else. I don't want any of your money.

432
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,860
Just let me raise her.

433
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,290
That's not going to happen.

434
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,890
An ant!

435
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,760
The animal has changed.

436
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,890
Push this. Swoosh!

437
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,180
This is...

438
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,000
Team Leader Yun.

439
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,320
- Excuse me.
 - Okay.

440
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,680
Are you here to check things out before the meeting?

441
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,660
 Furniture with minimal design has been popular...

442
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,070
 This design is also...

443
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,230
 Are you okay, CEO?

444
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,890
CEO?

445
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,620
CEO!

446
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,290
What's wrong?

447
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,210
Are you in pain?

448
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,810
No, I'm okay.

449
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,110
I just got startled.

450
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,000
What's wrong, CEO?

451
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,900
- Give me 10 minutes.
 - Pardon?

452
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,700
There's something I want to check.

453
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,760
Wait for me in the car.

454
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,380
What are you doing here?

455
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,720
How about you?

456
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,370
You...

457
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:54,970

458
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,600
I said I don't need anything here.

459
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,670
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,440
Excuse me.

461
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,980
I'm sorry, but could you get me water?

462
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,530
Sure.

463
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,310
Here you go.

464
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,080
Thank you.

465
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,250
CEO Seo.

466
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,080
- Congratulations. 
- Hello, Mr. Kwon.

467
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,980
There are so many reporters outside.

468
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,320
Everyone is excited since this is your first public event.

469
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,770
Yes.

470
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,520
What's wrong? Are you feeling ill?

471
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,720
No, no...

472
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm sorry. I made a mistake earlier.

473
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,490
I guess something fell.

474
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,910
Let's go out. You should say hello before the event.

475
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,660
- Yes.
 - Let's go.

476
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,810
Thank you for earlier.

477
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,170
What did you do with the pills?

478
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,740
I threw them away.

479
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,380
No one saw it. I had them in my pocket.

480
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,940
It's a lot of pills for one dose.

481
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,180
D-Do you know what they are?

482
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,300
Yes.

483
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,130
I've been keeping it a secret from my friends and family all my life.

484
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,510
But I got caught by a stranger today.

485
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,930
It's not a big deal.

486
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,840
It's like a cold that...

487
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,630
anyone can catch, it turns out.

488
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,690
Thank you.

489
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,790
You're the first person who said that to me.

490
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,780
Are you an art student?

491
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,850
How did you know?

492
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,860
It's hard to get rid of the paint smell.

493
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,270
Can you smell the paint?

494
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,150
Only those who majored in painting would notice.

495
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,260
I didn't know you painted.

496
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,260
Oh, I used to. Not anymore.

497
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,130
I doubted I could make a living with it, so I quit early.

498
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,340
That's too much information.

499
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,590
I-It's because I'm a bit nervous. Just disregard it.

500
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,840
Those pills.

501
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,230
I've taken them, too.

502
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:37,450
I went to middle school and high school in the US.

503
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,870
I was bullied a lot since there were no Asians there.

504
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,520
I thought running away meant I lost.

505
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,810
So I endured with all my might.

506
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,340
But I guess my heart couldn't keep up.

507
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,540
So I took medicine and got treated.

508
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,850
I started painting then when I went through therapy.

509
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,190
It's not fair to feel exposed alone.

510
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,760
I need to get going.

511
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,670
Thank you.

512
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,030
I feel a lot better thanks to you.

513
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,480
I'll return the favor if I see you next time.

514
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,440
Next time.

515
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,690
You promised this time.

516
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,900
♫  What would it have been like if we hadn't become like that?  ♫

517
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,250
 Why didn't you tell me?

518
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,580
What could I say to someone who doesn't even remember?

519
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,040
And what would you have said if I told you?

520
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,820
"Did that happen?

521
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,710
But it was nothing."

522
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,900
If you said that,

523
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,550
my memory would've felt insignificant.

524
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,730
Te Oh.

525
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,780
I thought it'd be over if I turned around and forgot.

526
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,120
But it didn't go that way.

527
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,210
I kept wondering how you were

528
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,010
and I wanted to see you one more time.

529
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,250
I'm Derêve's Seo Jae Won.

530
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,740
Nice to meet you, CEO Seo Jae Won.

531
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,500
Theo Harris? Or should I call you by your Korean name, Yun Te Oh?

532
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,180
Umm...

533
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,160
I need to get going.

534
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,700
♫  I wanna know  ♫

535
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,510
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch  ♫

536
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,310
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

537
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,640
♫  I'm not okay. I can't hear your voice  ♫

538
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,220
 Seo Yun Jin

539
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,060
 Could you give me this name tag?  
 Seo Yun Jin

540
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,240
 Why do you want this?

541
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,050
 I feel like I should keep it.

542
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,370
♫  I'm left alone in the dark  ♫

543
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,230
♫  I'm wandering searching the dream for the light which is you  ♫

544
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,080
♫  I'm left alone in the dark  ♫

545
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,870
 Conference...

546
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,780
 That's enough, I said. Please.

547
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,990
 Did you take the medicine today?

548
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,080
 That medicine. You didn't take the headache medicine, did you?

549
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,910
♫  I picture us who are only in my dream  ♫

550
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,610
CEO.

551
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,360
Artist Kwon thinks she can finish the mural this week.

552
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,730
How should I proceed with the unveiling ceremony?

553
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,310
Just one second.

554
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,950
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,310
When you came by last time without knowing Ah Rin was absent,

556
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:24,250
you asked me to call you even if something insignificant happens.

557
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,640
Well, the thing is...

558
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,190
It's okay. Just tell me.

559
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,950
A lady came by

560
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,900
the kindergarten to meet Ah Rin earlier today.

561
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,640
She told us she'll be marrying Ah Rin's father.

562
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,740
She said she came to say hello since

563
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,750
she might be dropping off and picking up Ah Rin from now on.

564
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,660
Does my husband know, too?

565
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,960
 Does he know she came here?

566
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,610
I assume he does.

567
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,070
Ah Rin's old teacher has met her, too.

568
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:20,060
Ah Rin's father apparently asked her to drop off school supplies.

569
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,310
 Even if our marriage ended,

570
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,660
 I hoped to be a good mother to Ah Rin.

571
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,470
 If I can't even do that,

572
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,210
 I no longer...

573
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:10,780
Mr. Nam Tae Ju. Where are you right now?

574
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,550
Are you sure you won't regret this?

575
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,130
Mr. Baek Seung Gyu invested in stocks, crypto, and everything.

576
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,900
All of his accounts were overdrawn.

577
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,620
He had a student loan, and he had a lot of debt, too.

578
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,530
But he lost a lot in investment, too.

579
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,590
Why would he want to live?

580
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,240
Do you mean he jumped on his own?

581
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,420
We found no evidence. No evidence.

582
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,540
There was no sign of resistance at the scene,

583
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,050
and he got rid of his belongings before he fell, too.

584
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,820
You know the apartment he lived in? He put it on the market himself.

585
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,440
Did you check the CCTV?

586
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,250
Geez. It didn't record that day.

587
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,350
It didn't record?

588
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,020
It's always like that.

589
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,790
Why did it not record only that day?

590
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,110
I wouldn't know why.

591
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:39,990
Is it because it's an old model? Geez.

592
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,200
How about his phone?

593
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,140
I didn't find much on his phone, either.

594
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,760
You checked everything?

595
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,550
Of course, we did.

596
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,060
- Detective Lee.
 - Yeah?

597
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,050
- Chief wants to see you.
 - Oh, okay.

598
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,030
Take care, then.

599
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,760
Yes. A team leader from the company stopped by.

600
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,670
Yes. He doesn't seem to be accepting it well,

601
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,320
but there's no evidence. What can he do?

602
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,520
 The geezer didn't say much, either?

603
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,080
No. The higher-ups aren't saying anything. I think the case will be closed now.

604
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,310
 Okay. Thank you.

605
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,490
Yes. Take care.

606
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,970
Shit...

607
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,960
Look who we got here.

608
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,610
It's likely to be concluded as a suicide due to financial struggle.

609
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,160
How about the CCTV?

610
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,510
It's been taken care of.

611
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,180
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

612
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,800
Yes, sir.

613
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,260
Can't believe this day finally came.

614
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,460
It feels like I'm dreaming.

615
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,890
You've been through a lot.

616
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,140
Congratulate me with more enthusiasm.

617
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,850
I arranged this get-together, too.

618
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,960
Enthusiastically...

619
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,440
Sincerely and enthusiastically, I congratulate you.

620
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,130
Cheers.

621
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,530
You know what?

622
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:59,130
I sometimes feel anxious even when I'm with you.

623
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,550
Because you don't seem fully focused on me.

624
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,480
It's not like that.

625
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,170
Okay.

626
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,850
Maybe we should move when things get settled.

627
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,610
I think this place is too small for the three of us.

628
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,380
Ah Rin needs a room and—

629
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,490
Yun Jin.

630
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,130
Let's take it slowly. Slowly.

631
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,770
You should focus on the unveiling ceremony today.

632
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,560
You're right.

633
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,000
Tonight is all about me.

634
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,220
Tonight is all about you.

635
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,690
Cheers. Congrats.

636
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:51,000
 Painter Kwon Yun Jin's "Portrait of a Woman" unveiling ceremony

637
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,560
Ms. Kwon.

638
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,330
You made it.

639
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,000
Congratulations.

640
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,370
Congrats, Yun Jin.

641
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,610
Thank you.

642
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,120
This is Seo Jae Won's office I've only heard about.

643
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,290
It's so nice.

644
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,330
It's the weekend. Aren't you going to rest?

645
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,660
Are you here for work?

646
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,670
That's what I'm asking you.

647
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,650
I focus better on weekends.

648
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,180
There are too many people around on weekdays.

649
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,730
But still.

650
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,590
You should go get some fresh air, too.

651
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,800
I was jealous of you.

652
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:12,200
At first, I was jealous of your talent,

653
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,630
but I realized once we got close,

654
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,780
how passionate and devoted you are

655
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,940
for a long time in order to complete one artwork.

656
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,010
So, after that, I became envious of your genuine devotion.

657
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,830
There's nothing to be envious about.

658
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,440
This is all I have.

659
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,310
I have no business skills,

660
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:44,920
kind husband, or pretty daughter like you.

661
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,520
To me,

662
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,910
my work is all I have.

663
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,570
This is my dream.

664
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,200
And this is my child.

665
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,660
How did it go?

666
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,480
No.

667
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,350
I haven't changed my mind.

668
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,620
Please continue as planned.

669
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,530
You're okay, right?

670
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,580
Of course. I feel great.

671
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,930
You decided after enough consideration, right?

672
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,500
What do you mean by that?

673
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,800
I can't understand how you feel entirely,

674
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,190
but I know what Derêve means to Seo Jae Won.

675
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,640
Don't worry.

676
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,840
Everything will be fine.

677
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,290
I'll get going now.

678
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,610
 Before we start the ceremony, let's bring the star of the night,

679
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,590
 Painter Kwon Yun Jin, to the stage

680
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,400
and hear her thoughts.

681
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,910
Please welcome her with a round of applause.

682
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,280
Ms. Kwon, please come forward.

683
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,980
Thank you for coming.

684
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,660
While working for over 20 years,

685
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:45,110
I don't think I rested even for a moment.

686
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:49,210
While I've held my brushes with agony and anxiety,

687
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,420
you've shown me a lot of support.

688
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,960
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank so many of you.

689
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,180
Thank you.

690
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,060
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

691
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:07,100
Her speech was as exceptional as her beauty. Thank you.

692
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:12,510
We'll unveil Painter Kwon's "Portrait of a Woman" now.

693
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,410
Let's count down loudly together.

694
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,160
 Three, two, one!

695
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,200
That's so great.

696
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,260
Wow, Kwon Yun Jin still got it.

697
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,540
Wow...

698
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,100
Yes. Let's hear from CEO Seo,

699
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,870
who made time to join us amid her busy schedule.

700
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,300
May I say something, too?

701
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,480
- Yes.
 - Of course.

702
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,250
For willingly agreeing to do this

703
00:58:55,310 --> 00:59:00,080
and for creating such a great piece,

704
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,710
I want to thank Ms. Kwon Yun Jin.

705
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,830
You all know.

706
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,220
That Yun Jin definitely knows how to paint.

707
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,670
- You're right.
 - We know. We know.

708
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,060
She gave me an amazing gift.

709
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,770
I also prepared something to return the favor.

710
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,560
This is for the mural.

711
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,680
Take it.

712
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,020
You should get paid for your work.

713
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,640
Seo Jae Won.

714
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,350
Is it not enough?

715
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,560
Will you really be like this?

716
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,940
Since you got paid,

717
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,610
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

718
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,850
I was curious whenever I saw this mural.

719
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,570
Did you say you wanted to paint a woman

720
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,190
who paves her path without following the dated norms?

721
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,080
But why does the woman in the painting...

722
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,390
look so purposeless, as if she's completely hollow?

723
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,480
She believed she had everything,

724
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,320
but maybe she was just a pretty shell.

725
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,580
I decided not to be manipulated and deceived anymore.

726
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:51,440
So, I'm thinking of changing this mural a bit, too.

727
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,710
According to my taste.

728
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,620
What are you doing?

729
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,290
Hey, Seo Jae Won.

730
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,240
Let go. Let go!

731
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,550
Hey. Seo Jae Won!

732
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:08,820
Let go!

733
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,830
Don't do it. Don't do it.

734
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,880
Let go. Let go!

735
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,920
How could she...

736
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,130
Wow.

737
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,380
Geez. What is she, Banksy?

738
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:09,960

739
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,840
Mr. Heo Sun Yeong.

740
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,100
Who are you?

741
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,960
I'm with the police.

742
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,790
We're investigating the leak of Derêve's design.

743
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,640
Their design was leaked?

744
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,740
Yes. I received a report.

745
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,080
Excuse me.

746
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,870
 My Love

747
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,470
Hey.

748
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,090
No need to be shocked.

749
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:48,310
This is nothing, considering what you two have done.

750
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,170
This is just the beginning.

751
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,720
Watch what happens when you mess with my daughter.

752
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,150
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

753
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,360
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

754
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:19,130
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

755
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:23,040
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

756
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,110
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

757
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,950
♫  There is a night like a lie  ♫

758
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:36,520
♫   hidden within it.  ♫

759
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:44,330
♫  Following a darkened path I aimlessly walked  ♫

760
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:51,130
♫  Even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better?  ♫

761
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,200
♫  I'm standing at the crossroads   ♫

762
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,430
♫  where my future fate was determined  ♫

763
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:06,390
♫  and painstakingly inscribed in white ashes  ♫

764
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,920
 My Happy Ending

765
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,320
 Prepare a lawsuit if you don't want to leave empty-handed.

766
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,530
 I was certain I should end this marriage.

767
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,900
 Is there something you should tell me about Jae Won?

768
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,300
 If a spouse kept a serious illness like a mental condition a secret,

769
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,940
 it could be a reason for a divorce.

770
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,370
 Are you looking for something?

771
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,200
 You didn't have to come all the way here.

772
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,620
 Being too careful never hurts.

773
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,650
 When was the last time you saw Baek Seung Gyu?

774
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,490
 When he came to ask me to hold onto his stuff. That was the last time.

775
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,140
 What are you thinking about?

776
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,930
 - Pardon?
 - Why are you blushing?

777
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,590
 No. I don't want to eat!

778
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,780
 Who said you can act out like this? Huh?

779
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,430
 I hate you, Mom.

780
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,440
 Why is it so hard to reach you?

781
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,360
 Mom?
