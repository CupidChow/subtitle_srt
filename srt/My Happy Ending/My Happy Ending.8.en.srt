00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,270
I'm worried he'd come up with a strange story.

185
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,540
Don't worry. I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

186
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,720
How did things go at the expo?

187
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,720
And did the contract with the buyer go well?

188
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,930
We haven't seen each other in four days.

189
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,550
You won't even thank me or ask me how I am,

190
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,820
but discuss work right away?

191
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,670
Your face tells me you're fine.

192
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,500
How does my face look?

193
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,390
It looks ugly.

194
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,920
Geez.

195
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,360
You definitely said I was handsome when you came to scout me.

196
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,440
- I could say anything when I'm trying to pursue someone.
- Geez...

197
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,360
I can't be laughing right now.

198
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,670
But I can't help it.

199
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,600
It's been a while since I've seen you like this.

200
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,220
I don't get what you're saying.

201
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,380
What has been a while?

202
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,000
Never mind.

203
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,250
Just one second.

204
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,110
Hi, Dad.

205
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,160
You're near the office?

206
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,610
What brings you here without notice? Yeah...

207
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,670
Dad.

208
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey.

209
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,100
Your office is nice and spacious.

210
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,380
Is this your first time?

211
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,100
I should've shown you around sooner.

212
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,110
It's okay. It'd just be distracting you.

213
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,860
Did I make you come back when you were busy?

214
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,530
Not at all. Have you eaten?

215
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,960
Let's go out if you haven't.

216
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,470
I already ate.

217
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,700
I came to Seoul to run an errand,

218
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,200
and I wanted to see you briefly before I leave.

219
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,750
Why don't you sit down for some tea-

220
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,110
No, it's okay.

221
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,420
Hey. It feels like you're higher up than it seems outside.

222
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,760
The ground seems so far away.

223
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,370
My daughter.

224
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,920
You must've been through a lot to get here.

225
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,040
I did it because I wanted to.

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,600
Yes.

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,270
I thought this was how it should be.

228
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,850
Doing what you really like,

229
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,230
meeting a nice person, and starting a family.

230
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,330
I thought achieving your dream one by one

231
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,580
would make you happy.

232
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,980
I thought you'd forget everything without dwelling on the past.

233
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,560
Dad, I'm happy.

234
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,120
I mean it.

235
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,060
Jae Won.

236
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,940
No, no, no, no, no.

237
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,480
No, no.

238
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,190
No.

239
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,700
I came to learn about this medicine.

240
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,640
I looked it up, and they say it's used to treat bipolar disorder.

241
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,160
Do you take this yourself?

242
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,740
No, my wife does.

243
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,880
I see.

244
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,240
I can't tell you unless you take it yourself.
[Sagye Neuropsychiatry]

245
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
Doctor.

246
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,900
Well, I thought that was just her personality at first.

247
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,390
I'm sure she was stressed because the work was demanding.

248
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,940
And I thought it was natural because of that.

249
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,930
But I don't think it is.

250
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,920
She showed up as a completely different person.

251
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,260
As if she doesn't remember anything.

252
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:50,170
I can't help her unless she's here herself.

253
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,030
Make sure to come back with your wife.

254
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,690
Doctor, I think she's been taking this for a while now.

255
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,590
I've seen her taking it for over a decade.

256
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,000
She doesn't express it when she's struggling or experiencing pain.

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,670
But I'm her spouse, Doctor.

258
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,750
I could know about it, right?

259
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,530
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,570
Okay, then.

261
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,500
Her condition...

262
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,120
might be worsening now.

263
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,130
She might need to be hospitalized and go through intense treatment.

264
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,700
Geez. Look at this mess. Look at it.

265
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,230
Where's Ah Rin?

266
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,760
She's not done with kindergarten yet.

267
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
She'll probably get off around two.

268
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,270
What? Didn't you pick her up?

269
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,520
It's past seven right now.

270
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,310
What are you talking about?

271
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,470
Where did the time go?

272
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,610
And when did I get so many calls?

273
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,610
You're driving me crazy.

274
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,210
How could you be so out of it?

275
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,990
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,620
You're a workaholic.

277
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,420
What? Don't you have an appetite?

278
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,340
It's too crowded here. I feel a bit suffocated.

279
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,690
You've been wanting to come here. It was hard to get a reservation.

280
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,070
You're acting so weird.

281
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,030
Seriously, why are you doing this?

282
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,440
What are you thinking about, exactly?

283
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,760
How long do I have to tolerate your mood swings?

284
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,090
I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

285
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,520
I really want you to learn what it's like to live in hell.

286
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,760
You cut your wrist with a knife?

287
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,490
The kids won't stop bullying and mocking me.

288
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,610
They say I'm a lunatic.

289
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,110
She opened her eyes.

290
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,280
Are you okay?

291
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,930
Yun Jin.

292
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,120
Where am I?

293
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,500
You're at the school clinic.

294
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,290
You passed out.

295
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,160
Did I?

296
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,450
Don't you remember?

297
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,950
What happened to my arm?

298
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,130
Did I get injured?

299
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,100
Don't get up. Keep lying down.

300
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,320
You end up running away again.

301
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,670
You'd better think carefully.

302
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,550
Looking for your daughter's biological father might be bad for you.

303
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,340
I know you can't live without her.

304
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:11,130
To be blunt, your wife cheated and created this mess.

305
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,310
I really didn't know.

306
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,190
I never even imagined it in my dreams.

307
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,930
I never thought she wouldn't be yours...

308
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,670
That's enough.

309
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,910
Sun Yeong, here...

310
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,130
Let go. Let go!

311
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,780
Do you think I'd believe that?

312
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,750
Did you even feel guilty toward me even a little bit?

313
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,280
Nam Cheol.

314
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,700
What?

315
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,740
Would I be able to fix this situation?

316
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,310
What do you mean?

317
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,440
Could I...

318
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,410
be forgiven by Jae Won?

319
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,250
What are you doing? Call everyone right now!

320
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,860
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy.

321
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,880
The one you asked for the number?

322
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,080
The one with a nice figure.

323
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,800
- Ji Eun?
- Yes.

324
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,080
Today's the day, okay?

325
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,890
Hang tight. I'll call her right now.

326
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,360
Tell her I'll get her something really expensive-

327
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,300
Hey! Hey.

328
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,000
Why don't you whisper to each other if you want to be so crude?

329
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,220
- What?
- Do you own this place?

330
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,230
Are you out of your mind?

331
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,040
You're drunk. You're drunk.

332
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm...

333
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,140
so sorry.

334
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm so sorry.

335
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,190
Gosh, are you satisfied now?

336
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,210
Ah Rin, Daddy's home.

337
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,720
Heo Ah Rin.

338
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,470
Jae Won.

339
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,120
Seo Jae Won!

340
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,870
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

341
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,730
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

342
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,940
♫ Happy birthday, dear Dad ♫

343
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,290
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

344
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,670
It's your birthday today.

345
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,650
Blow out the candles, Dad.

346
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,950
Here.

347
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,000
- Mom.
- Yes.

348
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,040
What's wrong with Dad?

349
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,670
Well...

350
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,290
We must've done too good of a job at hiding.

351
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,170
Don't worry. It's nothing. He's just a bit surprised.

352
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,700
I think Ah Rin's really upset.

353
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,620
We prepared a lot for the surprise party.

354
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,420
This is unlike you. What's wrong?

355
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,660
Honey, what's wrong? Did you get hurt? Did something happen?

356
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,930
[Headache]

357
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,360
How long were you going to hide this from me?

358
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,340
- The thing is-
- I'm your husband.

359
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,050
We've been together for 20 years, Jae Won.

360
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,190
Never mind anyone else. You should've at least told me.

361
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,950
I was torn every day.

362
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,170
But I couldn't muster up the courage.

363

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,520
Why are you still doing this?

542
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,290
- What do you mean?
- Why are you still hanging around Jae Won?

543
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,050
I signed an artist contract with Dereve.

544
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,550
Do you think you have the right to do that?

545
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,290
- What?
- Right now, Jae Won...

546
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,990
It doesn't mean it never happened because Jae Won doesn't show it.

547
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,840
It's not that she's not showing it.

548
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,120
She doesn't know, more like.

549
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,840
Because she has no recollection of it. Am I wrong?

550
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,600
I've seen it before.

551
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,110
She turned into a different person overnight because she lost her memory.

552
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,790
What is it that you want?

553
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,060
I don't want anything.

554

I understand you're angry with me

555
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,420
and confused because of Jae Won, too.

556
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,050
So, Sun Yeong,

557
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,090
let's not make any decisions now and take some time off.

558
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,730

559
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,310
No.

560
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,850
It won't go the way you want.

561

563

565

566
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:06,660
It couldn't be helped because

567
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,080

568

570

From now on,

571
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,620
you'd better not do anything to Jae Won.

575
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,560
I guess I'm...

576
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,070
very sensitive these days.

578
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,490
I'm at home.

579
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,060

580
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,860
No, I just wanted to rest a bit.

581
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,390
This is great. I'm near your house after running an errand.

582

583
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,000
You're near my house?

584
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,740
Hello.

585
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,480
Ah Rin's kindergarten is near here.

586
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,060
Oh, really?

587
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,470
I didn't know her kindergarten was so close by.

588
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,280
Yun Jin.

589
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,250
What did you mean when you said that last time?

590
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,880
You said my husband might have a secret he can't share.

591
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,850
Oh, that?

592
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:26,540
I didn't really mean anything.

593
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:32,510
They say even married couples don't always know what each other is thinking.

594
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,310
What? Did you misunderstand what I said?

595
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,150
No, it's not that.

596
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,970
Are you having an issue with Sun Yeong, then?

597
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,480
I saw a weird article.

598
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,260
It said we were getting divorced.

599
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,110
And they mentioned a design being leaked, too.

600
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,530
Was there an article like that?

601
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,480
I think it's a ridiculous rumor, but it kind of bothers me.

602
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,150
It's not unusual for reporters to write whatever they want.

603
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,840
Don't worry so much.

604
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,230
Okay.

605
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,570
She might not accept it as reality even after reading an article.

606
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,940
Rather than accepting a painful truth,

607
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,180
pretending it never happened and ignoring it

608
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,010
might be easier immediately. So she might not remember.

609
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:36,210
To subconsciously protect herself by maintaining false peace on the outside.

610
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:41,130
But a small memory from the past might trigger...

611
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,470
her memories from the past.

612
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,950
But it differs case by case.

613
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,710
Jae Won, do you remember when we were in middle school?

614
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,630
What made you suddenly bring that up?

615
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,750
Just because. Don't you remember?

616
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,780
Of course I do.

617
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,690
You and I always drew together and hung out.

618
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,990
I heard our art teacher still works for the school.

619
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,110
I wonder if they still have the drawings we did.

620
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,220
We graduated a long time ago.

621
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,850
But still. You never know.

622
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,160
Should we go look for them?

623
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,740
No.

624
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,400
Ah Rin will be done with kindergarten soon. Sun Yeong will be worried, too.

625
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,770
The old drawings might give us new ideas.

626
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,510
And it'd lift up your mood, too.

627
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,570

628
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,480

638
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,950
Only his information was missing from the list.

639
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,320

Thank you.

723
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,410
Why do you look so sad?

724
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,630
Is it because of the article you mentioned?

725
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,690
I'm not so sure.

726
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:30,560
It feels like something's stuck in my chest, but I'm not sure what...

727
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,820
I told you not to worry so much.

728
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,060
It's because you're too successful.

729
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,840
You should've become less famous, then.

730
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,140
Time goes by so fast.

731
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,280
We never imagined it when we were in middle school.

732
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,270
That you and I would end up so differently, like now.

733
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,660
Everything is different from then now.

734
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,380
Your name and the situation changed, too.

735
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,930
The situation might've changed,

736
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,330
but I still feel the same.

737
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,100
It felt awkward to give and take when we were young,

738
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,150
but it's different now.

739
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,330
I'll give back as much as I received from you.

740
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,400
I have already received a lot. More than I can handle.

741
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,890
It's still not enough.

742
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,640
Until everyone acknowledges your talent,

743
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,350
I'll help you a lot more.

744
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,840
I used to...

745
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,920
dream that once.

746
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,460
Why is it in the past tense? It's just getting started.

747
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,660
Because my dream changed.

748
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,590
Really?

749
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,720
What is it?

750
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,910
Don't ask.

751
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:09,370
Why do you care what an unknown artist dreams of?

752
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,120
Seo Jae Won.

753
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,990
Becoming Seo Jae Won.

754
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,330
You have everything.

755
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,760
What I don't have,

756
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,070
the things I've wanted,

757
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,240
and everything I used to have, too.

758
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,240
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

759
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,560
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

760
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,790
♫ Could I know the hidden... ♫

761
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,180
You have a father

762
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,290
and a husband who are always...

763
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,830
on your side.

764
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,160
On your and Sun Yeong's wedding day,

765
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,120
you shined so brightly.

766
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,480
♫ Like a lie hidden within it ♫

767
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,990
Seeing you promising to love only each other forever

768
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,330
made me think.

769
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,410
That I also want to...

770
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,960
start a family...

771
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,550
that everyone blesses.

772
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:40,500
♫ I'm standing at the crossroads where my future fate was determined ♫

773
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:47,340
♫ And painstakingly inscribed in white ashes. I'm lost. ♫

774
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:51,260
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

775
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,470
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

776
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:03,250
♫ Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky? ♫

777
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,260
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

778
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,640
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

779
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,070
That I want to be happier than anyone.

780
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,410
I want to be...

781
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,330
happier than anyone in the world.

782
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:27,520
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

783
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,950
♫ Could I know the hidden ending... ♫

784
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,700
Yun Jin.

785
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:39,280
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

786
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,440
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

787
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,580
I talked too much.

788
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,570
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

789
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,880
Well...

790
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,340
♫ I could fly to the moon. ♫

791
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,350
♫ I could fly to the star ♫

792
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:09,250
♫ There is a night like a lie hidden within it ♫

793
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,370
Honey.

794
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,690
What are you doing here?

795
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,280
Well, I-

796
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,920
Professor Heo.

797
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,110
What brings you here?

798
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,320
Well, I came to meet Professor Heo.

799
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,220
I wanted to ask for design advice.

800
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:35,540
I didn't know you two saw each other behind my back.

801
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,160
Well, it just happened, so...

802
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,290
What about Ah Rin?

803
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,280
I asked the nanny to watch her.

804
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,600
This is a crazy coincidence. Why don't we all eat together?

805
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,200
Have a seat, Professor Heo.

806
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,160
You should sit, too, Te Oh.

807
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,380
I still can't get over how strange this is.

808
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,630
How could all of us run into each other here?

809
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,650
As if someone planned it.

810
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:08,160
It's because I made them come here.

811
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,930
I recently recommended this restaurant to Te Oh.

812
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,930
Right?

813
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,140
Yes. You're right.

814
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:27,730
I thought it was meant to be when Te Oh said Dereve scouted him.

815
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:32,640
He was so obsessed with Seo Yun Jin.

816
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,230
You ended up meeting her like this.

817
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,810
Seo Yun Jin?

818
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,910
How do you know my old name?

819
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,690
Well, I've been interested in Dereve before you scouted me.

820
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,040
So I asked Sunbae about you.

821
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,280
And I ended up learning that name, too.

822
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,660
Stop lying.

823
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,760
I know you like her.

824
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,250
Don't you?

825
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,820
Kwon Yun Jin.

826
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,040
You're taking your joke too far.

827
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,390
Did you really not know?

828
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,470
Are you sure you weren't playing ignorant?

829
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,180
Has your heart never really fluttered?

830
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,210
That's enough, Sunbae.

831
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,370
Why are you all like this? It's no fun.

832
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,290
Why don't we try to be honest?

833
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:35,380
How could anyone only love one person their whole life?

834
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,130
Don't you agree, Professor Heo?

835
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,930
Why are you doing this?

836
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,580
You're giving Sun Yeong the wrong impression.

837
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,230
Yun Jin is just feeling sentimental today.

838
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,570
I hope you understand, Honey.

839
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,530
I hope you understand, too, Team Leader Yun.

840
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,950
Okay.

841
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,700
Professor Heo.

842
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,830
I'm not sure if you know,

843
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:12,410
but I've been very jealous of Jae Won for a long time.

844
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:17,110
I want to marry a kind man like you

845
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,870
and have a pretty daughter like Ah Rin, too.

846
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,630
But I noticed something last time.

847
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:30,130
They say daughters usually resemble their dads.

848
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,690
But Ah Rin doesn't seem to resemble you.

849
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,410
Don't you think?

850
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,670
What are you talking about?

851
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,180
Her nose and mouth are exactly like his.

852
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,330
I know.

853
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:53,860
You don't know because you never got a proper look at Ah Rin.

854
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,510
Ah Rin resembles me a lot.

855
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,140
That's not true.

856
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,160
I got a good look.

I knew it.

Why did you do that to that woman?

01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,950
Tell me! Tell me!

880
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,710
I don't think anyone around you would tell you the truth right now.

881
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:48,280
Ms. Seo Jae Won, you're under arrest for the charge of murder.

882
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,070
Are you kneeling in front of me because of Seo Jae Won?

883
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,850
Are you out of your mind?
