11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,030
I think I'm too useless of a person.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,180
That's why I'm trying even harder.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,500
If I become a successful adult someday,

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,380
I want to make sure I'll be helpful to someone then.

I heard you were hospitalized due to auditory and visual hallucinations.

26
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,550
Is that correct?

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,180
Yes, that's correct.
[Episode 15]

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,280
Do you still hallucinate?

29
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,730
Yes.

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,320
Where's your hallucination right now?

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,180
Are they talking to you?

32
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,660
No.

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,460
How am I supposed to believe you?

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,260
You can't tell apart reality and fantasy,

35
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,950
and you're confused right now. Aren't you?

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,170
I learned when she turned 15.

37
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,380
We went to a psychiatrist, although it might've been overdue.

38
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,820
But the rumor spread at school, and I saw her getting bullied.

39
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm sure it wasn't just the kids.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,230
The adults who treated her like a criminal

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,430
because they thought she'd hurt their kids were worse, you could say.

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,250
That's why I suggested we keep it a secret.

43
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,120
Because I knew how hurtful people's criticism could be.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,680
So, I suggested we don't let anyone know.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,700
No...

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,180
you still should've told me.

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,360
At least, you should've told me if Jae Won couldn't.

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,630
Yes.

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,490
It's my fault, Sun Yeong.

50
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,910
It's not like that could've cured her illness.

51
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,280
The more she tried to hide it,

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,340
the more she must've been hurting inside.

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,150
I didn't know that.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,110
It's all my responsibility.

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,900
It's all my fault.

56
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,270
Please answer, Witness.

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,480
Witness!

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,570
I killed her.

59
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,060
I killed her.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Be quiet.

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,950
Please calm down, Defendant.

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,080
Let me make this clear.

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,930
Are you admitting that you committed the crime right now?

64
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,170
It's my fault.

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,180
So, please don't do this to my daughter.

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,880

Your Honor,

68
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,270
it appears the defendant couldn't tolerate how aggressively the prosecution

69
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,780
was questioning his daughter that he made the comment haphazardly.

70
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,660
I hope you understand that.

71
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,950
Defendant, please be careful with your comments.

72
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,910
Prosecution, continue questioning.

73
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,620
Let me ask you one more time.

74
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,710
Aren't you confused, unable to tell reality and hallucination apart?

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm telling them apart accurately.

76
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,390
Just like how I'm understanding your question

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,490
and answering you right now.

78
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,620
Did you know that...

79
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,520
more than 30 percent of Korean people suffer from mental conditions?

80
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,050
You only need to answer my questions.

81
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,100
One out of three people...

82
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,170
can experience...

83
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,080
a mental condition at least once in their lives.

84
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,480
But our society still perceives mental conditions

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,700
as something to fear and loathe.

86
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,310
Shouldn't we change that perception first?

87
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,920
The patients and their families

88
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,370
are already suffering enough,

89
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,520
but it'd be too cruel to force them to endure prejudice, too.

90
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,360
The situation isn't great.

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,780
I explained that Mr. Seo said that haphazardly,

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,010
but I'm sure the judges will remember that.

93
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,640
It might affect the ruling.

94
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,820
So, you mean we need a witness to flip the script, right?

95
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes...

96
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,130
If there's a witness to testify that your mother repeatedly took the pesticide with no intention of dying,

97
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,630
Mr. Seo will likely be acquitted.

98
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,070
Call me with this when you decide.

99
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,280
What's the reason you handed over the video first?

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,550
Because that way, you'd take the negotiation seriously.

101
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,650
I'll be betting this time.

102
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,180
Let's try to save both you and me.

103
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,350
Ms. Seo,

104
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,370
I found someone in contact with Dr. Kim Seong Hun, her doctor at the time.

105
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,850
I'll meet with them tomorrow.

106
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,690
Thank you so much.

107
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,900
We just need to find the witness to testify she took the pesticide to threaten,

108
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,260
but Nam Tae Ju is probably the only one, right?

109
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,970
What do you think he actually wants?

110
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,990
We need to know that to put him in court.

111
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,150
He must've thought he couldn't continue hiding.

112
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,500
He must be planning to catch Kwon Yun Jin and save himself, too.

113
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,030
Why? Are you worried?

114
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,730
Yes, a little, you know.

115
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,130
We might be trusting him too quickly.

116
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,760
We're not trusting him.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,910
We're using his desire to survive.

118
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,340
Because Nam Tae Ju will clear his name if Kwon Yun Jin gets caught.

119
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,820
Yes.

120
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,650
It's my fault.

121
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,740
Please don't do this to my daughter.

122
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,400
I beg you.

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,560
The patients and their families are already suffering enough,

124
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,850
but it'd be too cruel to force them to endure prejudice, too.

125
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,490
Why?

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Why do you blabber your mouth, acting superior?

127
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,860
Seo Jae Won.

128
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,790
Let's take care of Nam Tae Ju.

129
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,550
But we haven't found out what he has-

130
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,650
I changed my mind.

131
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,430
No matter what he has,

132
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,150
we just need to make sure he can't reveal it.

133
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,320
I've been overthinking too much.

134
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,650
I just had to remove him if he got in the way.

135
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,480
Got it.

136
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,050
Before I meet her,

137
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,060
I should get things out of the way first.

138
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,870
Right?

139
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,360
What did you eat?

140
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,230
I ate tomato spaghetti, scrambled eggs, and bacon.

141
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,340
Right, you said you'll be in a musical for the recital, right?

142
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,240
How are the friends you practice with? Did you befriend them?

143
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,740
Of course.

144
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,210
I'm super popular here, too.

145
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,510
I want to see you perform, too.

146
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,760
I'll show you when I go to Korea soon. Just wait until then.

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,260
Okay.

148
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,530
I'll have to start counting the days until you come.

149
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,950
Okay. I'll go take a shower now, Mom.

150
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,500
Okay. Talk to you later.

151
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,440
Okay, bye.

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,160
Don't worry so much.

153
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,400
The next trial will go well.

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,980
Jae Won.

155
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,760
Dad,

156
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,340
do you remember what I said to you when I was 15?

157
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,320
I said I felt useless.

158
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,340
I said once I become successful,

159
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,940
I want to become helpful to someone, you know?

160
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,730
I really...

161
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,530
wanted to help you achieve that dream.

162
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,180
But I always felt bad because I felt like I didn't get to.

163
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,190
I think it's my fault that you got to walk this difficult path.

164
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,850
Instead of hiding it and running away,

165
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,880
I should've told you to live confidently since it's not your fault that you're sick.

166
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,400
But I couldn't do that.

167
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,520
It's all my fault.

168
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,760
You kept your promise.

169
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,270
You made me plenty happy

170
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,970
by just being by my side.

171
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,780
It wasn't an easy favor to do.

172
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,110
So, please stop feeling guilty toward me.

173
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,260
For the remainder of your life,

174
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,040
care for and tend to yourself a lot more.

175
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,810
So, you could be with Ah Rin and me for a long time.

176
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,750
How's your father doing?

177
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,320
He's fine.

178
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,040
That's good to hear.

179
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,080
Right, the doctor will make it to the trial in time since he got on the early flight.

180
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,010
Thanks for helping with that.

181
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,920
- Are you home?
- No, I'm at the studio.

182
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,080
I have things to sort out before going back to work.

183
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,940
- How about you?
- I'm on my way back.

184
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,790
If so, stop by the studio for a moment.

185
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,600
I need to ask you something, too.

186
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,730
Okay, see you there.

187
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,510
You haven't been here in a while, right?

188
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,880
I've been forgetting...

189
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
how great of an artist you were.

190
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,350
You forgot about that?

191
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,170
You came all the way to the US to scout me four years ago.

192
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm a bit disappointed.

193
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,730
I know.

194
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,770
Why did you want me to come here, by the way?

195
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,590
Oh, well...

196
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,450
For the same reason as then.

197
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,690
I wanted to see the Seo Jae Won I know of.

198
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,100
Dereve's CEO, Seo Jae Won.

199
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,140
You took longer than I thought.

200
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,180
So, what did Kwon Yun Jin say?

201
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,790
Are you trying to negotiate or threaten?

202
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,900
Wow, you have a nice knife.

203
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,960
It's not a kitchen knife.

204
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,790
Finished.

205
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,430
[Wonjin District Court]

206
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,110
- You couldn't reach Nam Tae Ju yet, right?
- No.

207
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,220
I can't get a hold of him.

208
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,170
I suppose something isn't going your way.

209
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,380
Don't waste your energy.

210
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,030
December 4th, 2023. Wonjin District Court's Criminal Division No. 8 will

211
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,470
start the afternoon trial.

212
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,080
This is the case of Defendant Seo Chang Seok, 2023GoHab1402.

213
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,150
The prosecution, defense, and defendant. Is everyone present?

214
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

215
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,890
You were Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang's doctor when she was

216
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,290
sent to the ER after taking a pesticide, correct?

217
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,670
Yes, that's correct.

218
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,370
I was present the first three times she came in.

219
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,130
But I was off duty the fourth time she came in.

220
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,960
What condition was she in at the time?

221
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I know she got her stomach pumped,

222
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,010
but she had chronic nephritis and took a pesticide.

223
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,710
Is it common for someone like that to recover enough to get discharged?

224
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,370
- Not to mention, it happened three times.
- It's uncommon.

225
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,560
But that was possible because Ms. Jeong took a diluted pesticide.

226
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,200
- In all three occasions, correct?
- Yes.

227
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,530
So, the defendant wasn't aware Ms. Jeong took a below-lethal dose of

228
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,860
pesticide three times until you told him, correct?

229
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,980
That's how I understood.

230
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,620
He seemed quite shocked.

231
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,390
That's all.

232
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,340
Witness, when the defendant first brought the victim to the ER,

233
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,740
he said she took a pesticide by accident. Is that true?

234
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,030
Yes, it's true.

235
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,670
Instead of telling the truth that she took the pesticide on purpose,

236
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,860
why would he lie that she had taken it by mistake?

237
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,250
He refused an autopsy, and he lied to get prescriptions.

238
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,860
And he lied that she had taken the pesticide by mistake.

239
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,180
How do we know if he isn't lying again?

240
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,940
The defense's next witness, Mr. Nam Tae Ju.

241
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,300
Please come to the witness stand.

242
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,320
Is he not here?

243
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,280
Nam Tae Ju is here.

244
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Yes, we'll start questioning Witness Nam Tae Ju, then.

245
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,700
Your Honor, the witness, Nam Tae Ju, is a murder suspect who's wanted for

246
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,420
killing a man in his 30s recently.

247
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,120
Even if he testified, the credibility of his testimony should be questioned.

248
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,430
Be quiet. Be quiet. Everyone, be quiet.

249
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,030
Witness Nam Tae Ju.

250
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,780
Is it true what the prosecution said?

251
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,610
It is true I'm wanted,

252
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,550
but I didn't kill him.

253
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,740
I came because I'm innocent.

254
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,380
According to Clause 146 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

255
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,730
he can be questioned as a witness even though he's a murder suspect in a separate case.

256
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,660
Witness, take an oath.

257
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,750
Witness's oath.

258
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,220
I swear that I'll state the truth without hiding or adding anything

259
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,670
and if I lie, I'll be punished for committing perjury.

260
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,020
Witness, Nam Tae Ju.

261
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,930
Have a seat, Witness.

262
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,930
The defense may start the questioning.

263
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,160
Witness, you were the insurance inspector for the payout the defendant received.

264
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,340
That's correct.

265
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,200
Who signed up for Ms. Jeong's life insurance plan?

266
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,690
It was Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang.

267
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,190
I see.

268
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,150
How did you know Ms. Jeong?

269
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,660
We used to gamble together.

270
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,450
- You must've talked to her a lot, then.
- Oh, boy...

271
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,900
We talked about all sorts of things.

272
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,020
Regarding taking the pesticide, too?

273
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,990
She kept bringing more money even after she lost.

274
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,580
I asked her where she got the money, and she said her husband gave it to her.

275
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,820
She said she took the pesticide out of anger at first and managed to survive,

276
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,020
but he kept giving her money because he got so scared.

277
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,990
She said, "You won't die for taking a pesticide diluted with water."

278
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,230
That's all.

279
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,450
You have the right to an attorney.

280
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,690
You have the right to remain silent.

281
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,460
You know the rest, right?

282
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,270
Here I go. Bam.

283
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,890
Let's get going.

284
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,410
I'll announce the ruling for 2023GoHab1402, Defendant Seo Chang Seok's case.

285
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,140
Defendant, please stand up.

286
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,410
Defendant, you were charged with murder and insurance fraud.

287
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,820
You insisted that you did not intend to kill.

288
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,670
Murder is often committed by taking a certain action proactively,

289
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:33,750
but when someone's a guarantor, who's required to protect the other person by law,

290
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,490
and was aware they could've saved their life,

291
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,940
but decided not to, it can be considered a murder.

292
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,430
In this case, the defendant was aware the victim suffered from chronic nephritis,

293
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:53,780
but when she took a pesticide, he waited to call 911.

294
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,600
He refused to get an autopsy on her.

295
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,540
And considering he spent the entire 500 million won he received as the life insurance payout,

296
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,660
the defendant, whose duty was to protect the victim as her husband,

297
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,700
can be suspected of intending the murder by being willfully negligent.

298
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,180
However, although he waited a moment to call 911 on the day of the incident,

299
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,600
he tried to save the victim by eventually calling 911.

300
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,110
Considering the long period of time the victim has been hurting her family by gambling,

301
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:40,720
he had cared for his young stepdaughter, who was neglected all alone.

302
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,250
It's convincing that he was angry at the moment and waited briefly

303
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,950
to call 911 since he thought she took the pesticide to threaten him.

304
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:58,160
And it appears he might've thought that she wouldn't die.

305
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,120
In conclusion, the evidence that was submitted to this court

306
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,870
is not enough to prove the defendant's intention to murder.

307
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,780
Therefore, since there is no evidence for the charge of murder,

308
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:18,400
the court concludes that the defendant is not guilty according to Clause 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

309
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,560
However, it is acknowledged that he's guilty of breaching the Insurance Fraud Prevention Law.

310
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,330
Accordingly, the sentence is as follows.

311
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,450
The defendant will be sentenced to one year in prison.

312
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:44,420
However, the sentence will be suspended for three years starting from the sentencing date.

313
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,740
He is not guilty of the murder charge.

314
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,910
Thank you.

315
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,730
What's this?

316
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,470
Did you come yourself to get rid of me completely this time?

317
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,670
You get scared more easily than I thought, Mr. Nam.

318
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,810
Do you think you'd be safer in there?

319
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Who's the one who's scared right now?

320
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,760
Didn't you come because you're worried about what I've got?

321
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,550
I know that's...

322
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,230
the video of Sun Yeong.

323
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,900
You sure are quick.

324
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,000
I didn't trust you, just like how you didn't trust me.

325
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,100
I got paid about one billion less.

326
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,390
Get it ready.

327
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,090
I'll get rid of the video and cover it all up for you.

328
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,400
That's up for discussion after you get released.

329
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,250
Kidnap and murder.

330
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,870
We don't know when you'll get out.

331
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,460
Bye. Bam.

332
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,710
Aunt, come and eat with us.

333
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,780
I need to get going now.

334
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,010
Enjoy your meal.

335
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,570
- I'll leave, Oppa.
- Okay. Say hello to Brother-in-law for me.

336
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,200
- See you, Aunt.
- See you.

337
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,370
Get home safely.

338
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,410
Have a seat.

339
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,030
- Let's eat.
- I told you not to cook for us.

340
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,480
Gosh, I just wanted to have a meal with you.

341
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
Help yourself.

342
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,420
- Thanks for the meal.
- Eat a lot.

343
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,700
Yes, Detective Oh.

344
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,340
Hold on a second. Excuse me.

345
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,550
I'll be on the phone briefly.

346
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,030
Could I pour you a drink?

347
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,680
Yes, of course.

348
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,300
Here.

349
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,010
Thank you.

350
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,480
- Let me pour you one, too.
- Yes, sounds good.

351
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,240
- You've been through a lot.
- Aigoo...

352
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,250

as Kwon Yun Jin, the former CEO of Dereve.

she went recluse and stepped down as the CEO.

Now she's wanted by the police.

700
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,390
And there's a possibility she was an accomplice for the murder of

701

01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,220
Where should I start?

712
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,850
♫ Just like spring that sprung after winter ♫

713
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,260
Work on the details based on the lifestyle.

714
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:34,960
- What are the dimensions of the space for the artwork?
- Of course.

715
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,540
♫ If you cry, I'll make you smile ♫

716
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,890
♫ Look at me one more time ♫

717
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,870
♫ You can just lean on me ♫

718
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:55,290
Did you pick the one you like?

719
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,940
Can I have this headboard...

720
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,460
with those legs?

721
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,580
Of course. You can choose the mattress topper you want, too.

722
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,350
We'll go with this set, then.

723
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,560
Got it.

724
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,700
Looks like the new customizable bed is being received well.

725
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,860
Please keep an eye on the reviews for each option.

726
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,640
I'll reference it for the next new product.

727
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,690
Yes, got it.

728
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:26,170

729

♫ I'll always be waiting for you here ♫

730
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,260
Aren't you overdoing it?

731
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,550
I've been gone for a long time.

732
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,690
I should adjust quickly.

733
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,090
There's a lot to do, too.

734
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,800
Sounds like you're back to the old Seo Jae Won.

735
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,150
What's "the old Seo Jae Won"?

736
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,970
A workaholic who doesn't allow a tiny mistake.

737
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,250
Sounds more like an insult than a compliment.

738
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,960
You read the air fast, too.

739
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,450
You've really come a long way.

740
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,690
I won't work late tonight.

741
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,220
I need to pick up Ah Rin.

742
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,040
I heard she's coming back on her own.

743
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,590
She's already all grown up.

744
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,460
She's so independent, isn't she?

745
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,660
What do you think? Isn't our Ah Rin so pretty?

746
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,960
You could've taken revenge on just me.

747
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,580
Why did you do that to Sun Yeong?

748
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,620
Because you...

749
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,430
took something precious from me first.

750
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,770
I just did the exact same thing.

751
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,190
You were interested in her daughter simply because

752
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,420
she was someone precious to Seo Jae Won.

753
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,260
She was just a trophy you wanted to steal.

Ms. Seo, Ah Rin's arrival time was

763
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,130
mentioned on Rachel's social media. I think this is...

01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,980
I know what you mean. I'm on my way right now.

765
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,480
- Should I come with you?
- No.

766

I'll go check first.

Yes. She's the pretty aunt.
