Seo Jae Won. Seo Jae Won!

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,270
The thing we worried about just happened.

11
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,540
Please follow Ms. Seo and notify the police.

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,120
Okay, got it.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,920
 The Minister is on the move tonight.

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,180
Are you really thinking of jumping in yourself?

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,600
Yes. It has to be me.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,430
Is that why you sent the security guard home, too?

17
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,980
I'm sure they won't notice it.

18
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,700
Don't worry.

19
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,780

 Episode 13

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,770
I get to see you like this again.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,280
As I expected, it was you.

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,980
Kwon Yeong Ik.

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,600
Looks like you decided

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,750
whether it's the minister position or Kwon Yun Jin.

27
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,920
Your eyes are still as venomous as they were 30 years ago.

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,030
The look you had in your eyes when you tried not to show you had nothing.

29
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,960
You're still looking at me like that even when you're tied up and can't do anything.

30
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,790
I sponsored you because I liked that about you.

31
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,440
When your mother lost the college tuition money you saved working a part-time job on gambling,

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,470
and when you had to borrow from loan sharks to make a prototype for Derêve, I was the one

33
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,160
who sponsored you.

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,980
How could you utter those words with your mouth?

35
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,530
Would you believe me if I said Heo Sun Yeong's death was unavoidable?

36
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,300
That was

37
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,500
- an accident— 
 - Shut your mouth!

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,530
Accident?

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Sun Yeong... My husband...

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,330
You know how he died.

41
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,820
You would've done the same if you were in my shoes.

42
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,700
Because everyone

43
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,540
wants to protect what's precious to them.

44
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,530
Cut the nonsense, you son of a bitch.

45
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,650
To cover up what Kwon Yun Jin did,

46
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,420
and for your career, you killed Sun Yeong.

47
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,290
You're a murderer.

48
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,740
You fed...

49
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,880
Sun Yeong pesticide and let him die painfully. You murderer.

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,860
You should've lived properly, then.

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,400
If only your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong hadn't gone awry,

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
Yun Jin wouldn't have been with him.

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,190
If only you hadn't provoked Yun Jin,

54
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,610
she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

55
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,220
the audio file wouldn't have been created, either.

56
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,770
If only you hadn't lost your memory,

57
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,470
Heo Sun Yeong wouldn't have come to Yun Jin and kneeled before her the day he died.

58
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,930
And I wouldn't have had to lay a hand on Heo Sun Yeong either.

59
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,700
You're the one who got him killed.

60
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,240
Flipping out now won't bring him back to life.

61
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,600
Seo Jae Won!

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,410
Seo Jae Won.

63
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
Seo Jae Won!

64
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,300
Seo Jae Won!

65
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,730
Seo Jae Won!

66
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,560
Seo Jae Won!

67
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,800
Seo Jae Won!

68
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,300
Seo Jae Won! Wake up. Wake up, please!

69
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,630
Gosh, please.

70
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,700
Open your eyes, please!

71
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,570
Seo Jae Won!

72
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,010
Seo Jae Won.

73
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,500
The door is open over there.

74
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,870
- Call the ambulance and check inside.
 - Okay.

75
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,110
Block the entrances, too. The entrances.

76
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,930
Open your eyes, please.

77
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,930
Please, please, please... Wake up...

78
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,290
Please...

79
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,550
How did the police know and come so quickly?

80
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,050
That's what I find suspicious.

81
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,470
Did we leave any traces?

82
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,160
We did not.

83
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,190
Got it.

84
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,610
- You can leave.
 - Okay.

85
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,960
Did you go somewhere at this late hour?

86
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,140
What are you doing right now?

87
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,130
Did you just come back in the end without being able to do anything?

88
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,750
What?

89
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,460
Attorney Kim? What are you doing here—

90
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,360
 Will

91
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,010
It doesn't say much.

92
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,040
Since everything I own came from you,

93
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,190
I should naturally inherit all of it.

94
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,360
You've always told me.

95
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,770
That you're useless unless you're in the first place.

96
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,610
You're no longer useful now.

97
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,070
Attorney Kim, what happened?

98
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,680
Attorney Kim, I'm sorry, but could you step out for a while?

100
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,110
- You—
 - You need to accept it.

101
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,660
Otherwise, I'll be in danger.

102
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,440
I know you care about me more than anything.

103
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,600
I know that everything you've done was for my sake.

104
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,040
That's why you hit me,

105
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,780
made me break up with my boyfriend,

106
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,660
and did all the dirty work for me, too.

107
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,220
When did I start realizing that?

108
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,750
Was it from that day seven years ago?

109
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,500
Or was it since Seo Jae Won became your trophy?

110
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,580
If that's not it, either,

111
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,550
it might've been the day you hit me for the first time.

112
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,630
But none of that matters now.

113
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:11,550
What's important is that you love me a lot, Father.

114
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,950
Thank you...

115
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,220
Dad.

116
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,370
Are you awake now?

117
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,740
What happened?

118
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,520
It could've been really terrible if I had gotten there a little later.

119
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,970
What happened to your face?

120
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,180
It's nothing. I just got scratched up.

121
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,750
You're angry.

122
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,510
Yes.

123
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,110
I really thought you were going to die.

124
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,690
I'm sorry, Te Oh.

125
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,550
How about the thing?

126
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,080
Here.

127
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,000
 Only if you hadn't provoked Yun Jin,

128
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,420
 she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

129
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,240
 the audio file wouldn't have been created, either.

130
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,600
 If only you hadn't lost your memory, Heo Sun Yeong wouldn't...

131
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,270
What are you planning to do now?

132
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,240
If we take this to the police or the press,

133
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,180
they'll call it fabricated or a deep fake and downplay it.

134
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,770
It might ruin things for us.

135
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,900
You're right.

136
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,590
This is where Seo Jae Won got kidnapped?

137
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,900
Yes. It was total bedlam last night.

138
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,390
Gosh, those uncreative bastards.

139
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,800
Pardon?

140
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,210
You didn't find anything?

141
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,380
Nothing in particular.

142
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,300
You didn't notice anything weird?

143
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,900
Yun Te Oh was already at the scene before we came.

144
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,540
- Really?
 - Yes.

145
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,220
I don't know how he knew.

146
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,420
It looked like he had a fight with the kidnapper.

147
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,750
Are you sure you can leave?

148
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,440
Yes, I'm okay.

149
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,090
The police haven't found anything yet.

150
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,750
Okay.

151
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,120
Te Oh,

152
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,350
didn't the man you fought with last night

153
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,880
seem familiar?

154
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,040
He's the one who broke into your house.

155
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,760
Right.

156
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,700
I think we need to be careful.

157
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,160
Are you feeling okay?

158
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,150
Yes.

159
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,640
That's a relief.

160
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,930
I need to ask you a few things.

161
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,260
But unfortunately, I don't remember anything. What do I do?

162
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,480
Just tell me whatever you remember.

163
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,210
Let's do this later.

164
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,350
Please come back when her condition stabilizes.

165
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,540
It'd help us catch the culprit if you could tell me how you got kidnapped.

166
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,840
Let's talk some other time.

167
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,010
Okay, then. See you later.

168
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Here's a list of questions and answers for the assembly inspection.

169
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,300
 TN:  The National Assembly of South Korea conducts annual inspections of government agencies.

170
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,180
Did you find the person who leaked the internal file?

171
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm sorry, not yet—

172
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,800
- You can leave.
 - Okay.

173
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,130
Secretary Jeong.

174
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,420
Yes, Minister.

175
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,400
How long have you worked here?

176
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Has it been five years?

177
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,750
Yes, that's correct.

178
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,700
You've been...

179
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,760
doing such a great job.

180
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,090
Well done.

181
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,710
Thank you.

182
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,090
Are you enjoying this life?

183
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,720
What do you work so hard for?

184
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,920
It's what I'm supposed to do.

185
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,440
You have a lot of things to lose now, CEO Kwon.

186
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,610
What brings you here?

187
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,130
Seo Jae Won's kidnapping.

188
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,090
She says she doesn't remember it

189
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,430
and Yun Te Oh showed up before the police.

190
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,860
Something about it is very fishy.

191
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,560
Would Minister Kwon ... be okay?

192
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,440
I don't think you need to worry.

193
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,000
What happened to Baek Seung Gyu?

194
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,340
I hired some people.

195
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,550
I don't think you need to worry.

196
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,680
You think some kids can do the job?

197
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,930
Are you sure you don't need to go to my place?

198
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,480
Why would I go there instead of my house?

199
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,060
What if something like that happens again?

200
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,190
Kwon Yeong Ik kidnapped you. He could do something worse.

201
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,780
But I still need to go.

202
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,590
It's my house.

203
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,100
You seem to have steel in your body instead of blood sometimes.

204
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm glad you think that.

205
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,430
I was actually...

206
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,390
kind of scared.

207
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,270
I thought I expected it and prepared for it,

208
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,490
but it was different when it actually happened.

209
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,970
That's when you showed up.

210
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,950
I just did what I was supposed to do.

211
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,780
But that can't happen again.

212
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll stop it myself.

213
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,700
Thank you.

214
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,200
Detective Oh from earlier. What do you think of her?

215
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,520
Let's think a bit more.

216
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,100
We need to be careful.

217
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,310
Who are these people—

218
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,290
Well, I hired them.

219
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,010
We need to prepare seriously now.

220
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,600
Why did you ask to go to your place, then?

221
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,070
Two-track strategy. Haven't you heard of it?

222
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:30,410
You take two directions simultaneously when you approach an issue.

223
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,240
Go in now.

224
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,700
I have more things to do.

225
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,170
See you.

226
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,520
Here are the files for the Ministry of Culture business activities, private contracts,

227
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,540
and Minister Kwon's Assembly inspection schedule.

228
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Thank you.

229
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,320
The secretaries who enter the minister's office are being watched

230
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,350
because of the corruption report.

231
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,720
I don't think I can help you more. I'm sorry.

232
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,060
What you've given me is already enough.

233
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,730
Did you need to tell me something?

234
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,740
It's nothing. I'll get going now.

235
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,690
When did you learn Ms. Seo was kidnapped?

236
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,770
Was it around 11? It must've been.

237
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,760
We received the report around 11:05.

238
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,750
Then, you must've reported as soon as you learned about the kidnap

239
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,480
through Ms. Kim Seong Hui.

240
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,660
Yes, that's correct.

241
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,180
What made you certain that Ms. Seo was kidnapped?

242
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,610
What I want to know is if the circumstances

243
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:05,110
made you certain she was kidnapped by chance.

244
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,510
I'm not sure about that.

245
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,530
You must not know Mr. Baek Seung Gyu disappeared recently.

246
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:19,200
I know you think Ms. Seo was framed for Mr. Heo's case.

247
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,200
- Is that why you're acting this way?
 - Detective.

248
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,770
How am I supposed to trust you?

249
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,170
The only thing I know about you is your name.

250
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,210
Oh, me?

251
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,800
Born in 1976, the year of the dragon.

252
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,090
I'm the only child, and both of my parents are alive. I'm a good runner.

253
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,090
To become a police officer, I've spent 20 years

254
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,550
desperately without getting married. I'm Yongshin Police Station's

255
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,680
Lieutenant Oh Su Jin.

256
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,310
Ask me anything you want to know.

257
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,490
You know Nam Tae Ju, right?

258
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,050
Yes. He was my classmate.

259
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,560
I know.

260
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,520
Both Detective Lee Jang Hyeon and Nam Tae Ju

261
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,930
are from Yongshin Police Station.

262
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,250
Player, this is your line.

263
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,230
Anchor. Six. The player wins.

264
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,970
Hyeongnim, someone's here to see you.

265
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,110
Tell them I'm busy.

266
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,530
She insisted on seeing you now.

267
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,380
Are you deaf? I'm busy.

268
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,300
She said she'll do a search and seizure if you don't come out now.

269
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,410
Why didn't you come inside?

270
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,260
If I had,

271
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,340
I would have had to arrest everyone in there.

272
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,520
How did you know I was here?

273
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
It's not a secret that you go to casinos.

274
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,220
Hey, by the way, it got bigger.

275
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,390
What do you want?

276
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,010
Seo Jae Won.

277
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,630
Are you here to sound me out?

278
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,250
You'd know if you tracked the places I go to.

279
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,460
I know you have an alibi.

280
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,030
But?

281
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,470
You were...

282
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,220
involved in the Heo Sun Yeong case, too.

283
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,600
Gosh, you gave up on your promotion now. Didn't you?

284
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,570
That's why you're saying nonsense here.

285
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,590
I'm here to warn you.

286
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,640
Don't take it all the way.

287
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,720
All the way?

288
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,860
Are you telling me not to commit murder?

289
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,430
That's why I'm calling you myself.

290
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,010
I was wondering what your schedule was like.

291
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,580
Yes.

292
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,710
I'll see you that day, then.

293
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay.

294
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,990
Is everything okay?

295
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,660
You haven't noticed anyone strange?

296
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,270
Not at all.

297
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,370
Have you eaten?

298
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,250
I ate something simple.

299
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,650
You didn't eat, right?

300
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,840
It looks like you didn't even touch that.

301
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,740
I got you a gourmet sandwich because I knew you didn't eat.

302
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,390
What do you think of Detective Oh since you got to meet her?

303
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,030
I do think she's different than Nam Tae Ju.

304
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,180
But I'm not sure if she's driven by achievements or a sense of justice.

305
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,910
It'd be a disaster if she gets the video from us and sends it to Kwon Yeong Ik.

306
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,940
Have a seat and eat.

307
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,500
According to the National Assembly law, Article 127, Clause 1,

308
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,970
the legislation regarding Assembly inspection and investigation,

309
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,260
we'll start the 2023 Assembly inspection

310
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,410
of the Ministry of Culture.

311
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,710
I heard Minister Kwon influenced

312
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,480
the appointment of the director of the National Opera.

313
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,980
That's not true.

314
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,440
Your daughter is currently

315
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,730
the CEO of the furniture company Derêve, correct?

316
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,050
Are you denying you've been supplying Derêve

317
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,980
with Ministry of Culture business subsidies?

318
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,650
Derêve was chosen through a fair and strict process.

319
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,900
Can you be responsible for what you just said?

320
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,290
Yes.

321
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,250
As chairman, I'll ask Minister Kwon Yeong Ik a few questions.

322
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,420
Minister Kwon, high-ranking public officials

323
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,930
should be completely faultless, correct?

324
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,640
- Correct.
 - Do you

325
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
think you live up to that standard as a minister?

326
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,250
I think I'm doing my best.

327
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,010
Is that so?

328
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:24,040
I heard an unsavory rumor recently.

329
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,210
- Please go on.
 - The rumor says

330
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,000
you're the culprit in the recent Seo Jae Won case.

331
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,650
That's a baseless rumor, Chairman.

332
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,610
You'll have to take responsibility for your comment just now.

333
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,520
Really?

334
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Even if there were a witness to testify to that?

335
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,510
The witness may come out.

336
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,720
Ms. Seo Jae Won, is Minister Kwon the culprit

337
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,240
in the recent kidnapping incident?

338
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,190
He is.

339
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,980
Can you prove it?

340
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,980
There's evidence.

341
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,310
 Projects subsidized by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism which exceed the budgets

342
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,450
 I get to see you like this again.

343
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,540
 I expected it was you.

344
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,150
 Kwon Yeong Ik.

345
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,190
 Are you really thinking of jumping in yourself?

346
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,240
 Yes. It has to be me.

347
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,010
 Would you believe me if I said Heo Sun Yeong's death was unavoidable?

348
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,950
 That was an accident.

349
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,200
 To cover up what Kwon Yun Jin did,

350
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,050
 and for your career, you killed Sun Yeong.

351
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,060
 You're a murderer.

352
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,020
 You should've lived properly, then.

353
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,860
 Only if you hadn't provoked Yun Jin,

354
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,360
 she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

355
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,160
 the audio file wouldn't have been created, either.

356
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,310
 And I wouldn't have had to lay a hand on Heo Sun Yeong either.

357
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,730
This is a setup.

358
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,200
The video was fabricated.

359
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,640
Seo Jae Won is a mental patient who just left a mental institute.

360
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,500
She can't be trusted.

361
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,360
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik.

362
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,570
You're under arrest for kidnapping Seo Jae Won and murdering Heo Sun Yeong.

363
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,310
Please stand up.

364
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,720
You have the right to an attorney.

365
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,410
And you have the right to counter any testimony against you.

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,970
Did you really murder Heo Sun Yeong?

373
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,310
Is the video real?

374
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,540

 Minister Kwon was arrested for murder during the Assembly inspection.

378
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,240
- Did you see this?
 - No way!

379
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,190
 Here's breaking news.

380
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,280
 During the Assembly inspection of the Ministry of Culture this morning,

381
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,150
 Minister Kwon Yeong Ik was proven to be the culprit of the Seo Jae Won kidnapping case.

382
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,860
 Also, the culprit of the murder of Heo Sun Yeong, Seo Jae Won's late husband last August

383
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,140
 turned out to be Minister Kwon Yeong Ik, and the nation is in great shock.

384
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,650
 The police are trying to determine Minister Kwon's motive for murder.

385
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,040
I knew something was strange.

386
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,500
 They are awaiting any further information from the public.

387
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,520
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

388
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,080
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

389
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,320
I don't have to worry about it?

390
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:42,440
♫  There is a night like a lie hidden within it  ♫

391
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,960
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik, are you sure you murdered

392
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,300
Mr. Heo Sun Yeong on your own?

393
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,180
You purchased this pesticide yourself, too?

394
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,440
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik, aren't you going to answer?

395
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,720
Forcing him to answer can be considered coercion.

396
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,560
There's no point in doing this right now.

397
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,400
There's clear evidence.

398
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,340
I did everything. By myself.

399
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,810
- By yourself?
 - Please delete that part.

400
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,860
He said that because he's weak mentally and physically right now.

401
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,600
Weak mentally and physically? Let's say that.

402
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,910
But I can't delete that comment.

403
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,020
Why did you create an alibi for Kwon Yun Jin that day, then?

404
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,660
Are you sure you did it on your own?

405
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,680
Who's the man you were with when you kidnapped Seo Jae Won?

406
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,040
You don't know that person, either?

407
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,720
We acquired the information regarding the audio file.

408
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,440
While trying to cover up Baek Seung Gyu's fall incident,

409
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,910
you ended up murdering Heo Sun Yeong, too.

410
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,240
Because of your daughter, Kwon Yun Jin.

411
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,760
You think remaining silent like this will help, Minister? Do you?

412
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,300
Jae Won, I was just about to—

413
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,460
 Dad, I'm okay.

414
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,680
Don't ever do such a thing again.

415
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,460
I'm sorry.

416
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,730
I didn't want you to find out like this.

417
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,090
Don't ever do that from now on.

418
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,010
I'm sorry, Dad.

419
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,250
It's okay. It's a relief.

420
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,460
It's such a relief.

421
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,850
It must've been so hard.

422
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,740
You had to do this for Sun Yeong.

423
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,990
Wait just a bit longer.

424
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,230
Until everything gets sorted out, okay?

425
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,970
 Okay, I will.

426
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,280
He must've worried a lot.

427
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,970
Don't you think you should visit your father?

428
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,040
Not yet.

429
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,190
Not everything is over yet.

430
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,640
We got security guards for your father.

431
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,600
He'll be okay.

432
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,110
According to Detective Oh, Kwon Yeong Ik insists he did it alone.

433
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,070
Do you think he's trying to take the blame for Seung Gyu's case, too?

434
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,230
I'm not sure.

435
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,380
I don't feel relieved for some reason.

436
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,830
That man could show up any time, too.

437
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,210
I've been thinking about that man.

438
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,910
Maybe he's a Yein Foundation's former scholarship student.

439
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,300
The foundation?

440
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,560
Yes. Including Seung Gyu and Secretary Jeong,

441
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,300
many former students of the Yein Foundation are around.

442
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,300
So I'm wondering if he's one of them.

443
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,060
 Chairman's Office

444
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:59,980

445
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,530
I've always been curious about how it feels

446
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,850
to sit behind this desk.

447
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,980
But now that I'm actually sitting here...

448
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,420
I don't think I need to sit here anymore.

449
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,280
Will Secretary Jeong be okay?

450
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,000
He's okay. Just leave him.

451
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,150
He carried out his duty, too.

452
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,950
Yes. Seo Jae Won keeps prying into our business.

453
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,790
Yes, I know.

454
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,530
- Should I— 
 - No.

455
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,650
It's not the time yet.

456
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,730
We should stay quiet until the police become less active.

457
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,620
Good work, Yun Je.

458
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,050
Thank you.

459
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,550
Don't mention it.

460
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,380
How about Nam Tae Ju...

461
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,170
I'll manage him myself.

462
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,570
Okay.

463
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,070
 Derêve

464
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,720
Countless clients want to end their relationships with us.

465
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,970
How will you resolve this?

466
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,250
You should stay quiet

467
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,830
without showing yourself in public until things quiet down.

468
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,660
How about the reporters outside, then?

469
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,510
Since my father started all this,

470
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,800
I'll take care of things myself.

471
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,740
I'm sorry for causing so much concern for so many people

472
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,390
regarding the recent scandals involving my father.

473
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,120
I won't turn away from it by saying I don't know anything

474
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,050
and it has nothing to do with me.

475
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,100
 It's true that I've been living a comfortable life

476
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,590
 with the money my father earned through corruption.

477
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,800
Damaging the honor and authenticity of the Yein Foundation

478
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,270
earned over the past decades

479
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,690
made me feel very heavy-hearted, too.

480
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,410
So...

481
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,950
I wish to give up everything.

482
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,560
 I'll donate everything, including my father's assets and my entire shares of

483
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,060
 the Yein Foundation to society.

484
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,600
 I'll also assist in the police investigation diligently and...

485
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,520
How interesting, CEO Kwon.

486
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,420
 I'll be punished by the law willingly.

487
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,610
 I'll give everything up to pay for my father's sins

488
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,470
 Derêve's CEO Kwon Yun Jin's announcement

489
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,480
 and start over.

490
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,380
She's responding too quickly.

491
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,800
This also bothers you for some reason, right?

492
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,080
Yes, Team Leader.

493
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,380
I identified Baek Seung Gyu.

494
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,040
I'll request witness protection

495
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,420
and get his testimony as soon as he recovers.

496
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,260
Pardon?

497
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,250
Okay, I'll go to the station right away. Okay.

498
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,640
Here.

499
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,860
That's enough now.

500
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,210
You don't have to take care of me.

501
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,390
I won't leave you, Seung Gyu.

502
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,390
Do you remember our promise when we first met?

503
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,990
We promised not to leave when the other person is struggling.

504
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,090
So, go through rehabilitation diligently.

505
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,300
Let's stand up and resolve your issues together.

506
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,880
I'm sorry.

507
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,490
Thank you for coming all the way here.

508
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,980
I said I'd visit you at your office.

509
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,700
Don't say that.

510
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,030
I should be coming to you.

511
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,860
You're very proactive, just as I expected.

512
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,420
Or maybe something was making you feel impatient.

513
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,310
You were, Detective.

514
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,530
I've been very busy because of the company lately.

515
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,840
Of course, you're busy.

516
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,940
I saw your press conference.

517
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,000
My father unloaded quite a large burden on me.

518
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,180
Let me tell you this now.

519
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,640
I didn't know anything.

520
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,400
That's possible.

521
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,670
You know the audio file on Baek Seung Gyu.

522
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,320
That was...

523
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,330
an accident.

524
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,720
Why did you meet with him that day? On the rooftop, even.

525
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,710
Seung Gyu was our foundation's scholarship student.

526
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,270
Was I not supposed to meet someone I know?

527
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:29,310
We went up there because we wanted to talk quietly.

528
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:34,030
You knew Mr. Baek was Mr. Heo's student, right?

529
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,040
What answer do you want to hear from me?

530
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,610
Will you confine me in here until you hear that answer?

531
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,880
Where were you on the day Heo Sun Yeong was murdered?

532
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,360
I was with my friends.

533
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,860
You must know that can't be your alibi anymore.

534
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,090
That's the only answer I can give you.

535
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,640
Whether that can be the alibi or not

536
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,550
isn't up to me to decide.

537
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,800
How interesting.

538
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,110
You want me to find conclusive evidence?

539
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,890
What if that man was also at Sun Yeong's murder scene?

540
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:39,490
Does he somehow have something to do with Yun Jin?

541
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,940
Not to mention what Kwon Yeong Ik said.

542
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,350
It doesn't feel like it's over, does it?

543
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,260
That's right.

544
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,870
Of course, he knows Kwon Yun Jin.

545
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,650
Yes.

546
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes, of course.

547
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,630
Being acquainted with someone who works for her dad, they looked way too friendly.

548
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,270
Kwon Yun Jin.

549
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,410
All of this was intended by Kwon Yun Jin.

550
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,870
Am I jumping to conclusions?

551
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,850
No. You know Yun Jin better than anyone.

552
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,230
That's true. That's true.

553
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,240
Kwon Yeong Ik is a dad, too.

554
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,280
What if he's taking the blame for everything?

555
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,800
 You would've done the same if you were in my shoes.

556
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,330
 Because everyone

557
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,850
 wants to protect what's precious to them.

558
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,550
She was at the scene.

559
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,070
Kwon Yun Jin.

560
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,650
It's not too late now.

561
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,970
I need to confirm their relationship.

562
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,200
Right?

563
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,120
Right.

564
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,850
Are you okay?

565
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:00,000
♫  Does it matter after all  ♫

566
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:09,100
♫  In the time I out off, I wonder...  ♫

567
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,800
I don't even know when it started.

568
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:19,090
She's always been a friend who comforted me.

569
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:25,690
She won't disappear even after realizing she's not real.

570
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:30,690
I thought I had overcome everything,

571
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,210
but this hasn't changed.

572
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:42,050
♫  Stuck inside my heart with broken parts  ♫

573
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,500
Do you see her now, too?

574
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:51,160
♫  and the bland greeting in the whispered words  ♫

575
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,750
Look at me.

576
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,460
I'll be by your side.

577
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:04,490
♫  It falls to pieces when you come around  ♫

578
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:10,190
♫  Oh why  ♫

579
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,810
Baek Seung Gyu was hiding like a little mouse.

580
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,120
Where's this place?

581
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,110
Let's decide what to do before we make a move.

582
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,170
Decide what?

583
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,750
What will you do with Baek Seung Gyu?

584
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,280
We should take care of him. Once and for all.

585
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,150
It's good to keep things simple,

586
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,020
but you should talk to me in advance going forward.

587
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,410
What do you mean by that?

588
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,300
The press conference and giving away the foundation.

589
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:56,220
How come you get things done without having a word with me?

590
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,040
Your share remains the same.

591
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,300
Don't worry.

592
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,370
That's not your specialty, Mr. Nam.

593
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,580
That's right.

594
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,170
This is my specialty.

595
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,200
I wanted to give you a painting

596
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,650
to celebrate your return.

597
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,330
Where do you want to hang it?

598
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,770
This would be good, right?

599
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,850
I think this is the perfect spot.

600
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,130
What are you trying to do?

601
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,060
The painting.

602
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,160
I'm here to present it to you.

603
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,360
I thought you'd like it.

604
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,070
What do you think?

605
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,510
Isn't our Ah Rin so pretty?

606
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,880
You're really no fun.

607
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,020
"What a surprise. It's so pretty."

608
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,600
I wanted to hear you saying stuff like that.

609
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:45,600
Don't use what happened seven years ago to escape from everything you've done.

610
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,890
Of course...

611
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,840
you're so shameless.

612
00:52:54,740 --> 00:53:00,030
Ever since I saw you and that bastard at the hotel seven years ago,

613
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,070
I've never forgotten it, even for a moment.

614
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,660
I didn't intend for that to happen that day at all.

615
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,600
You know that, too.

616
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,210
Why?

617
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,540
Are you trying to hide behind your lofty illness again?

618
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,440
Or you couldn't help it because you drank too much?

619
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,950
If that wasn't it, either,

620
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,930
was it because of your medicine?

621
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,150
Jae Won,

622
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,580
do you think stuff like that could be an excuse now?

623
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,570
You could easily have told me.

624
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:43,260
You have been the closest person I've had for the past 30 years

625
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,980
and you knew about my pain better than anyone.

626
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,640
You turned away from me.

627
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,580
How about you?

628
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,730
Have you ever even thought about my pain at all?

629
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,820
Have you ever thought about how I must have felt seeing you

630
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,230
after losing my entire world?

631
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,280
You could have taken revenge on just me.

632
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,640
Why did you do that to Sun Yeong?

633
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,710
Because you...

634
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,880
took something precious from me first.

635
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,990
I just did the exact same thing.

636
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,730
Did you think I would be hurt by nonsense like that?

637
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,690
Did you say "lofty illness"?

638
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:43,250
You're the one who actually needs treatment, Kwon Yun Jin.

639
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,360
No, you should be punished.

640
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,350
You're not a patient. You're a criminal.

641
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,160
What?

642
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,270
I'm a criminal?

643
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,240
You were there when Sun Yeong was murdered, too.

644
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,770
Did you lose your mind again?

645
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,980
My father killed him.

646
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,530
You announced that to the entire world.

647
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,910
I know you intended that.

648
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,020
How do you know?

649
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,350
Did you see it yourself?

650
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,830
Or maybe you know since you've done it yourself?

651
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,240
You...

652
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,080
think you won, don't you?

653
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,610
A person died!

654
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,950
A person died, okay?

655
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,610
What's the point of winning or losing?

656
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,490
Don't think what you know...

657
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,940
is everything.

658
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,120
Look forward to it this time, too.

659
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,800
 Yes.

660
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,540
Reporter Choi,

661
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,330
you have what I gave you last time, right?

662
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,400
Yes, of course.

663
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,240
You said you'll decide when.

664
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,570
You remember.

665
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,500
It's been so long.

666
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,890
Just the two of us fishing.

667
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,670
Yes, right.

668
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,540
I can't even remember when the last time was.

669
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,890
Is this the first time since Ah Rin was born?

670
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:37,470
Yes. Sun Yeong's been your fishing buddy since I've been busy.

671
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,130
He wasn't even good at fishing.

672
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,490
It took him forever just to put the bait on the hook.

673
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,930
Once he finally tossed it,

674
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,900
the line got tangled up, too.

675
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,730
He always looked for me, saying, "Father, Father."

676
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,960
That's how Sun Yeong was.

677
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:08,110
He wanted to fish and compete against me so badly.

678
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:20,240
Dad, has anyone visited you lately?

679
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,130
Or have you noticed someone watching you?

680
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:35,840
If I went straight to CEO Seo and told her how her mom died and everything,

681
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,760
what would happen?

682
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,590
Shut your mouth.

683
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,460
How dare you say such nonsense?

684
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,290
Why do you feel so guilty about everything?

685
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,170
I suppose that's why you didn't request an autopsy after she died.

686
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,990
No, no one has.

687
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,400
Who would visit the countryside like this?

688
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,690
Are you sure?

689
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,070
Yes. No one came.

690
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,600
That's a relief, then.

691
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,170
I guess I'm worrying too much.

692
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,980
We'll be protecting Mr. Baek. Don't worry so much.

693
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,070
I'll be in charge instead of Detective Lee Jang Hyeon as well.

694
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,880
Thank you.

695
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:39,500
By the way, do you really think Kwon Yun Jin is behind everything?

696
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,920
We don't know for sure.

697
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,450
But Seung Gyu agreed to testify.

698
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,420
So start from there.

699
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,890
Well, then...

700
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:08,220
Yes, Hyungnim. Detective Oh met with Yun Te Oh at the station.

701
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,790
 I'm almost there.

702
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,990
I'm on my way, too.

703
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,900
See you later.

704
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,380
Okay.

705
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,210
You can't come in here.

706
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,960
I'm Seung Gyu's guardian.

707
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,490
Let him in.

708
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,350
Seung Gyu! Baek Seung Gyu!

709
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,180
- Seung Gyu!
 - You can't go in.

710
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,420
Excuse me, wait...

711
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,450
You can't go in.

712
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,350
- Don't look. 
- What... What's happening?

713
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:23,280
Te Oh! What... What's going on?

714
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,000
- Yun Te Oh!
 - CEO Seo.

715
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,560
Yun Te Oh!

716
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:09,920

717
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:19,180
♫  What would it have been like  ♫

718
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:23,140
♫  if we hadn't become like this?  ♫

719
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,970
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

720
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,940
♫  It's scattered through the empty darkness  ♫

721
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:36,040
♫  I wanna know.  ♫

722
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,740
♫  You blow in.  ♫

723
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:46,130
♫  I wanna know  ♫

724
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:50,100
♫  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  ♫

725
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,870
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

726
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,760
♫  I'm not okay, I can't hear your voice  ♫

727
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,840
♫  I picture us who are only in my dream  ♫

728
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,220
♫  I will cling to it  ♫

729
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:11,150
♫  On the truth, which is harsh, the aborted ending  ♫

730
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:14,950
 My Happy Ending

731
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,940
 We can't sacrifice anymore if Kwon Yun Jin is behind everything.

732
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,280
 How am I supposed to trust you?

733
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,150
 Will you trust me if I give you what you want?

734
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,830
 I'm relieved that you look better than I expected.

735
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,070
 Will you be able to handle it?

736
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,530
 What else can I do?

737
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,510
 Will you spend the rest of your life in prison?

738
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,730
 Think carefully.

739
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:34,830
 You'll need me to catch Kwon Yun Jin and save your father.

740
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,370
 Don't say anything in the trial tomorrow.

741
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:40,300
 CEO Seo's trial won't go the way you want.

742
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,830
 How does it feel to send your father to prison?

743
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:47,340
 Kwon Yun Jin, no secret lasts forever.
