 Episode 4

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
 Just once. Just this once.

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,390
 I'm serious. I'm serious this time.

14
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,670
 I won't get caught this time. Just this once...

15
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,010
- CEO. 
  - One...

16
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,280
- Yes.
  - two,

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,140
 three, four,

18
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,280
- Honey.
 - five...

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,130
 Dad, it's for real this time!

20
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,570
What?

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,310
 Hurry up!

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,960
Hey, Jae Won! Jae Won!

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,410
What's wrong?

24
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,470
Why are you suddenly doing this?

25
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,050
No. Let me drive. Let me drive.

26
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,670
It's dangerous to drive now. Get in.

27
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,840
Yes. Please go and check on Ah Rin first. Right now.

28
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,760
What is it? What's going on?

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,310
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry!

30
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,610
Hey, Jae Won!

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,890
She's sleeping in the room.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Yes.

33
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,870
I came immediately when you called.

34
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,850
It's been about 20 minutes.

35
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,290
By chance, was there someone else? Did you see anyone?

36
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,680
It was just Ah Rin when I came.

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,130
Looked like she fell asleep on the couch after playing.

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,490
- It's your day off today. Thanks for coming.
 - Not at all.

39
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,800
- I think you can leave now.
 - Okay.

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,720
- Thank you.
 - Sure.

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,140
What is it?

42
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,450
Talk to me now.

43
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,410
What's going on?

44
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,970
Jae Won.

45
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,240
Why did you leave her alone?

46
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,740
What?

47
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,090
You're the one who texted me.

48
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,430
You told me to come to the office immediately because you called the sitter, didn't you?

49
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,170
What?

50
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,640
Didn't you text me?

51
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,190
Wh-What is it?

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,030
We need to find him before it's too late.

53
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,250
Find whom?

54
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,150
Your older brother who went missing.

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,460
Heo Chi Yeong?

56
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,890
Have you talked to him recently?

57
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,310
What's going on that you're bringing him up?

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,570
When was the last time you talked to him?

59
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,540
I don't know. I don't even remember.

60
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,960
How come you never thought about looking for him?

61
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,910
I haven't talked to him since I was 13, when my parents divorced.

62
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,910
It's been 30 years since I talked to him.

63
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,430
He's basically a stranger.

64
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,010
But he's your family.

65
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,630
Family?

66
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,710
He's not my family.

67
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,600
To me, my only family are you and Ah Rin.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,020
What you just said...

69
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,490
Don't ever forget it.

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,880
My gosh. You're an amazing artist.

71
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,430
Who's that?

72
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,990
It's my daughter.

73
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,270
She's so cute.

74
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,220
 Heo Chi Yeong?

75
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,500
 What's going on that you're bringing him up?

76
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,020
 Nam Tae Ju

77
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,190
I requested Heo Chi Yeong's transaction and call history.

78
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,310
I texted you his latest address, too.

79
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,010
Will you go there yourself, by the way?

80
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,860
Thank you.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,490
 511  Dojeong-ri, Amin-myeon, Jangseon-gun, Gangwon-do

82
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,160
Did you find anything?

83
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,790
Yes. I recovered the contacts and recent call records. 
  Call Records

84
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,920
And I found the number he called the most.

85
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,020
- Who is it?
 - The number isn't saved.

86
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,850
He called a number that wasn't even saved?

87
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,850
Recently and very frequently.

88
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,460
Do we need to request to look up the number to find out who it is?

89
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,110
You don't have to. I already found out.

90
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,990
You save the phone number,

91
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,080
check the messenger profile, and you get the name and photo.

92
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,200
So easy.

93
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,700
I know who you think it is. Ms. Seo's husband, Professor Heo Sun Yeong.

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,390
But the name on the profile is Heo Chi Yeong.

95
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,300
 Heo Chi Yeong

96
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,240
Something's fishy, right?

97
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,290
 Hello? Seung Gyu, what happened?

98
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,540
 I asked what happened? Why won't you answer?

99
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,840
 Baek Seung Gyu.

100
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,170
 As the technology continues to get developed,

101
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,410
 we won't stop researching integrated design.

102
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,100
 The man I'm seeing isn't Jae Won's husband.

103
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,490
 It's his twin brother.

104
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,260
 Heo Chi Yeong.

105
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,660
Excuse me.

106
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,160
 Water and sewage bill

107
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,820
Nobody lives there.

108
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,050
Hello.

109
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,450
Do you know Heo Chi Yeong, who used to live here?

110
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,900
Do you mean the young man who used to live here?

111
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,920
He looks like this.

112
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,590
Yes, that's him.

113
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,290
Is he your husband?

114
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,840
He said he wasn't married.

115
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,250
Do you know where he went?

116
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,720
I haven't seen him in a while.

117
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,480
Some say he went to a big hospital because he's sick.

118
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,620
Right. Stop by Seorin Hospital at the intersection downtown.

119
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,780
He went there often.

120
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,210
Okay. Thank you.

121
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,150
- Hello?
  - Mom, I'm sick.

122
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,590
Ah Rin. Where does it hurt? Where's Dad?

123
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,840
They say depression is the heart's cold in modern society.

124
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,870
That's right. A lot of people don't know about bipolar disorder.

125
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,970
Dr. Jo Su Gyeong, could you explain in detail?

126
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,780
Yes. Bipolar disorder.

127
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,430
It's also commonly known as manic depressive disorder.

128
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,290
It's a mood disorder in which

129
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,360
you feel elevated and down back to back repeatedly.

130
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,970
It can change your mood several times a day when it's severe.

131
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,080
 Manic disorder can make you delusional, impulsive,

132
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,150
 and makes you sleep less, too.

133
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,220
 It can cause eating disorders or shopping addiction.

134
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,580
 There are nine major symptoms of depression.

135
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,310
 Lack of sleep, too much sleep,

136
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,080
 difficulty in focusing and making decisions ...

137
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,680
Ah Rin.

138
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,720
I took her to the hospital.

139
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,580
She's okay. Nothing's wrong with her.

140
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,650
But I think Ah Rin noticed

141
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,190
that we're different than usual.

142
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,100
She keeps asking for you.

143
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,550
I am afraid she's anxious.

144
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,720
She just fell asleep after acting grumpy.

145
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Go to bed.

146
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,610
Ah Rin, are you awake?

147
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,540
Yes.

148
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,060
Ah Rin.

149
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,520
Yes?

150
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,650
I'm sorry I've been so busy lately.

151
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,060
Do you like going to work?

152
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,420
Huh?

153
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,660
Yes.

154
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,180
Dad told me that you're happy because you work.

155
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm happy if you're happy.

156
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,060
Thank you for understanding.

157
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,760
But on my birthday, don't go to work, and go play with me somewhere.

158
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,700
With Mom, Dad, and Grandpa.

159
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,650
We all need to go, okay?

160
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,290
Okay.

161
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,650
Yes. Let's.

162
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,830
You mean it, right? You promised.

163
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,500
Yes. Promise.

164
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,390
 Do not enter - Police - Under investigation

165
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,780
CEO.

166
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,310
I'm sorry to call late, but I need to tell you something.

167
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,490
 CEO Seo Jae Won

168
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,220
I heard from Secretary Kim about Baek Seung Gyu's accident.

169
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,920
And that you took him to the hospital.

170
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,460
It was that day, right?

171
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,620
The day I almost got into an accident.

172
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,550
Why didn't you tell me?

173
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,880
I needed to confirm.

174
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,910
Confirm what?

175
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,330
Tell me

176
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,930
everything you're hiding from me.

177
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,060
What is it?

178
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,260
What if I did?

179
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,650
And then what?

180
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,120
What can you do?

181
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,560
You almost died twice, but you couldn't do anything.

182
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Does Baek Seung Gyu have something to do with what happened to me?

183
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,620
Let's go to the police station now. I'll tell them everything.

184
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,810
No.

185
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,790
Why not?

186
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,480
You can't trust anyone, and you're anxious every day. Why try to keep it a secret?

187
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,440
Just what is it for?

188
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
What do you want to protect so much?

189
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,720
- CEO. 
- I'm trying to protect everyone.

190
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,710
My family and work.

191
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,820
I can't give up on either.

192
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,520
Please.

193
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,990
Protect Seo Jae Won first.

194
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,830
Let's stop.

195
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,130
Seung Gyu is the stalker.

196
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,280
The one who broke into the office that day.

197
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,100
And Heo Chi Yeong was the first one he talked to after leaving the office.

198
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,870
Isn't that Seo Jae Won?

199
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,580
It's her, right?

200
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
It is.

201
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,740
Welcome.

202
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
 Heo Chi Yeong?

203
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,700
 Have you talked to him recently?

204
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,880
 When was the last time you talked to him?

205
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,200
 Seung Gyu is the stalker.

206
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,430
 And Heo Chi Yeong was the first one he talked to after leaving the office.

207
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,940
 How come you never thought about looking for him?

208
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,350
 It's been 30 years since I talked to him.

209
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,710
 - How did it go?
 - He's basically a stranger.

210
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,640
 Heo Chi Yeong.

211
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,020
 Why did Baek Seung Gyu stalk me?

212
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,550
Here's the iced coffee you ordered.

213
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,050
My goodness! What do I do?

214
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,900
Are you okay? My gosh! What do I do?

215
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,680
Gosh, ma'am. The blood.

216
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,310
Hold on, hold on. What do I do? What do I do? Wait...

217
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,000
Let me get the first aid kit. Just a moment.

218
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,920
 Seo Yun Jin

219
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,290
 Psychiatrist's Office 1

220
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,300
Oh, really?

221
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,090
 Psychiatrist's Office

222
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,710
 Are you sure?

223
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,990
 I said I definitely saw her.

224
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,480
I always run into her in the hallway. It's so creepy.

225
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,660
How do you think I feel? She's in my class.

226
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,610
You must hate it.

227
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,500
Excuse me.

228
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,790
You dropped this.

229
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,830
Hey, you have blood there.

230
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,630
Do you want to borrow my gym shirt?

231
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,070
Follow me.

232
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,980
It's in the art studio.

233
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,590
 Art Studio

234
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,000
Why? Are you interested?

235
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,490
No.

236
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,720
How's your arm?

237
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,220
Is it okay?

238
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
It's totally fine.

239
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,020
You don't have to hide it.

240
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,230
I'm like this, too. My dad hit me.

241
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,720
Why?

242
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,310
Because I won second place in a competition.

243
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,850
Isn't second place good?

244
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,000
My dad doesn't think so.

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,120
He said it's useless unless you win first place.

246
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,250
Isn't that so annoying?

247
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,080
Was that kind of funny?

248
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,370
A little?

249
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,980
A little?

250
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,080
The wound is deep.

251
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,400
You should go to the hospital.

252
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,680
Being on meds doesn't change a lot of things.

253
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,530
It just makes the rollercoaster-like mood swing a little less severe.

254
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,380
Why don't you take the medicine?

255
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,680
It doesn't let you think deeply.

256
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,140
What do you need to think about that you're going off meds?

257
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,250
You have a hunch about something, right?

258
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,070
I mean Heo Chi Yeong.

259
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,320
 Seorin Hospital

260
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,470
 - How did it go?  
- Well...

261
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,080
Heo Chi Yeong's last visit was in 2015.

262
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,830
I guess he suffered from a chronic lung disease.

263
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,170
 He always visited alone without a guardian.

264
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,810
 He never mentioned having a brother, either.

265
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,880
 He was getting progressively worse, but there was no one to care for him.

266
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,650
He said he'd go to a rehabilitation hospital on his own.

267
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,700
 Check the rehabilitation hospitals nearby, then.

268
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,230
Okay.

269
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,270
Why is everything so easy?

270
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,160
How much will she pay me that she's bossing me around?

271
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,460
What's this? What are you doing?

272
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,340
I'm installing CCTVs.

273
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,330
We finished installing.

274
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,370
- The child's room is upstairs.
 - Okay.

275
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,230
What are the CCTVs for suddenly?

276
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,900
I can't relax because I'm worried about Ah Rin.

277
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,680
Geez, I'm home. Why do you worry?

278
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,220
I'm worried even though you're around.

279
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,740
Gosh. Seriously.

280
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,430
Jae Won, why are you doing this?

281
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,850
You're acting so strangely.

282
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,400
What did I do, anyway?

283
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,840
What are you thinking exactly?

284
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,550
How long do I have to keep up with your erratic mood swings?

285
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,810
I feel so suffocated.

286
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,560
It's for our family.

287
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,220
Hold it, please.

288
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,450
Is it going well?

289
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,100
Who's the person you've been seeing lately?

290
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,350
Why are you curious about that?

291
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,400
He's just an office worker.

292
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,770
Won't you introduce him to me?

293
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,120
Why would I?

294
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,580
You always introduced your new boyfriends to me.

295
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,100
Is it somehow different this time?

296
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,870
Maybe.

297
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,360
All of you will be shocked if you see him.

298
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,510
You're making me even more curious.

299
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,650
Carry on, then.

300
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,310
"All of you"?

301
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,780
 Heo Sun Yeong

302
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,550
Yes, come on in.

303
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,180
Long time no see.

304
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,360
Excuse me for a moment, Te Oh.

305
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,790
I'm so busy because I'll be teaching again next semester.

306
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,590
I tried to finish quickly when I got your call.

307
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,180
I'm all done now.

308
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,460
I recommended him to Derêve.

309
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,620
He has good taste and is passionate.

310
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,810
Seung Gyu can show off his talent if you lead him well.

311
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,650
I wonder if he'll get a chance.

312
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,450
He's at the hospital right now.

313
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,650
He fell from his apartment building.

314
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,700
Pardon?

315
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,600
Wait, how...

316
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
We're trying to find out what happened.

317
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,150
 Tomorrow...

318
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,390
 See you at school tomorrow.

319
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,620
 I need to tell you something about the chairwoman.

320
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,740
 You must come.

321
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,500
 Baek Seung Gyu

322
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,290
Hello?

323
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,200
Seung Gyu, what happened?

324
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,840
 Did you call him not knowing what happened?

325
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:17,200
I did call him to ask about something regarding school.

326
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,750
I guess it was a very urgent matter.

327
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,680
You didn't even have time to check who had answered your call.

328
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,090
Is that why you're here?

329
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,930
I'm sure the police will take care of the investigation.

330
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,760
Or is there a reason why you personally have to do this on your own?

331
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,260
CEO, I got a call from the repair shop.

332
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,640
The car that was in the accident

333
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,190
had a faulty brake pad, apparently.

334
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,860
What caused it?

335
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,740
There's no sign of tampering.

336
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,950
They think it's because it wasn't changed on time.

337
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,680
Are they really sure about that?

338
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,970
I checked through a different shop, just in case.

339
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,170
 Worn out brake pad

340
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,370
How about you hire a different driver?

341
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,250
What else do you have?

342
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,170
This is regarding a TV appearance.

343
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,020
It's a family variety show. It's a popular show with a high rating.

344
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,060
Family variety show?

345
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,050
Yes. You'll have to shoot at home if you agree to it.

346
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,810
With Professor Heo and Ah Rin, too.

347
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,700
I'll think about it.

348
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,330
I'll stop by the Gangnam store and go straight home.

349
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,210
How about the car?

350
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,130
I'll take mine.

351
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,660
 Proposal for TV program guest appearance

352
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,000
 - Ta-da.
 - You're scary.

353
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,770
 It's Dad. It's Dad. I'm Dad now.

354
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,560
 No, I'm Dad now.

355
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,440
 - You have to hug me. It's Dad.
 - Scary.

356
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,430
I'll sleep in the study for a while.

357
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,630
Don't worry about me and go to bed.

358
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,630
 I'm sure the police will take care of the investigation.

359
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:52,060
 Or is there a reason why you personally have to do this on your own?

360
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,890
 Where can I meet Heo Chi Yeong?

361
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,490
I don't know. I'm looking for him, too.

362
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,970
He went missing...

363
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,400
eight years ago.

364
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,220
 Seo Jae Won's mentor, Kwon Yeong Ik, the chairman of Yein Foundation, showed support at the launch show

365
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,240
 List of VIP attendees at 2016 Derêve Launch Show

366
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,130
The chairwoman has been absent from work often and

367
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,820
has canceled important meetings.

368
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,550
There have been complaints among employees.

369
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,660
The sales have been slow since the falling incident, too.

370
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,970
We might need to do something.

371
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,240
Like what?

372
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,430
Well, that's—

373
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,540
Seo Jae Won is Derêve.

374
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,570
Do you have any alternatives?

375
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,570
I didn't mean it like that.

376
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,400
You can leave now.

377
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,990
Okay.

378
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,980
It's an article that will be published tomorrow.

379
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,060
 Seo Jae Won's mentor, Kwon Yeong Ik, is the favored ministerial candidate for the Ministry of Culture

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:10,060

381
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,460
Say ah.

382
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,080
What do you think of the fried rice I made?

383
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,300
It's not too bad.

384
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,210
Not too bad? Is that it?

385
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,440
You're hurting my feelings.

386
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,050
It's a little better than Mom's.

387
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,550
Really?

388
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,330
You're so sweet. That's enough for me. That's enough.

389
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,350
Gosh, you're so sweet.

390
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,000
Hush. You can't tell Mom, okay?

391
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,230
Okay.

392
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,420
- Okay.
 - I heard everything.

393
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,060
You didn't like the one I made, huh?

394
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,200
I'll have to ask Dad to cook from now on.

395
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,710
What do we do? I think she's upset.

396
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,510
I'm sorry, Mom.

397
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,920
What are you sorry for? Tell me more.

398
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,390
I'm sorry, I can't lie.

399
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,920
No, no, no. It's a great thing that you don't lie.

400
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,660
Ah Rin, I make tasty food and play with you every day.

401
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,860
You like Dad a lot more than Mom, right?

402
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,520
I don't think so. You like Mom more, right?

403
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,840
I don't think so. You tell us, Ah Rin.

404
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,380
Who do you like more between Mon and Dad?

405
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,130
You prefer Mom, right?

406
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,180
You prefer Dad, right?

407
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,690
I can't hang out with you because you're too childish.

408
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,390
You hurt my feelings again.

409
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll go to work now.

410
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,580
See you.

411
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,430
Okay.

412
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,970
See you later.

413
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,660
Keep eating. I'll see Mom off.

414
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,170
Jae Won.

415
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,600
You're coming home early today, right?

416
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,300
I will.

417
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,090
Let me hug you.

418
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,660
Have a good day.

419
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,710
Okay. See you later.

420
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,810
Okay.

421
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,530
Okay! That's a wrap. Thank you. Thank you.

422
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,340
- Thank you.
 - Well done.

423
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,120
You're a family of entertainers.

424
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,220
I think our viewers will react positively.

425
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,610
That's good to hear.

426
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,490
So I was thinking maybe we could show

427
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,630
more of the father playing with Ah Rin.

428
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,610
We can air for two weeks if we get enough footage.

429
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,160
Sounds good. Let's do that.

430
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,620
Could we talk for a second?

431
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,200
Okay, let's.

432
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,060
The group shot was great.

433
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,130
You need to leave for the buyer meeting now, CEO.

434
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,110
Okay.

435
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:10,070
I can go by myself. Please stay and keep an eye on them.

436
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,970
Care for Ah Rin, too.

437
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,470
Okay.

438
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,940
Hello, CEO. I'm Park Yong Jin, your new driver.

439
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,120
The police already took the CCTV files.

440
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,640
Could you tell me when that was?

441
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,660
The same day the man from the fifth floor fell.

442
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,020
Do you have a copy, by chance?

443
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,040
We don't have such a thing.

444
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,500
Did they say they'd return it, then?

445
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,840
No. They asked for it in a rush. I didn't get to bring it up.

446
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,210
Please be punctual.

447
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,720
Did you bring what I requested?

448
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,110
There are so many people here. Do you have to do this?

449
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,110
That's why I made you come here instead of me going to the police station.

450
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,180
So you don't get into trouble.

451
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,610
Gosh, shit.

452
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,650
Here.

453
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,440
You said the last time was final.

454
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,330
I mean it this time.

455
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,180
Geez.

456
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,720
I took some pocket money. What's the big deal?

457
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,020
Hyeongnim, how long do you think you can drag me around? Huh?

458
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,930
Let's face it. You're not even a detective anymore.

459
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:50,250
Just keep selling insurance. Why poke around everywhere?

460
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,740
Geez. You got fired acting this way, too.

461
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,570
You got more talkative.

462
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,040
Anyway, I can't this time.

463
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,290
I kept track of all the threats you made.

464
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,670
I could easily use it to—

465
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,170
How dare you!

466
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,780
Shut up, you bastard.

467
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll use it for a few days and return it. Just wait.

468
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,850
Hello, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

469
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,600
How's everything going?

470
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,200
 Well, it's not so easy.

471
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,060
I checked all the rehabilitation hospitals.

472
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,370
They couldn't find anyone named Heo Chi Yeong.

473
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,350
 I think we should check nursing homes or something like that.

474
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,940
Please continue.

475
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,610
 Okay.

476
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,340
Detective Lee, let me ask you one more thing.

477
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,380
Try looking for this person in a week.

478
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,320
There's information on the back of the photo.

479
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,020
Try checking nursing facilities.

480
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,600
And you...

481
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,760
You'd better start talking less.

482
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,920
You know?

483
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,010
Getting fired won't be the end of it if you keep blabbering like that.

484
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,550
You'll die by my hands.

485
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,900
Okay.

486
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,520
 Jae Won.

487
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,200
 You're coming home early today, right?

488
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,870
 I will.

489
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,730
 Let me hug you.

490
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,510
 Have a good day.

491
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,200
 Okay.

492
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,040
 See you later.

493
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,620
Yes, I'll give you a call immediately afterward.

494
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,640
I can't tell you when it'll be shipped since we're receiving a lot of orders.

495
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,940
The server went down because of high traffic.

496
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,570
You need to get it fixed immediately.

497
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,630
Excuse me one moment.

498
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,960
Can we keep taking orders?

499
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,290
Where's the production team leader?

500
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,700
He's reporting to the chairwoman.

501
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,150
All the products that were in the show are sold out.

502
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,400
We'll hire extra people tomorrow to expand the production line as much as possible.

503
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,470
Please check the inventory of the products for next week's show, too.

504
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,720
Okay, got it.

505
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,260
We keep getting requests for interviews and TV appearances since the show was received well.

506
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,570
I should do as much as possible if it helps with our PR.

507
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,900
The thing is...

508
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,090
they want both you and Professor Heo.

509
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,390
All right.

510
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,130
Seong Hee.

511
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,860
Yes?

512
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,630
You can take a break if you're tired.

513
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,450
I'm okay.

514
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,540
Do you know how the investigation is going?

515
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,330
Will they be able to catch the culprit?

516
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,540
Do you think there's a culprit?

517
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,370
Do you know anything, by chance?

518
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,310
I don't, but...

519
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,120
I'm certain he didn't do that on his own.

520
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,100
However...

521
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,170
there's something that bothers me.

522
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,770
I'll be right back.

523
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,380
How long will you do this?

524
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,450
I did as much as I could!

525
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,340
No, no! This isn't right.

526
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,790
I mean, this makes no sense at all.

527
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,330
It was the first time I saw him

528
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,150
getting that angry.

529
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,660
When was that?

530
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,610
Do you remember the date?

531
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,760
Hello?

532
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,850
 I found Heo Chi Yeong.

533
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,530
 I texted you the address.

534
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,080
Okay.

535
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,850
Where are you going?

536
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,070
Let me drive you.

537
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,010
Let's take my car.

538
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,460
You were in a hurry, weren't you?

539
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,200
 Seongsinwol Nursing Home

540
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,340
Don't wait for me. You can leave.

541
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,300
Hello.

542
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,620
How can I help you?

543
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,510
I'm here to see Mr. Heo Chi Yeong.

544
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,240
 You should've come sooner.

545
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,240
 He struggled with pain while he was here,

546
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,460
 but he seemed more hurt by the fact that his family abandoned him.

547
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,830
Get in. I won't ask you anything.

548
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:56,070
 Seongsinwol Nursing Home

549
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,230
Don't tell Secretary Kim about what Baek Seung Gyu did.

550
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,540
The fact that a loved one has another side to them

551
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,880
will make anyone go through hell.

552
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,720
You think not knowing is okay?

553
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,760
Even though she won't know his true self?

554
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,650
No matter how close you are to someone,

555
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,910
you can't know everything.

556
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:46,740
Even married couples who share a blanket have secrets.

557
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,300
If nothing changes by knowing,

558
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,840
it's better not to know.

559
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,590
Have you tried to change?

560
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,940
Get away from reality if it's hellish.

561
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,930
I'll help you.

562
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,620
Sales went up more than 250%.

563
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,170
Not to mention the storefronts,

564
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,950
the online store is attracting more visitors.

565
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,980
Since we're on the topic, why don't we revisit the factory

566
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,280
expansion plan we paused last year?

567
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,610
I already got a lot of investment offers.

568
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,150
Okay. I'll look into it.

569
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,620
Okay.

570
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,770
What's this?

571
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,680
Who wants this?

572
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,950
Ah Rin, isn't that your mom?

573
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,960
No, it's not.

574
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,410
My mom is really busy.

575
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,150
No, it's her.

576
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,670
I saw her on TV.

577
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,290
It's not her, I said.

578
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,460
Look.

579
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,170
Gosh! Daebak.

580
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,630
Aigoo, yes. What did you do?

581
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,760
Did you play in the sand?

582
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,990
Ah Rin. Grandpa is almost here.

583
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:58,430
I'll go fishing with Grandpa.

584
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,400
I'll catch a huge fish, Mom.

585
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,050
I'll be looking forward to it. Have fun.

586
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,840
- Bye, bye.
 - Bye.

587
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,980
Please, take good care of her.

588
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,800
Okay. I'll see her off.

589
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,550
I'll be right back.

590
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,590
 Who is it?

591
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,820
I can go in, right?

592
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,680
How did you find my place?

593
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,320
I told Mr. Kwon that I wanted to treat him to dinner.

594
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,460
He gave me your address so I can bring you, too.

595
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,720
Wait here. I'll call him for a second.

596
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,320
Why?

597
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,780
Will you tell him we had a falling out?

598
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,300
He'll be disappointed.

599
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,960
That's what you hate the most.

600
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,970
Disappointing your father.

601
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,280
It's been so long, Jae Won.

602
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,390
I'm sorry. I should've visited you more often.

603
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,230
It's okay. We know how busy you are.

604
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,480
Where's Mr. Kwon?

605
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,620
He said he's almost here.

606
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,190
Honey.

607
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,440
I'm sorry. Am I too late?

608
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,150
CEO Seo. Have a seat.

609
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,860
Dean Choi said she could look forward to being hired

610
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,790
as a full-time professor this time.

611
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,640
Dean Choi from Yun Jin's school?

612
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,480
It must've been difficult persuading him.

613
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,110
Yun Jin has been an assistant professor for a long time.

614
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,180
Gosh, that's so wonderful.

615
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,590
Aren't you helping her too much?

616
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,770
Does she even deserve it?

617
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,220
Gosh, come on, Honey.

618
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,090
You did the same for me.

619
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,440
When I was in middle school,

620
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,450
you had faith in me, supported me, and invested in me.

621
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,450
It's for the same reason.

622
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,920
The same reason?

623
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,520
Is she holding something over your head?

624
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,910
Pardon?

625
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,680
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

626
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,840
I loved the look in your eyes then.

627
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,520
Shouldn't we get a bottle of champagne?

628
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,870
I ordered it already.

629
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,940
Excuse me.

630
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,840
Where are you?

631
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,880
Okay. Hurry up.

632
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,270
Is someone coming?

633
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,850
You should've given me a heads-up.

634
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,780
 What happened to the other bow?

635
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,080
 You still look pretty.

636
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,460
 You mean the video was edited?

637
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,570
Please have a look at this.

638
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,720
What's this?

639
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,240
It's Heo Chi Yeong's medical history.

640
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,990
He would've suffered without a respirator in this condition.

641
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,950
 When was the last time you talked to him?

642
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,540
 I don't know. I don't even remember.

643
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,630
 I haven't talked to him since I was 13, when my parents divorced.

644
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,910
 It's been 30 years since I talked to him.

645
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,640
So, where's Mr. Heo right now?

646
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,380
He passed away last year.

647
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,940
His younger brother came and even had a funeral. You had no idea?

648
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,310
I invited him.

649
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,600
We should all celebrate this happy occasion.

650
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,830
It's okay, right?

651
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,410
Of course.

652
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,890
- Professor Heo.
 - Yes.

653
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,310
Didn't you walk by our foundation office recently?

654
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,500
Your office?

655
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,990
No.

656
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,870
Maybe you were mistaken.

657
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,600
Really?

658
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,120
You could've said he was your twin.

659
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,670
Are you sure it wasn't you?

660
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,510
Come on. Not you, too.

661
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,490
Have you been well, Ma'am?

662
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,250
You got even more handsome.

663
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,900
Thank you.

664
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,950
Long time no see, Yun Jin.

665
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,140
Yes. Hello.

666
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,670
I think Yun Jin will be promoted to full-time professor soon.

667
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,450
You should congratulate her, too.

668
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,690
Is that why you told me to pick up champagne?

669
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,520
Congratulations, Yun Jin.

670
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,640
Thank you.

671
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,820
Shall we drink, then?

672
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,590
Cheers.

673
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,790
Yun Jin needs to find someone like Professor Heo, too.

674
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,080
Don't worry. She's already seeing him.

675
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,640
What did you say?

676
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,540
Someone like Professor Heo, I mean.

677
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,730
She's dating someone.

678
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,010
Is that true?

679
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,930
Did I make a mistake?

680
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,540
Haven't you told them yet?

681
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,400
Well, we're just...

682
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,790
dating casually.

683
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,000
Introduce us some time.

684
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,580
One, two, three.

685
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,600
Thank you.

686
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:53,950

687
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,890
You must be tired. Go take a shower.

688
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,330
Okay.

689
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,870
Who's been calling you?

690
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,610
It's a friend.

691
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,360
Sang Won.

692
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,760
He keeps asking me to join him for a drink.

693
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,390
I'll have to step out for a second.

694
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,200
This late?

695
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,990
Yes. I guess he's really drunk.

696
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:35,370
I'll be right back. He keeps calling me.

697
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:38,310
Who does he want to see so badly?

698
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,530
Heo Sun Yeong?

699
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,560
Heo Chi Yeong?

700
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,640
Or both?

701
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,920
You'd better stop seeing Kwon Yun Jin.

702
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:06,190
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

703
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:10,510
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

704
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:18,180
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

705
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,170
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

706
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,190
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

707
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,990
♫  There is a night like a lie   ♫

708
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:35,550
♫  hidden within it.  ♫

709
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,470
♫  Following a darkened path  ♫

710
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:43,340
♫  I walked aimlessly and just like that  ♫

711
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:50,340
♫  even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better?  ♫

712
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:55,190
♫  I'm standing at the crossroads where my future fate was determined  ♫

713
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:59,810
♫  and painstakingly inscribed in white ashes  ♫

714
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,630
 My Happy Ending

715
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,950
 How about custody?

716
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,730
 The husband is mostly in charge of childcare.

717
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,870
 He could end up getting custody, too.

718
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,130
 Just one thing. I just need one thing.

719
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:18,830
 I hoped to be a good mother to Ah Rin. If I can't even do that...

720
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,270
 I'll do as you want.

721
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,570
 I think this is for the better.

722
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,670
 Seonbae, have you always been like this?

723
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,320
 Isn't this good for you, too?

724
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,950
 The reason you joined Derêve.

725
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,250
 Does Jae Won know, too?

726
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,250
♫  There is a night like a lie hidden within it.  ♫
