01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:50,450
♫ Will I see the end of the dark sky that's hiding? ♫

717
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:54,420
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

718
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,470
♫ I could fly to the stars ♫

719
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:07,680
♫ The night feels like a lie. It's hidden inside. ♫

720
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,780
♫ Just like a tangled up knot ♫

721
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,700
♫ Just like a sharp thorn ♫

722
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:22,810
♫ If there was an end to the twisted fate, I couldn't be happier ♫

723
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:26,960
♫ The fragments of the emotions I released without thinking ♫

724
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,340
♫ are fading into the darkness like a faded photo ♫

725
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:38,480
♫ I was just not good at getting used to uncomfortable truths ♫

726
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,470
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

727
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:46,600
♫ I could fly to the stars ♫

728
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:54,510
♫ In the black sky, the truth is getting buried over time ♫

729
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,570
♫ I could fly to the moon. (I could fly) ♫

730
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:02,700
♫ I could fly to the stars. (To the stars) ♫

731
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,860
♫ Will I see the end of... ♫

[My Happy Ending]

733
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,820
What did I do in the past, exactly?

734
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,760
I have a history with CEO Seo Jae Won.

735
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,600
Soon Yeong, hear me out.

736
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,670
Where is she right now?

737
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:24,260
You didn't say anything unnecessary, right?

738
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,820
Of course not.

739
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,770
I covered up that case with my own hands.

740
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,360
There's no such thing as an end.

741
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,540
It's another beginning.

742
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,470
I'll come home early starting tomorrow.

743
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,820
Mom, Grandpa said you shouldn't make a promise you can't keep.

744
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,220
Let go!

745
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,600
Did you feel guilty toward me even a little bit?
