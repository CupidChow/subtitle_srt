Thank you. Have a seat.

The fact that Seo Jae Won resigned and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital

The day you found out about your husband's affair,

you had a fall at the Han River, correct?

81
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,280
Was it a mistake because you were drunk?

82
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,380
Considering the height of the railing, it's difficult to fall

83
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,450
by mistake, even though you were drunk.

84
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,930

- I didn't get to see the face.
- Was the face covered?

I don't remember that.

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,130
Wasn't it Baek Seung Gyu who had a falling accident recently?

90
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,390
If you fell due to a threat, why didn't you notify the police immediately?

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Because I didn't want it to get blown out of proportion. At the time, I...

92
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,380
suspected it was my father,

93
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,530
husband, or one of my colleagues.

94
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,970
I completely understand your suspicion, considering the circumstances, but...

95
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:39,590
Was there something you noticed about the culprit at the time?

96
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,460

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,600

How did you acquire the medicine?

103
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,720
It must've been impossible to get without a prescription.

104
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,490
I heard you talked about Dr. Jo Su Gyeong.

105
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,370

106
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,450
Su Gyeong is-

107
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,510
You're referring to her casually.

108
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,140
Because she's my long-time friend.

109
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,430
By chance, can you still...

110
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,530
see Dr. Jo Su Gyeong?

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,010
It's difficult to fall by mistake.

112
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,010
What was their body type?

113
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,990
What were they wearing?

114
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,210
I'll draw blood to monitor drug levels.

115

but you can't remember what the culprit looked like.

117
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,050
It's okay.

118
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,930
Did you have a nightmare again?

119
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,580
What's wrong, Jae Won?

120
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,090
Are you sure you're okay?

121
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,050
Looks like you're having a hard time.

122
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,090

123
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,910
I feel fine.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,950
Did you have a nightmare last night, too?

125
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,650
Yes.

126
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,680
Why do you think you keep having the same dream?

127
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,570
The fact that you have repetitive dreams about the situation you were in

128
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,610
must be because you're reminding yourself of some unresolved issues.

129
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,510
Think about it.

130
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,720
Maybe you've been avoiding it

131
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,870
without facing it directly all this time.

132

volunteered to admit myself.

My wife divorced me, my children left,

167

and I was violent to my mother, too.

168

Seo Jae Won was charged with her husband's murder,

but she was released due to lack of evidence.

451
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,360
In the process, the fact that she was manic-depressive was revealed and shocked everyone.

00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,360
Let's have fun!

719
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,170
Feeling good...

720
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,000
Geez, come on...

721
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,160
Gosh, feeling good. Geez...

722
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,300
- I called a driver.
- I'm so drunk.

723
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,590
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

724
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,210
Hold on.

725
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,760
Here's the car key.

726
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,370
The car is around the corner.

727
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,960
Goodbye now, Hyungnim.

728
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,000
- Be good. Wait.
- Okay.

729
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,560
Thank you!

730
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,240
Shit...

[For Kwon Yun Jin's new beginning]

732
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,030
Looks like you're all better.

733
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,930
I didn't know you'd be here.

734
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,540
I had to come.

735
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,710
I wanted to see the Minister, too.

736
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,250
Everything's good, right?

737
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,170
Let's cut to the chase.

738
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,300
Say it here?

739
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,260
Do you want me to get you a stage or something?

740
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:46,840
The first time I felt certain was at the police station.

741
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,480
You did it, didn't you?

742
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,590
Wait just a moment.

743
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,410
It won't take long.

747
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:41,410
♫ I could fly to the moon ♫

[My Happy Ending]

754
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,130
Isn't what we're planning too dangerous?

755
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:25,450
We can't drag them outside if we don't do that.

756
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,440
You didn't know Kwon Yun Jin's alibi was false?

757
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,720
Good morning. Isn't this considered excellent?

758
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,970
You know what today is, right?

759
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,760
You'll have to make a decision beforehand.

760
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,350
Whether to protect the minister position or your daughter.

761
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,540
How could you do this to me?

762
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,670
Whose side is Nam Tae Ju on?

763
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,320
Baek Seung Gyu. Where did you hide him?

764
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,000
You knew I'd come, but you don't know why I came.
