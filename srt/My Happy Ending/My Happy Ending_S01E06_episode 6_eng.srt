Dad, I'm home.

Yes.

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,750
Dad, why didn't you come out to greet me?

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,030
You promised to go to the playground with me.

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm sorry, Ah Rin. Let's go tomorrow.

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,860
It's okay. I'll give you a pass this time.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,140
Ah Rin, Dad needs to do something right now.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,250
Ask the nanny for a snack.

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,330
What do you need to do?

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,170
I just have to work.

20
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,810
Why are you crying?

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,030
Are you in pain?

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,040
No.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,380
Did you have a fight with a friend, then?

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,170
I had a fight with a friend.

25
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,860
Don't cry. I'll scold them for you.

26
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,290
Will you scold them for me?

27

 Episode 6

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,850
My lawyer told me

32
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,750
that as long as you don't give up first,

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,980
the judge won't give me custody easily.

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,660
But I know you're not the kind who would give up.

35
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,780
I thought about it nonstop.

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,300
How could I have her instead of you?

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,360
But it looks like there are ways to do it.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,900
If you get arrested by chance,

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,050
the judge will change her mind, too.

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,130
Seo Jae Won. How could you—

41
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,310
Let's get divorced.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,970
I'm not interested in giving up anything.

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,610
Prepare a lawsuit if you don't want to leave empty-handed.

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,790
Is this it?

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,800
Is this how weak your will to protect the family is?

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,930
Are you kidding me right now?

47
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,290
I was going to endure until the end, even though our marriage was over, because

48
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,030
you're my child's father.

49
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,530
Because we were a family, as you said.

50
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,020
If you wanted to protect it, I mean,

51
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,190
if you had an ounce of conscience left,

52
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,910
you shouldn't have messed with Ah Rin, at least.

53
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,440
How funny.

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,290
It's interesting.

55
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,500
You endured me? You?

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you really think you have the right to tell me that?

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,510
Do you?

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,140
Get out of my house immediately.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:40,020

60
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,160
 Mr. Heo, a famous entrepreneur's husband and a professor at Hanguk University,

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,760
 is being investigated by the police for attempting to leak his wife's company's design.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,650
 Mr. Heo became well-known by being on a TV show with his wife.

63
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,590
 While preparing for the divorce lawsuit, he's suspected of having taken

64
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,310
 the design and attempting to sell it to a competitor.

65
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,550
 The public is in shock as this is the complete opposite of the image he showed on TV...

66
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,990
It's dangerous to increase the dose. You know that, right?

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,140
 They have yet to release a statement...

68
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,070
Did I do the right thing?

69
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,010
Are you worried?

70
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,850
This was posted to the group chat among the college classmates.

71
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,890
The man who's been frequenting her apartment was indeed Professor Heo.

 You worked for yourself.

81
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,390
 You abandoned your parents and daughter.

82
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,580
 You're where you are because of your family's sacrifice.

83
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,280
 You did that for yourself.

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,710
 You endured me? You?

85
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,340
 Do you really think you have the right to tell me that?

86

You know Reporter Choi, right?

93
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,330
You need to beware of him.

94
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,270
He's amazingly good at detecting the smell of money.

95
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,060
He's willing to do anything if it pays a bit.

96
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,220
How do you know Reporter Choi, Mr. Nam?

97
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,700
We used to run into each other at the police station and...

98
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,050
- This video—
 - Don't worry.

99
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,500
This is the original file.

100
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,260
There's no copy, either.

101
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,440
As for Reporter Choi, I'll take care of him, you know.

102
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,720
I wish you'd discussed it with me first.

103
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,680
It's not necessary for stuff like this.

104
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,420
I know you're busy, Chairwoman Seo.

105
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,580
I found out what happened with the insurance payout.

106
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,270
Let's stop working together now.

107
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,440
Okay, then.

108
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,240
Right. What will you do with the one who reported?

109
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,260
- The one who reported?
 - Didn't I tell you?

110
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,160
Someone anonymously reported that Seo Chang Seok received the payout illegally.

111
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,970
That's how this investigation got started.

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,700
So...

113
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,780
would you like me to find out who it was?

114
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,910
I paid a lot of money for it, but it's not proving its worth as I hoped.

115
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,300
I can't just leave it there if it's just going to be an eyesore.

116
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,110
Don't you think?

117
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,130
Give up on

118
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,070
the teaching position willingly before Jae Won does anything.

119
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,630
I was thinking of doing that anyway.

120
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,100
You said you'd manage yourself. Is this the best you can do?

121
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,780
There was no other man besides Heo Sun Yeong?

122
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,780
End it right away.

123
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,780
- I don't want to.
 - What?

124
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,330
I wouldn't have started it if I were going to end it like this.

125
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,010
They will get divorced soon. We can have a fresh start once they divorce—

126
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,480
You're marrying a man Jae Won threw out, after all.

127
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,850
What did I not give you?

128
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,540
Why do you have to be beneath Seo Jae Won when you have everything?

129
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,470
Please, that's enough.

130
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,650
How long will you keep comparing me to Jae Won?

131
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,270
I really...

132
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,260
- I—
 - Get it together.

133
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,440
The confirmation hearing is coming up now.

134
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,770
Do I have to be a part of cheap gossip because of you?

135
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,470
How could it get more humiliating than this?

136
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,840
I know.

137
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,980
You're about to become a minister.

138
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,500
You shouldn't be the talk of the town because of me.

139
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,940
But Dad, if they find out you invested in Jae Won's company by siphoning the foundation's money,

140
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,280
what will happen then?

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,810
You'd better watch what you say.

142
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,630
Why? Are you scared?

143
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't care what you do.

144
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,210
- Stop meddling with my business.
 - Stop meddling?

145
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,060
Then, you shouldn't have created...

146
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,200
a problem I have to meddle with, to begin with.

147
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,800
You said you needed just one thing.

148
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,250
Was it the reputation as a professor who leaked design?

149
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,060
What happened, exactly?

150
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,660
The president is reconsidering your reinstatement right now.

151
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,810
Did you really do it?

152
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,940
I had an affair.

153
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Gosh. Seriously.

154
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,740
That's insane. Really?

155
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,800
Wow, I never would've thought this would happen.

156
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,300
Of all people, you? Adultery?

157
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,090
Whoa, I just can't picture it.

158
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,450
You used to be all about your wife.

159
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,590
It became certain.

160
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,850
I was certain I should end this marriage.

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,280
 Do you really think you have the right to tell me that?

167
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,090
 Do you?

168
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,690
 Knock, knock.

169
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
I know you're in there.

170
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,270
What are you doing? You scared me.

171
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,460
You got scared.

172
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,640
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,290
It's okay.

174
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,100
I thought you left for the day.

175
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,690
I did, but I had more stuff to do.

176
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,610
The client said they sent an urgent email.

177
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,720
You can check your email at home.

178
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,290
The thing is...

179
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,300
I realized that just now. I'll go home.

180
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,240
Do you want me to drive you home?

181
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
It's on the way, anyway.

182
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,150
You said you needed to check an urgent email.

183
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,230
Well...

184
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,820
I guess it doesn't make sense.

185
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,500
What are you thinking about?

186
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,430
Pardon?

187
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,870
Why are you blushing?

188
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,680
There's no way...

189
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,650
You're touching my hand right now.

190
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,490
Looks like it's a habit.

191
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,300
- Pardon?
 - Do you do this whenever you see a woman's hand?

192
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,660
Geez.

193
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,300
Seriously.

194
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,680
- Well...
  - The door is opening.

195
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,400
Aren't you getting in? I'll just leave, then.

196
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,210
 The door is closing.

197
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,530
 Derêve

198
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't look. I can't stop feeling embarrassed.

199
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,670
I appreciate you stopping by, but I can go myself.

200
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,430
There might be reporters in front of my house.

201
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,560
- Will you be okay alone? 
 - Yes.

202
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,740
Te Oh.

203
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,220
If I did something really bad to you,

204
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,800
would you forgive me just once?

205
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,400
 Derêve | casamia

206
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,740
Tell me first, then.

207
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't let me hear it from someone else.

208
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,520
That way, I can make an excuse for you.

209
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,610
As you can see, I'm not good at improvising.

210
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,000
Seung Gyu.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,220
You should get up now.

212
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,100
We need to find the one who did this to you.

213
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
 Open

214
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,830
 Headache

215
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,250
I won't eat it.

216
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,740
- Just one spoonful. 
 - I don't want to.

217
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,060
Don't be like that and have another bite.

218
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,950
Is something going on?

219
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,440
She's been refusing to eat.

220
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,900
Did something happen yesterday?

221
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,600
I'm not sure. Nothing in particular, but

222
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,170
she kept asking when her dad was coming.

223
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,420
Ah Rin, you should eat.

224
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,230
I'll take you wherever you want to go this weekend if you eat.

225
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,230
I don't want to. I won't go. I won't eat, either.

226
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,720
Ah Rin.

227
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,780
I got your favorite, pizza bread.

228
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,430
Wow, that sounds good.

229
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,940
Here. Look at this.

230
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,760
There's pizza bread and chocolate bun, too.

231
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,790
I don't want them! I said I won't eat!

232
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,800
Heo Ah Rin. What are you doing right now?

233
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Who said you can act up like this? Huh?

234
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,090
I hate you, Mom!

235
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,810
I want to go to Dad.

236
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,290
Dad. Dad...

237
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,650
It's okay, it's okay. Sweet Ah Rin.

238
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,000
You can eat something else if you don't want bread.

239
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,220
Don't cry. Don't cry.

240
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,180
She said Ah Rin won't come to kindergarten for a while?

241
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,960
Yes. I thought you discussed it with her mom.

242
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,700
Yes, well...

243
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,100
I feel like I'm crossing the line by saying this, but...

244
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,200
I don't want Ah Rin to suffer.

245
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,000
She's too young to understand the adults' situations.

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,090
Yes. Got it.

247
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,740
Hello, Reporter Choi.

248
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,230
Detective Nam.

249
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,780
I was worried a lot when I heard you got injured.

250
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,480
Where is it? Here? Let me see.

251
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,050
Why are you freaking out?

252
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,710
You're acting like I hit you.

253
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,920
Just give my laptop back.

254
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,460
You knew.

255
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,450
Why didn't you report me, then?

256
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,770
I assaulted you and stole from you. You should've gone to the police first.

257
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:42,040
But you didn't because there's something on your laptop.

258
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,230
What could it be? What is it?

259
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,860
I don't have to ask. I'll just check. What's the password?

260
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,340
Pardon?

261
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,390
Give me the password for your laptop, bastard.

262
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,650
 Enter password

263
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,030
I knew it.

264
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,430
This bastard really is a stalker, isn't he?

265
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,110
 Date - Recent

266
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,460
Who's this?

267
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,000
 Hello.

268
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,670
Have some tomato.

269
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,490
Have some sausage, too.

270
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,450
And this.

271
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,630
I'll give you this, too.

272
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,040
I'll give you some soup, too.

273
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,040
Huh?

274
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,830
Mom?

275
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,710
 casamia ART SALON

276
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,700
I heard the closets from the new collection are popular.

277
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,670
Yes, Ms. Seo. There are more door design options than before.

278
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,000
There are options for the body and the additional console, too. They're popular.

279
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,660
Which one gets the best reviews?

280
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,100
The ones with the regular doors are popular, too, and...

281
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,790
Here.

282
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:40,840
The new folding doors are contributing the most to the sales.

283
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,590
Pay attention to the customers' reactions.

284
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,780
CEO, I think you should answer this.

285
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,100
- Hello?
  - Why is it so hard to reach you?

286
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,990
It's because of the reporters.

287
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,880
Is something wrong?

288
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,260
Ah Rin.

289
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,290
Ah Rin!

290
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,230
What happened, Ah Rin?

291
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,040
Why are you crying?

292
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,860
What happened?

293
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,350
I don't know.

294
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,760
What's wrong?

295
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,350
Are you in pain? Come here. Come here.

296
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,020
She doesn't appear to be injured.

297
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,510
What's wrong, then?

298
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,990
Ah Rin. Let me look.

299
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,050
Ah Rin! Heo Ah Rin!

300
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,640
Heo Ah Rin!

301
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,440
Dad.

302
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,920
What's wrong?

303
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,220
I called him

304
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,600
because you wouldn't pick up the phone.

305
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,290
Does your stomach hurt?

306
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,570
I'm sorry.

307
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,330
I'm sorry.

308
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,400
Could the neighbors have said something to her...

309
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
That can't be, right?

310
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,850
That's why I told you not to go out.

311
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,590
I can't trap a kid inside for more than a few days.

312
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,840
It must've been so hard for her.

313
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,690
Jae Won.

314
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,470
Can't you just forgive him once?

315
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,870
Do you have to get divorced with such a young child?

316
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,150
Dad, you don't know what he did...

317
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,930
You don't know what he did to me...

318
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,250
I'm sorry, Father.

319
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,860
How's Ah Rin?

320
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,320
She just fell asleep.

321
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,550
You should leave now.

322
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,260
What will you tell Ah Rin when she wakes up?

323
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,800
Or I'll just take her with me.

324
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,400
- There's no way.
 - Jae Won.

325
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,160
Just let him stay here for a few days.

326
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,240
That's for the better.

327
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,360
 You really don't get it?

328
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,710
 Get what?

329
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,930
 I...

330
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,390
 I...

331
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,400
 You, I...

332
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,660
 It's dangerous to increase the dose. You know that, right?

333
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,800
 Kwon Yun Jin

334
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,920
You can't even hold your liquor.

335
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,210
Father.

336
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,960
You know I like you a lot, right?

337
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,750
Of course, I do.

338
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,150
- Sun Yeong.
 - Father.

339
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,010
Is there something...

340
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,710
you should tell me about Jae Won?

341
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,670
I'm sorry, Sun Yeong.

342
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,260
I can't tell you anything right now.

343
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
 Kwon Yun Jin

344
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,860
As expected, your husband is

345
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,830
insisting he's not guilty.

346
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,010
However, the police seemed confident since the evidence was clear.

347
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,590
It'd be great if he is brought into custody, but just getting summoned by the police

348
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,450
would work to our benefit.

349
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,620
Excuse me.

350
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,700
Yes.

351
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,050
Pardon? Really?

352
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,440
We need to secure the medical history first, then.

353
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,000
Don't worry about that.

354
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,110
We can request that the court demand the document.

355
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,590
Okay.

356
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,620
So...

357
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,720
can you check your spouse's medical history, too?

358
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,110
Yes, if necessary.

359
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,950
If a spouse kept a serious illness like a mental condition a secret,

360
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,630
it could be a reason for a divorce.

361
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,440
Is there anything you have in mind?

362
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,940
Did you notice anything about your husband?

363
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,090
Not at all.

364
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,210
You need to tell me if it's the other way around as well.

365
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,870
- Okay.
 - If my client has an issue like that,

366
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,610
I need to know to prepare for it.

367
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
 Jeong Reun Law Firm

368
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,910
Are you looking for something?

369
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,790
I asked if you were looking for something.

370
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,870
Are you looking for something?

371
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,080
Back already?

372
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,040
The line in the bathroom was too long.

373
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,940
So, I just decided to give up.

374
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Would you be okay?

375
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,700
What do you want for lunch?

376
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,750
- Tteokbokki.
 - Tteokbokki.

377
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,720
I knew it.

378
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,760
We've been eating tteokbokki for nine years.

379
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,650
We've been having tteokbokki for 3256 days. Seriously.

380
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,460
Are you still counting that?

381
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,400
Of course. Every day is an anniversary to me.

382
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,030
Huh? What?

383
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,620
I'm hurt all of a sudden.

384
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,960
Am I the only one who's been counting?

385
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,270
Right. Was the professor's son's wedding this weekend?

386
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,480
Did you pick an outfit to wear?

387
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,190
The wedding got canceled.

388
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,060
They apparently broke up.

389
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,240
Why?

390
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,480
The bride has been under treatment for depression.

391
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,340
Depression?

392
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,470
Yes. I suppose it was actually pretty severe.

393
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,510
What if...

394
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,580
I suffered from a condition like that? How would you feel?

395
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,170
I don't know.

396
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,060
You're way too upbeat to possibly be depressed.

397
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm serious right now.

398
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,540
Don't worry. I'll treat you even better so you don't go anywhere near it.

399
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,150
I promise.

400
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,100
It's none of your business. Leave.

401
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes.

402
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,650
It certainly isn't my business anymore.

403
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,740
Ah Rin...

404
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,770
Ah Rin is only turning seven now.

405
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,350
I'm not...

406
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,890
I'm not doing this for my own sake.

407
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,080
I know you can't give up on work.

408
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,290
If someone needs to be by her side, it might as well be me

409
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,330
because I'm her dad.

410
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,050
How am I supposed to trust you?

411
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,810
Try to be honest now.

412
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,120
It's really over between us.

413
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,140
What can't we discuss at this point?

414
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,570
You didn't do that from the beginning, right?

415
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,450
With Ah Rin in the picture,

416
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,850
I know you wouldn't have dated Yun Jin like that, even if you became crazy about her.

417
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,330
Tell me.

418
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,770
Why did you change so much?

419
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,020
In order to hang in there,

420
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,430
do you know what I thought whenever I discovered unbelievable facts?

421
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,490
So, please...

422
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,240
Please explain it to me, at least.

423
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,570
What made you change so much?

424
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,500
What horrible things did I do?

425
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,440
If you knew,

426
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,740
do you think you'd become free?

427
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,730
Jae Won.

428
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,540
I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

429
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,790
I really want you to learn...

430
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,550
what it's like...

431
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,770
to live in hell.

432
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,660
That's all I can say to you.

433
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,370
 It feels like the memory of that day is telling me...

434
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,980
 that I caused all of this misery.

435
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,730
Mom...

436
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,740
I'm cold.

437
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,160
Hang in there for a moment.

438
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,950
We'll soon...

439
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,290
have a happy ending.

440
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,410
 I tried to forget it because I hated it so much.

441
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,000
 I desperately tried to get away from it,

442
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,440
 but that memory comes back to me whenever I reach a dead end.

443
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,840
 As if it's telling me I can never escape it.

444
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,180
I replaced the screen and repaired the motherboard.

445
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,200
It would've been easier to get a new phone at that point.

446
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
Thank you.

447
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,260
 Why can't I reach you? When will you pick up your stuff?

448
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,490
Here.

449
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,010
I had no idea he was in the hospital.

450
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,220
How's his condition?

451
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,040
They're keeping an eye on him since he's still unconscious.

452
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,790
I had no idea.

453
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,400
When was the last time you saw Baek Seung Gyu?

454
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,600
He suddenly said he'd move out of his apartment.

455
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,680
He came to ask me to hold onto his stuff. That was the last time.

456
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,700
- His stuff?
 - Yes. It wasn't anything unusual.

457
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,220
It was just clothes and stuff like that.

458
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,260
Would I be able to see them, by chance?

459
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,590
Yes. Hold on.

Baek Seung Gyu is apparently still in critical condition.

464
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,560
Check how Yun Jin's doing.

465
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,060
Keep an eye on her so she doesn't do anything stupid.

466
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,060
What?

467
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,890
Do you refuse because she's your friend?

468
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,480
Not at all.

469
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,140
Send the charity invitation to Assemblyman Kim, Director Choi of Seowon University,

470
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,690
and make sure to send it to CEO Seo, too.

471
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,850
CEO Seo Jae Won?

472
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,780
There will be a lot of reporters. It needs to look proper.

473
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,920
It'll cause noise because of the recent scandal. Will it be okay?

474
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,310
She needs to make herself useful.

 to live in hell.

481
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,070
 Yes.

482
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,440
It can be either a call or transaction history.

483
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,330
Anything goes.

484
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,810
Get as much as you can as soon as possible.

485
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,780
 Okay, then.

We discussed this last time.

492
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,130
You agreed to sign an artist contract as soon as you finished the mural.

493
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,340
How about we expose his mistress to the public?

The more attention they get, the more people will criticize them.

497
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,950
The public needs to be on your side so the company survives.

498
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,830
I didn't know that condition ...

499
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,100
was still valid.

500
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,920
What if I say no?

501
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,620
That's up to you.

502
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,870
But you can't be picky right now.

503
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,930
What?

504
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,970
You devoted yourself for over 20 years, but you're still unknown.

505
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,510
Don't you know this opportunity is too good for you?

506
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,000
It seems like your pride still comes first.

507
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,740
You're not desperate enough.

508
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,380
Do I have to give up on my artist's pride because I'm not successful?

509
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,210
In any case,

510
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,440
you know how much effort I put into that mural.

511
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,950
But you turned the unveiling ceremony into a cheap scandal.

512
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,210
I didn't expect much from you.

513
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,510
The contract?

514
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,830
Okay. I'll at least look at it.

515
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,370
No.

516
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,440
I changed my mind.

517
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,020
Thinking about it now, you don't deserve this opportunity.

518
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,660
And before you talk about your pride as an artist,

519
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,690
you should try to have some dignity first, Yun Jin.

520
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,910
I'm not the center of a cheap scandal. It's you.

521
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,550
You know, Ah Rin?

522
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,350
I don't care what you two do.

523
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,660
But even if we get divorced,

524
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,520
don't try to go anywhere near Ah Rin.

525
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,100
Okay.

526
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,110
I won't.

527
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,760
But we'll become a family, anyway. Shouldn't we start getting close to each other?

528
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,970
Who's your family?

529
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,350
That won't happen. Don't waste your time.

530
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:34,690
Why don't you worry about your father, who uses me for every event?

531
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,860
You're right.

532
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,860
You're right.

533
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,590
My father.

534
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,000
He tells me to be halfway as good as you whenever he sees me.

535
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,440
I've heard that so much I'm sick of it.

536
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,210
One time, I was...

537
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,740
shaking throughout my whole body.

538
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,220
Be halfway as good as the distinguished Seo Jae Won.

539
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,150
You know what?

540
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,670
You have your family, company,

541
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,440
and your perfect image. You have so much to lose,

542
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,470
but I don't.

543
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,380
He's everything I need.

544
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,290
I can give up on family and art, too.

545
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,170
But can you?

546
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:54,960

547
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,830
 Seonbae Yun Jin

548
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,040
Yun Te Oh.

549
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,710
I can't believe you.

550
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,700
How can you be like this?

551
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,690
I know you're very disappointed in me,

552
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,740
but there's no reason for us to grow apart.

553
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,390
I always remembered you as a good person.

554
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,570
Do you know how you look right now?

555
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,600
Don't call me from now on.

556
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,880
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

557
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,750
Yun Te Oh.

558
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,690
Do you have to go this far because of Jae Won?

559
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,520
I'll say this one more time, but it's not Seo Jae Won's fault. It's your fault.

560
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,070
You ruined everything.

561
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,130
Don't push me too much.

562
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,600
Being pushed into the corner makes me want to lash out more.

563
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,080
This is your true color, isn't it?

564
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,860
Maybe.

565
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,480
Jae Won is showing her true color, too.

566
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,130
The design leak...

567
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,840
Jae Won messed around with...

568
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,120
Sun Yeong's laptop.

569
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,490
Did you not understand?

570
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,320
It was done by your impressive CEO,

571
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,470
who discussed her design philosophy on TV.

572
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,410
To frame her husband,

573
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,780
she gave away the design you worked hard on.

574
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,280
That's who she really is.

575
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,450
What's with you?

576
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,450
You knew, didn't you?

577
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,150
To be accurate, it was me, not Ms. Seo.

578
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,520
- What?
 - So don't try to

579
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,980
put her in a difficult position because of that.

580
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,880
If you take it any further,

581
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,630
I won't just sit back and watch, either.

582
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,360
 Celebrities at Derêve's launch event

583
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,950
Whose phone is this?

584
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,060
Baek Seung Gyu. Baek Seung Gyu.

585
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,710
Baek Seung Gyu. Baek Seung Gyu.

586
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,310
It's all Baek Seung Gyu.

587
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,100
 Kwon Yun Jin

588
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,930
- Yes.
  - Where are you right now?

589
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:37,610
 I got Heo Sun Yeong's call and transaction histories.

590
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,960
Let's talk later. Not today.

591
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,380
-  Where are you? I'll come to meet you.  
 - No.

592
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,490
That won't be necessary.

593
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,310
You came, Jae Won.

594
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,330
Of course, she should come.

595
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,750
She's the Yein Foundation's most successful scholarship student.

596
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,210
How about you? What brings you here?

597
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,380
I don't think the chairman will be happy to see you.

598
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,920
Hold on.

599
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,860
What are you doing here?

600
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,020
You're the one who requested this.

601
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,770
You wanted it as soon as possible.

602
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,830
I thought we were close enough to do this.

603
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,940
Should I tell you one more thing since we got close?

604
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:57,710
Yun Te Oh.

605
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,000
He knew that you tried to leak the design.

606
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,040
You just met Ms. Seo, right?

607
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,530
Who are you?

608
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,260
Don't you know who I am?

609
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,560
I'm not sure.

610
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,940
You have my USB drive, right?

611
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,410
- I'm not sure.
 - There's no point in taking it.

612
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:34,780
I installed a location tracker to prevent leaks.

613
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,410
Take this instead.

614
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,770
Keep it a secret from Ms. Seo.

615
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,410
 Yein Foundation hosted "Charity Night," a scholarship ceremony

616
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,970
 Yein Foundation's Charity Night

617
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:29,040
 Yein Foundation's Charity Night

618
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,780
We can't discuss Yein Foundation's

619
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,730
scholarship students without mentioning this person.

620
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,860
CEO Seo Jae Won.

621
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,990
Please come up and say a few brief words.

622
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:56,860
 Yein Foundation Charity Night

623
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,140
Hello, I'm Seo Jae Won, Derêve's CEO.

624
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:29,140
A lot more reporters came than I expected.

625
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,080
You must find it entertaining that the people involved in the scandal are here.

626
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,750
You must find it entertaining that the people involved in the scandal are here.

627
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,270
I see that.

628
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,450
But tonight isn't about me.

629
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:47,290
Please refrain from getting into it for the scholarship students here.

630
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,260
CEO Seo. There are a lot of opinions about the article.

631
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,960
How much of it is true?

632
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,260
Please comment on it briefly.

633
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,470
Please comment on it briefly.

634
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,640
Please comment on it briefly.

635
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,440
Just comment on it briefly.

636
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,560
Everyone here is so curious.

637
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,810
I'm sure you are.

638
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,640
 How about we expose his mistress to the public?

639
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,840
Do you really want to know the truth?

640
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,960
 Cheater Heo Sun Yeong.

641
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,800
 His mistress Kwon Yun Jin.

642
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,920
 Are you afraid?

643
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,460
 Hello. Will you be okay? You became brave, Seo Jae Won

644
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,410
 You couldn't have forgotten about me, right? - AMI

645
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,010
Sun Yeong.

646
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,790
You didn't say you'd come.

647
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,910
I wanted to check something.

648
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,510
How scary.

649
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,400
Should I be nervous?

650
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,780
Baek Seung Gyu. You know him, right?

651
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,870
Baek Seung Gyu?

652
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,240
Who's Baek Seung Gyu?

653
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,100
I saw this in your car.

654
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,330
That's not mine.

655
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:14,710
I've never seen that before.

656
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,060
That's enough, Yun Jin.

657
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,740
I'm serious.

658
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,570
What's that?

659
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,850
What does that have to do with this Baek Seung Gyu person?

660
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,700
Do you really not know him?

661
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,050
I'll just ask the chairman, then.

662
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:33,350
He probably knows since he was a Yein Foundation scholarship student.

663
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,560
You're acting so strange today.

664
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,620
I don't understand anything you're saying.

665
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,040
Why don't we talk at home instead?

666
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,130
She's here.

667
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,650
How do you feel right now?

668
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,510
Is your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong over?

669
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,580
- Why don't we talk later?
 - Aren't you going to have a press conference?

670
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,780
- Please say something.
 - CEO Seo.

671
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,230
- CEO Seo.
 - Please say something.

672
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,740
I'm sorry. Please stop.

673
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,270
- I'll call you.
 - CEO Seo!

674
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,920
She's supposed to come out here.

675
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,100
I'm not so sure.

676
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,160
- Maybe she took another route.
 - She should be coming out of here soon.

677
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,280
Her car is here right now.

678
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,840
- How long will we wait?
 - Whose car is that?

679
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,580
She hasn't come out yet.

680
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,590
What? What?

681
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,470
- Geez.
 - Gosh.

682
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,800
Pull over. I'll get out here.

683
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,190
I heard you knew everything.

684
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,810
What do you mean?

685
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,490
Oh, right.

686
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,460
How come no one can keep a secret?

687
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,520
Who told you?

688
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,890
I'm sorry, Te Oh.

689
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,600
I'm so sorry.

690
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,240
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.

691
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,990
Would you be able to handle it?

692
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,950
You might think you're hurting him right now,

693
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:26,270
but you'll end up getting hurt the most.

694
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:30,100
Are you sure you won't regret this?

 Hello?

707
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,910
Well...

708
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,370
So is there...

709
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:15,110
 Do you want to take a DNA test, by chance?

710
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,090
Pardon?

711
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,410
 You can relax and talk to me.

712
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:24,380
 You can take a paternity test without identification.

713
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:34,860
 How will I receive the result if I request a test?

714

 Tell us your address, and we'll mail it to you.

 My Happy Ending

749
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:14,720
 Just what terrible things have I done in the past?

750
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,660
 I have a history with CEO Seo Jae Won.

751
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,500
 Sun Yeong, hear me out.

752
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,670
 Where is she right now?

753
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:24,160
 He won't say anything unnecessary, right?

754
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,720
 There's no way.

755
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,770
 I covered up that case with my own hands.

756
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,360
 This can't be the end.

757
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,540
 It's just another beginning.

758
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,370
 I'll come home early starting tomorrow.

759
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:36,820
 Mom, Grandpa said you shouldn't make a promise you can't keep.

760
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,220
 Let go!

761
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,600
 Did you feel guilty toward me, even a little bit?
