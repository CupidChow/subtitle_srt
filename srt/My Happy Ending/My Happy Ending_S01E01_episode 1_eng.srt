♫  I really want to stay in your mind  ♫

13
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,450
♫  In a small space  ♫

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,980
♫  wherever it might be  ♫

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,620
♫  Like the spring which bloomed after winter  ♫

16
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,330
♫  Like the star path in the dark sky  ♫

♫  I promise you  ♫

 Derêve

26
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,900
We'll start the interview.

27
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,860
Could you introduce yourself first?

28
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,110
Hello, I'm Seo Jae Won.

29
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,770
Hello.

30
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,890
Hello.

31
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,880
 I'm the CEO and designer of the life furniture brand, Derêve.

32
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello, Ms. Seo.

33
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,150
Yes.

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,990
Why can't you meet the due date? The order was made long ago.

35
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,240
I didn't call to hear your excuse. 
  May 13, 2023

36
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,000
I hope I don't have to call you about this again.

37
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,910
It absolutely must be by the 15th.

38
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,430
Okay.

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,410
 CEO Seo Jae Won

40
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Did you stay up all night again?

41
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,600
No. I slept a bit.

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,070
- What time is the buyer meeting today? 
 - We have to leave in 10 minutes.

43
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,480
- How about the final proposal for the online ad? 
 - Here you go.

44
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,310
- What do you think? 
- You always look great.

45
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,650
It doesn't sound like you mean it.

46
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,260
I'll work on that.

47
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,500
Did anyone contact me?

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,760
Professor Heo called earlier and asked if he should report you missing

49
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,540
since you left for work sixty hours ago.

50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,640
I might actually get kicked out soon at this rate.

51
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,770
What's that?

52
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,040
Well, this is...

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,950
I didn't think I should get rid of it myself.

54
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,200
 Cheering on Seo Jae Won's new beginning. - Ami

55
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,440
She's been quiet for a while, but here we go again.

56
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,150
Throw it away.

57
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,390
The car is ready. Do you want to leave now?

58
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,500
No, give me just five minutes.

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,630
 Headache Medication

60
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,830
Be careful.

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,850
I need to start over if even one drop gets splattered on it.

62
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,420
- Did you bring the brushes?
 - Yes.

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,090
Thank you. I appreciate it.

64
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,980
It looks great, Painter.

65
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,790
You came.

66
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't you think the colors pop too much?

67
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,060
It's exactly as I wanted.

68
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,690
The lobby will feel totally different when we get a work of art there.

69
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm envious.

70
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,310
Everyone gives up on their dream to make a living.

71
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,530
But you're still doing fine art.

72
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,400
But I don't make any money.

73
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,580
You know my hunch is always correct, right?

74
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,810
You'll become successful soon.

75
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,250
Thank you. This is why friends are the best.

76
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,490
I really mean it.

77
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,710
Don't be a stranger once you become famous.

78
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,680
Gosh. I don't think the already nationally famous CEO Seo Jae Won

79
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,290
should be telling me that.

80
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,660
When will you have a housewarming party, by the way?

81
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,380
You moved more than three months ago.

82
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,320
I haven't even unpacked yet since I've been working here and teaching the class.

83
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,430
Are you hiding a man at home, by chance?

84
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,940
Maybe I am.

85
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,190
It's a good one this time, right?

86
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,740
Let me tell you something, as someone who's married.

87
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,560
Younger men are nice.

88
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,550
Gosh, whatever. You'd better leave now.

89
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,840
Please leave, CEO.

90
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,800
- Carry on.
 - Take care.

91
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,220
CEO, here's the contract.

92
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,930
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Jae Won Seo.

93
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,190
- Nice to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you.

94
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,460
Wow, that's good.

95
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,460
So good. So good.

96
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
There's a bit of a traffic because everyone's leaving work.

97
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,850
Where should we take you, CEO?

98
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,890
Just a moment.

99
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,270
- Honey.
 - Aigoo.

100
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,470
It looks like you're alive, at least.

101
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,320
 Sorry. I've been busy attending meetings and photoshoots.

102
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,420
 Bang!

103
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,730
 Ah Rin, I'll be right there.

104
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,530
Hold on. I'll put Ah Rin on the phone.

105
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,270
Hey, Ah Rin. It's Mom. It's Mom.

106
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,480
 Hi.

107
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,380
- Ah Rin.
  - Mom.

108
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,310
Are you having fun, Ah Rin? Where are you, by the way?

109
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,900
 I'm at Grandpa's to celebrate his birthday.

110
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,770
The cake and present arrived okay, right?

111
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,210
 They did, but...

112
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,110
It would've been nice if you could've joined us on a day like this. Right?

113
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,790
Forgive me just this once.

114
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,300
 Ah Rin!

115
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,870
Grandpa!

116
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,130
 Hold on. Father's here.

117
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,920
Aigoo, aigoo. You came, Ah Rin.

118
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,790
- Hello.
 - Hey. What brings you here without notice?

119
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,750
It's your birthday today. I came to make you seaweed soup.

120
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,640
Aigoo. It must've been difficult to come this far.

121
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,690
This old man's birthday isn't so important.

122
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,000
- How about Jae Won? 
- Jae Won is...

123
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,560
right here.

124
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,700
 I sincerely wish you a happy birthday, Dad.

125
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,190
Thank you, my daughter.

126
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,950
I'm sorry I can't visit often.

127
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm very busy at work.

128
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,690
You're the most successful entrepreneur in Korea. Of course, you're busy.

129
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,260
I'm okay.

130
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,600
You're in good health, right?

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,760
 Yes, of course.

132
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,850
Don't worry about me, and get to work.

133
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,700
You must be busy. Let's hang up.

134
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,460
- Okay. Sure, sure. 
- Excuse me for a second, Father.

135
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,740
All right...

136
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,870
I'll make him a birthday feast. Don't worry so much.

137
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,530
Thank you, Honey

138
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,030
for taking good care of my dad.

139
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,030
At least you know.

140
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,910
And please thank Secretary Kim for me.

141
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,740
See you later.

142
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,500
He got me.

143
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,460
Should we take you to the office?

144
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,740
No. I'll go home today.

145
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,090
 Should we talk about Derêve's philosophy?

146
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm not sure if you can call it a philosophy,

147
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,660
but since I first started the company 13 years ago up to this day,

148
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,120
the driving force for me was my family,

149
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,380
colleagues, and friends by my side.

150
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,240
So, it made me think,

151
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,510
I want to create a space that makes

152
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,760
my loved ones happy, not just for functionality or ease of use.

153
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,390
 That's what we value the most.

154
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,140
- Are you okay, CEO? 
 - I'm sorry.

155
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,790
The car in the front suddenly cut in.

156
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,450
What are these people thinking?

157
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,130
I'm okay. Let's just go.

158
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,380
Okay.

159
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,490
How long will it take to get home?

160
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,640
Secretary Kim?

161
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,330
I think there's an issue at work.

162
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,530
Hello, CEO.

163
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,210
Did Team Leader Yun leave?

164
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,930
Well, the thing is

165
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,330
I don't think he left yet,

166
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,820
but he said he'd step out for work for a sec—

167
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,690
Are you looking for me?

168
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,530
Let's talk for a second, Team Leader Yun.

169
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,040
What's going on?

170
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,280
What's the problem, exactly?

171
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,990
Let's delay the product release first.

172
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,420
We can't.

173
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,480
Since this is Derêve's first appliance, there have been ads and interviews.

174
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,170
Do you know how much we've been spending on marketing?

175
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,850
I said it'd be difficult from the beginning.

176
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,680
Who's the one who rushed it?

177
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,700
You came up with the final design.

178
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,490
Back when it was wireless without the LAN port.

179
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,120
It's not bad the way it is.

180
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,300
But ... is "not bad" good enough?

181
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,590
What happened to the one who said only the perfect designs survive?

182
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
You told me once

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,730
that, even still, you want to be called a designer rather than a CEO.

184
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,790
Are you saying that as the designer Seo Jae Won?

185
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,030
No. I'm saying it as your boss.

186
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,710
I guess you don't know since you grew up in the US.

187
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,160
There's a saying like this in Korea.

188
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,880
"Do it if I say so."

189
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,180
Is that right?

190
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,380
But I know this.

191
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,900
In Korea, they call people who say that a "geezer."

192
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,860
You've come a long way.

193
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,110
My Korean still isn't so good.

194
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,200
That was a compliment, right?

195
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,290
 - Yes, CEO. 
 - Tell Director Park to come in.

196
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,930
We'll rethink the home camera release date.

197
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,530
Thank you. I can't go home again, thanks to you.

198
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,020
Don't mention it.

199
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll leave now, then.

200
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,470
You're going home after making me work late?

201
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,760
Yes. I have a date.

202
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,550
See you tomorrow.

203
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,160
Te Oh!

204
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,050
 You told me once...

205
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,080
 that, even still, you want to be called a designer rather than a CEO.

206
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,330
CEO.

207
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,020
Have a seat.

208
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,090
Here are the files.

209
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,650
You can go home now.

210
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,800
I'll leave, then.

211
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,790
Thank you.

212
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,240
 Has there been a crisis while running the company for over a decade?

213
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,410
 What was the most difficult moment?

214
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,170
 Thinking back now,

215
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,390
 I feel like every moment was a crisis.

216
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,090
 But the most difficult one was

217
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:05,020
 when things rushed in like a storm when I didn't expect them to at all.

218
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,620
 Annual Best Brand Awards

219
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,250
 Don't forgive the one who betrayed your trust

220
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,910
 Yes, this is 911.

221
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,340
I want to report something.

222
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,170
This is...

223
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,300
 Where are you located, ma'am?

224
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,440
 Hello?

225
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,070
 Hello? Ma'am, if it's difficult to say something...

226
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,830
 Ma'am?

227
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,730
 Ma'am.

228
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,190
 D-Talk

229
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,250
 Network connection is poor.

230
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,000
 Is someone in there?

231
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,170
Over here!

232
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,130
CEO, is something wrong?

233
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,060
Over here!

234
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,240
 Derêve

235
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,740
CEO.

236
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,430
Here.

237
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,350
How long have you been stalked?

238
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,540
I think it's been about seven years.

239
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,230
Has he come to see you like this before?

240
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,480
No. It's mostly been texts or emails.

241
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,200
He has sent gifts occasionally,

242
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,910
but this is the first time he has come to the office.

243
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,030
The CCTVs in the office and lobby were undergoing a routine test.

244
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,340
So they didn't record.

245
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,620
Did you know about this?

246
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,590
Yes. They notified us through the company emails.

247
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,540
That means the entire staff here could be suspects.

248
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,010
Is there someone you've been suspicious of?

249
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,750
Would you be able to catch him?

250
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,720
 Security 
 Police

251
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,530
Are you okay?

252
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,250
You came.

253
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm sorry I called you so late.

254
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,160
You'll have to attend the design conference tomorrow in my place.

255
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,350
- I asked if you were okay.
 - I'm fine, as you can see.

256
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,550
It's an important presentation. Study everything before tomorrow.

257
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,370
- Did you get hurt at all?
 - No.

258
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,670
Did you see his face?

259
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,520
Is there anyone you're suspicious of?

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,950
 That means the entire staff here could be suspects.

261
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,640
What do you think?

262
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,610
At the company, has there been...

263
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,460
Never mind.

264
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,790
Let's leave together. I'll drive you home.

265
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,380
I have a meeting early in the morning. I need to check out the stores, too.

266
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,540
Are you thinking of working in a situation like this?

267
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,230
Making sure nothing gets affected at times like this is my priority.

268
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,520
I'll be at my desk. Call me if you need help.

269
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,870
Aren't you going home?

270
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,950
You made me work. You expect me to go home?

271
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,800
 May 14th, 2023

272
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,160
 Casamia Art Salon

273
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,130
- Hello, CEO.
 - Hello.

274
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,900
Hello.

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,530
How are the new products being received?

276
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,920
People love them.

277
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,400
We have had more customers lately. We get a lot of phone inquiries, too.

278
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,380
 Casamia

279
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,180
Ms. Seo Jae Won.

280
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,760
I'll get you someone if you need something, sir.

281
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,430
I wanted to talk to Ms. Seo.

282
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,040
Who are you?

283
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,120
Your mother's name is Jeong Mi Hyang, right?

284
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,960
Wow. It's not easy to meet you since you're so famous.

285
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,510
 Hyeonwon Life Insurance: Inspector Nam Tae Ju  
 I called you and visited the office several times.

286
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,480
You came because of my mom, did you say?

287
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,060
She signed up for one of our plans before she passed.

288
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,340
Her husband, Mr. Seo Chang Seok, collected the payment when she passed.

289
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,970
You knew, right?

290
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,920
My father might've told me once.

291
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,580
He told you how much it was, too?

292
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,490
I told him to use it since it's not that much.

293
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,680
Wow. You're generous since you're a CEO.

294
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,950
Five hundred million won isn't much money?

295
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,140
Your mother died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, correct?

296
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,860
Did she have any pre-existing conditions when she was alive?

297
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,810
Don't you investigate that before you send the payout?

298
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,100
We do, but...

299
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,170
Let's get to the point.

300
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,310
I'll be honest with you.

301
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,880
There was something we missed while investigating then.

302
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,500
 Your mother had visited the ER three times for taking pesticide before she passed.

303
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,000
 And Mr. Seo accompanied her each time.

304
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,120
The hospital said she drank it by mistake each time,

305
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,490
but unless it was on purpose or someone gave it to her,

306
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,940
it's not easy to drink it by mistake three times.

307
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,540
Don't you think?

308
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,540
So?

309
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,200
I think...

310
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,100
- Mr. Seo Chang Seok—
 - You're wrong.

311
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,120
You're so sure.

312
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,920
Because he's my father.

313
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,240
Right. He's your father.

314
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,380
Do you have evidence

315
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,030
to prove my father was involved?

316
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,150
Well, I'm looking into it.

317
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,770
Let me make this clear.

318
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,790
I won't just sit still if this gets leaked without firm evidence.

319
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,000
Got it.

320
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,000
 Grandpa, me, Dad - Happy birthday ♥

321
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,300
 Grandpa

322
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,870
Let me tell you one last thing.

323
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,010
Mr. Seo isn't your biological father, is he?

324
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:04,700
According to the record, your mother remarried in 1988.

325
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,720
That means he's your stepfather.

326
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,310
Would you like a cup, too?

327
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,580
That's not going to work.

328
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,320
I know you're jumping ahead since you came home in three days.

329
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,440
I just feel like I'm finally relaxing right now.

330
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,330
Wow, I almost fell for it.

331
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,450
No, no. Have a seat.

332
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,560
Come on.

333
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,450
Let's talk a bit.

334
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,720
What?

335
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,940
Something happened, didn't it?

336
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,580
I can just tell from your face.

337
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,860
What is it? Tell me.

338
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,380
Okay. Tell me when you feel like it.

339
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,170
I can wait...

340
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,040
no matter how long it takes.

341
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,740
Someone from an insurance company visited me today.

342
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,400
Insurance company?

343
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,190
My mom apparently had life insurance.

344
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,460
Dad received the insurance money after she passed.

345
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,820
She apparently went to the emergency room

346
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,950
three times after taking pesticide.

347
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,430
- What do you mean—
 - According to the insurance company,

348
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,730
her death...

349
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,230
I mean, my dad—

350
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,050
Are you saying it has to do with him?

351
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,520
Come on. That makes no sense.

352
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,990
You know better than anyone that he wouldn't ever do such a thing.

353
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,500
You're not thinking that, are you?

354
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,010
I don't know.

355
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,260
You came.

356
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,530
Yes, CEO.

357
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,080
 May 15th, 2023. The day of the accident  
 Princess, did you sleep well?

358
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,680
Yes.

359
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,220
Let me do it.

360
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,400
How's the kindergarten these days?

361
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,780
Are you having fun with your friends?

362
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,770
You know how kids play.

363
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,880
It's boring.

364
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,230
How are things with your boyfriend? Who was it?

365
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,850
Was it Do Yun?

366
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,240
It's not Do Yun. It's Han Gyeol. Right, Ah Rin?

367
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,490
Good morning. Hello, Ma'am.

368
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,200
Did you sleep well?

369
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,420
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

370
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,780
What were you guys talking about?

371
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,510
About Ah Rin's boyfriend.

372
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,020
Oh, Seo Jun?

373
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,200
What? Did you tell her about him already?

374
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,190
What's that?

375
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,750
What? Heo Ah Rin. How many boyfriends do you have?

376
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,160
Being too popular is tiring.

377
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,790
What happened to Seo Jun? Did you dump him?

378
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,010
Here.

379
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,840
J-Jae Won.

380
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,620
Will you be okay? About Father, I mean.

381
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,260
Yes. I'll get going.

382
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,710
Bye.

383
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,350
I'll check and get back to you.

384
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,100
When can I receive the sample?

385
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
If so—

386
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:14,990

387
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,610
Are you okay?

388
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,770
Yes.

389
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,770
 The door will close.

390
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,830
Hello? I'm sorry. I'll call you back. Yes.

391
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,800
Yes, Reporter Choi.

392
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,080
CEO Seo, everything's okay, right?

393
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,960
I've been hearing bad rumors lately.

394
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,480
I heard there was an incident at the office a few days ago.

395
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

396
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,470
 Don't be like that.

397
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,530
I heard the police came, too.

398
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
You're mistaken.

399
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,120
That never happened.

400
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,370
What's my schedule today?

401
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:49,010
There will be an interview and a new product promotional video at the Gangnam store.

402
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
This is the promotional article to send to the press.

403
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,230
Call the police.

404
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,140
Tell them to stop investigating since it wasn't a stalker.

405
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,200
Pardon? Why, all of a sudden—

406
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,720
The article can't come out at times like this.

407
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,810
Got it.

408
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,710
 That means the entire staff here could be suspects.

409
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,570
 You came up with the final design.

410
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,030
 Parking Ticket. License number: 88PA0505. Arrival time: 4:41 p.m. 2023/05/13

411
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,910
I'll stop by somewhere and go straight to the store.

412
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,790
Hello.

413
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,810
You want to remove the car now?

414
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,290
No, I left something in the car.

415
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,060
I'll need the key.

416
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,540
 88PA0505

417
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,030
I took the wrong key.

418
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,040
All right.

419
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,160
 88PA0505

420
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,960
 Yes, CEO Seo.

421
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,540
 Hello?

422
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,660
Where are you right now?

423
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,160
 Why?

424
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,700
I'm working right now.

425
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,460
Please answer the phone. Please...

426
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,290
Yes, Ms. Seo.

427
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,790
Please put Professor Heo on the phone.

428
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,000
 He's not home right now.

429
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,670
 He usually works out around this time.

430
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,260
 He's probably at the gym he usually goes to.

431
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,390
 The Running

432
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,830
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

433
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,740
Could you call Heo Sun Yeong for me?

434
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,770
Just one second.

435
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,250
He's no longer a member here.

436
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,090
He stopped coming about three months ago.

437
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,950
 Once you experience a crisis like that,

438
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:28,200
 even small things make you very wary

439
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,460
 and you can no longer trust anyone.

440
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,580
 Even if it's someone you were positive was on your side,

441
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,230
you can't just do nothing and get betrayed again.

442
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,970
What's wrong with me?

443
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,460
 Eighth wedding anniversary

444
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,070
 Where are you?

445
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,060
 I'm arriving soon.

446
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,500
 Derêve IT Team Leader Yu

447
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,190
Yes, CEO.

448
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,720
Well...

449
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,090
Team Leader Yu ...

450
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,120
Can smart watches...

451
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,310
be tracked for location, too?

452
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,030
Well, if you have a few pieces of information.

453
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,310
 The Running

454
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,480
 The location is coming up on the map,

455
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,920
 but it can be off by about 30 meters.

456
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,530
Hey, Yun Jin.

457
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,090
 Hey. Are you busy?

458
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,700
It's nothing urgent.

459
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,010
I just heard from Secretary Kim

460
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:04,150
that there will be an unveiling ceremony when I finish the work.

461
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,740
You've been working so hard.

462
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,490
We should let everyone know and celebrate.

463
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,530
 I really don't know what to say.

464
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm sorry it took so long.

465
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,350
I should've done something like that sooner.

466
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,340
No. I...

467
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,330
I really appreciate it.

468
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,350
You know, right, Jae Won?

469
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,860
You're the only one I have.

470
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,550
Of course, I do.

471
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,250
 By the way, why do you sound so down?

472
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,870
Is something going on?

473
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,340
No, it's nothing.

474
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,670
 Hello? Jae Won.

475
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,320
I'm sorry, Yun Jin.

476
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,050
I'm sorry. Let's talk later.

477
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,980
 Oh, okay. All right, then.

478
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,050
- Hey.
  - CEO, you're on your way, right?

479
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,470
I am. I won't be late.

480
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,480
Okay.

481
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:49,170
♫  What would it have been like if we hadn't become like that?  ♫

488
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:20,230
Derêve's new desk is a smart piece of furniture.

489
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,880

♫  Will you also look back sometimes?  ♫

495
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,170
CEO, should we take a break?

496
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,360
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

497
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,080
Just one second.

498
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,700
We'll take a 10-minute break.

499
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,470
♫  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  ♫

♫  I'm left alone in the dark, I'm searching for the light which is you  ♫

507
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,350
Wait.

508
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,230
Where are you going?

509
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,310
Why do you ask?

510
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:48,390
I heard you've been feeling ill throughout the interview.

511
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,980
I'm okay. Don't worry.

512
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,700
How could I not worry?

513
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,020
Won't you tell me what's going on—

514
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,500
What's wrong?

515
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,100
What do you mean?

516
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,550
Are you hiding something from me by chance?

517
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,760
Tell me.

518
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,170
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

519
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,430
Who the hell are you, exactly?

520
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,350
What are you talking about right now?  Let's go talk somewhere.

521
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,980
I don't want to.

522
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,900
 My father, who worked hard to raise me.

523
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,730
 My husband, who's been sacrificing to care for me.

524
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,820
 And my colleagues who've been making

525
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,330
 the company grow throughout the difficult times.

526
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:01,390
 I think I'm here thanks to them.

527
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,480
 Be careful. It's dangerous to be out alone at night.

528
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:09,510
 Be careful. It's dangerous to be out alone at night.

529
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,850
Are you okay?

530
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,140
Excuse me.

531
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,590
Yes. I'm okay.

532
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,960
Wh-What's going on?

533
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,040
The thing is...

534
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,700
Are you okay?

535
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,410
 Derêve

536
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,650
I-It's nothing.

537
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,160
It's nothing.

538
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,930
 Let's circle around one more time.

539
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,080
Okay, got it.

540
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,040
 I found her!

541
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:58,810
Excuse me. I got a call. I'm looking for Seo Jae Won.

542
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,770
Honey.

543
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,690
Honey. Jae Won.

544
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,450
What happened?

545
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,530
What? What's going on?

546
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,200
- Father.
 - Jae Won.

547
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,420
Open your eyes. Dad is here.

548
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:40,040
She wasn't seriously injured, but she's not fully conscious yet.

549
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,450
They need to monitor, apparently.

550
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,130
Gosh.

551
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,730
Father.

552
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,310
Aigoo.

553
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:53,210
What was she doing at Han River so late at night?

554
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,940
I know.

555
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,210
CEO.

556
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,190
Jae Won.

557
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,130
Honey. Are you awake now?

558
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,440
CEO.

559
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,720
Honey.

560
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,730
- Jae Won.
 - Patient Seo Jae Won woke up.

561
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,640
Jae Won. Look at me.

562
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,720
Are you awake? Look at me.

563
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,440
Jae Won.

564
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,180
Excuse me!

565
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,140
Aigoo. Thank you.

566
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,440
 Lastly,

567
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,030
 please say something to your father, husband,

568
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:44,830
 and colleagues who let you be here today.

569
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:10,170

570
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,170
 Just wait and see.

571
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,790
 I'll let you...

572
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,240
 also experience the hell I'm going through.

573
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,760
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

574
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,960
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

575
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:45,800
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

576
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,740
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

577
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:53,740
♫  I could fly to the stars  ♫

578
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,610
♫  There is a night like a lie hidden within it  ♫

579
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:03,020
♫  It's hidden inside.  ♫

580
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:10,960
♫  Following a darkened path I walked aimlessly  ♫

581
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,430
♫  Even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better?  ♫

582
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,780
♫  Standing on the ashes burned white  ♫

583
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,820
 My Happy Ending

584
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,130
 Find out how my mom died.

585
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:34,930
 Don't neglect anything and do it for me.

586
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,450
 Is something going on with you lately?

587
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,440
 Wait until I figure things out.

588
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,570
 It shows what time he got home.

589
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:48,300
 You want to believe it's not true, right?

590
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,340
 I'm talking about our baby.

591
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,960
 Did Yun Jin come, too?

592
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,700
 Where is that?

593
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,760
 I want to stomp on him and kill him.

594
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,050
♫  The night like a lie  ♫
