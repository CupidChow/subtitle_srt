I'm not sure if you can call it a philosophy,

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,660
but since I first started the company 13 years ago to this day,

154
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,120
the driving force for me was my family,

155

colleagues, and friends by my side.

156
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,240
So, it made me think...

157
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,610
I want to create a space that makes

159

161
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,790

167
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,330

Well, the thing is...

171
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,430
I don't think he left yet,

172
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,920

173

Since this is Dereve's first appliance, there have been ads and interviews.

Do you know how much we've been spending on marketing?

181
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,950
I said it'd be difficult from the beginning.

182
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,680
Who's the one who rushed it?

183
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,700
You came up with the final design.

184
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,490
Back when it was wireless without the LAN port.

185
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,420
It's not bad the way it is.

186
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,600
Is "not bad" good enough?

187
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,390
What happened to the one who said only the perfect designs survive?

188
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
You told me once...

189
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,830
that you want to be called a designer rather than a CEO.

190
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,790
Are you saying that as the designer Seo Jae Won?

191
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,130
No. I'm saying it as your boss.

192
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,710
I guess you don't know since you grew up in the US.

193
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,260
There's a saying like this in Korea.

194
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,780
"Do it if I say so."

195
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,180
Is that right?

196
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,380
But I know this.

197
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,700
In Korea, they call people who say that a "geezer."

198
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,960
You've come a long way.

199
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,110
My Korean still isn't so good.

200
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,100
That was a compliment, right?

201
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,290
- Yes, Ms. Seo.
- Tell Director Park to come in.

202
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,030
We'll rethink the home camera release date.

203

Thank you. I can't go home again, thanks to you.

204
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,120
Don't mention it.

205
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,740
I'll leave now, then.

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,470
You're going home after making me work late?

00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,860
Yes. I have a date.

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,550
See you tomorrow.

Te Oh!

210
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,150
You told me once...

211
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,980
that you want to be called a designer rather than a CEO.

212
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,330

Here are the files.

You can go home now.

I'll leave, then.

217
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,690
Thank you.

218
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,240
Has there been a crisis while running the company for over a decade?

219
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,410
What was the most difficult moment?

220
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,270
Thinking back now,

221
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,390
I feel like every moment was a crisis.

222

How long have you been stalked?

242
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,640
I think it's been about seven years.

243

Has he come to see you like this before?

244
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,580
No. It's mostly been texts or emails.

245
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,300
He has sent gifts occasionally,

246
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,910
but this is the first time he has come to the office.

247
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,440
The CCTVs in the office and lobby were undergoing a routine test. So they didn't record.

248
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,620
Did you know about this?

249
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,590
Yes. They notified us through the company emails.

250
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,440
That means the entire staff here could be suspects.

251
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,010
Is there someone you've been suspicious of?

252
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,510
Would you be able to catch him?

Are you okay?

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,250
You came.

- No.

She signed up for one of our plans before she passed.

He told you how much it was, too?

292
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,590
I told him to use it since it's not that much.

Wow. You're generous since you're a CEO.

And Mr. Seo accompanied her each time.

Are you having fun with your friends?

361
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,870
You know how kids play.

362
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,880
It's boring.

363

How are things with your boyfriend? Who was it?

364
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,950
Was it Do Yoon?

365
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,240
It's not Do Yoon. It's Han Gyeol. Right, Ah Rin?

366
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,390
Good morning. Hello, Ma'am.

372
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,200

What's that?

00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,850
What? Heo Ah Rin. How many boyfriends do you have?

375
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,260
Being too popular is tiring.

I've been hearing bad rumors lately.

Tell them to stop investigating since it wasn't a stalker.

403
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,300
Pardon? Why, all of a sudden-

404
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,300
The article can't come out at times like this.

405
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,710
Got it.

406
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,710

414
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,030

01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,450
What happened?

540
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,530
What? What's going on?

541
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,200
- Father.
- Jae Won.

542
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,420
Open your eyes. Dad is here.

543
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:39,940
She didn't get injured seriously, but she's not fully conscious yet.

544
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,450
They need to keep an eye on her, apparently.

545
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,130
Gosh.

546
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,730
Father.

547
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,310
Aigoo.

548
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:53,210
What was she doing at Han River so late at night?

549
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,840
I know.

550
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,210
Ms. Seo.

551
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,290
Jae Won.

552
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,930
Honey. Are you awake now?

553
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,440
Ms. Seo.

554
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:12,820
Honey.

555
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,730
- Jae Won.
- Patient Seo Jae Won woke up.

556
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,640
Jae Won. Look at me.

557
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,020
Are you awake? Look at me.

558
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,440
Jae Won.

559
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,180
Excuse me!

560
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,140
Aigoo. Thank you.

561
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,540
Lastly,

562
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:39,030
please say something to your father, husband,

563
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:44,830
and colleagues who let you be here today.

564
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,170
Just wait and see.

565
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,790
I'll let you...

566
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,240
also experience the hell I'm going through.

♫ I can fly to the stars ♫

569
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:45,900

[My Happy Ending]

577
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,130
Find out how my mom died.

578
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,530
Don't neglect anything and

579
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,020
do it for me.

580
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,550
Is something going on with you lately?

581
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,240
Wait until I figure things out.

582
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,870
It shows what time he got home.

583
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,200
You want to believe it's not true, right?

584
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,440
I'm talking about our baby.

585
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,060
Did Yoon Jin come, too?

586
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,760
Where is that?

587
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,800
I want to stomp on him and kill him.
