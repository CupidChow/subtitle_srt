00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,140
 Jang Na Ra

2
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,910
 Son Ho Joon

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,910
 So Yi Hyeon

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,580
 Lee Gi Taek

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,040
 Kim Hong Pa

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,230
 Park Ho San

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,060
 My Happy Ending

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,110
 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents, and situations in this drama are fictitious.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,550
 My Happy Ending

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,410
But I noticed something last time.

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,390
They say daughters usually resemble their dads.

12
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,220
But Ah Rin doesn't seem to resemble you.

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,510
- Don't you think?
 - What are you talking about?

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,590
Her nose and mouth are exactly like his.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,100
I know.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,370
You don't know because you never got a proper look at Ah Rin.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Ah Rin resembles me a lot.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
That's not true.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,820
I got a good look.

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,440
I noticed how she looked so pretty on the variety show.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,520
Variety show?

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,020
Did Ah Rin go on a variety show?

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,740
How strange.

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,100
Didn't she?

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,330
It will come up if you look it up.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,490
Never mind. There's no need to look that up now, right?

27
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,400
What are you all doing right now?

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,320
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,010
No. It's not like that, Jae Won.

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,490
There's something I don't know, right?

31
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,830
Yun Jin, you tell me. What am I missing here?

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,590
Do you really want me to tell you?

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,270
Where should I begin?

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Your divorce that you want to believe is a rumor?

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,980
Or Professor Heo leaking the design?

36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,980
If it's not that—

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,680
What else is there?

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
Will you continue to keep your mouth shut?

39
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,260
Why don't you try to explain, at least?

40
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,640
What happened, anyway, Sun Yeong?

41
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,350
Jae Won.

42
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,000
Please trust me.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,640
I beg you.

44
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,270
 Episode 9  
 Is it fun to have a gathering like this

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,640
with someone who doesn't know anything?

46
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,040
What did I do?

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,470
I was just talking about the past a bit.

48
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,930
But everyone was freaking out on their own. It was kind of fun.

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,450
What do you get from doing all this?

50
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,620
Have you ever...

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,060
thought about why I'm doing this?

52
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,150
If you expect to be understood after doing something like this—

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,810
You'll have to understand from now on.

54
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,350
How old was Ah Rin again?

55
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,820
 Derêve says Heo Sun Yeong released confidential information by leaking a design.

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,030
Depersonalization?

57
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,050
It's a condition where you feel unfamiliar with yourself like you're someone else.

58
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,520
You feel like the person in the mirror isn't you.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,780
And if you spend emotional energy because of the suppressed memory,

60
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,830
symptoms of short-term memory or anxiety could show up.

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,760
Do you really...

62
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,320
want to learn about erased memory?

63
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,030
Or do you have a guess, but are you avoiding it?

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,310
I'm not sure.

65
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,670
But I don't think I should unearth this memory.

66
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,020
That way, everyone can be happy.

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,930
But you aren't a part of that "everyone."

68
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,360
 Hyeonwon Life Insurance: Inspector Nam Tae Ju

69
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
Nam Tae Ju.

70
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,870
 25th. Nam Tae Ju. Police investigation. Custody.

71
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,270
Rich families definitely are different.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,250
Who's this?

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,570
They discussed getting married, but they broke the engagement.

74
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,430
I guess he's famous. There was an article on the internet.

75
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,390
Where did I see him?

76
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,770
He looks familiar.

77
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,930
This is where I saw him.

78
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,440
Hello. It's been a while, CEO Seo.

79
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,400
No matter what you do, nothing changes anymore.

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,600
So, stop acting crazy.

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Seriously...

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,170
I haven't even started acting crazy.

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,440
How's Jae Won?

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,090
She has no memory yet, right?

85
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,630
You're really out of your mind.

86
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,510
What are you so proud of, exactly?

87
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,230
Did you forget?

88
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,650
You're the one who started, Mr. Heo Sun Yeong.

89
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,710
I'll face the consequences for what I did.

90
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,920
So, you should be responsible for what you did, too.

91
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,710
Seo Jae Won is the one who should start being responsible.

92
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,760
Wh-What do you want?

93
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Why are you so obsessed with her?

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,850
This is all your fault.

95
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,990
It's because of you! You destroyed my dream for the three of us to be together.

96
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,840
If you keep...

97
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,090
If you keep acting this way,

98
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I really...

99
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,580
I really won't just sit still.

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,420
Seriously.

101
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,850
What will you do if you don't sit still?

102
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,110
Is it because you have that stupid audio file? Go ahead.

103
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,560
Then, I'll tell Jae Won you aren't Ah Rin's biological father.

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,630
I'm curious...

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,650
to see Jae Won's face...

106
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,070
if she finds out the whole truth.

107
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,010
Have we met before?

108
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,430
I don't get why you're asking me that.

109
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,640
Could you explain this to me?

110
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,340
 25th. Nam Tae Ju. Police investigation. Custody.

111
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,670
I think it's regarding the recent design leak incident.

112
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,470
Professor Heo tried to sell Derêve's design to a competitor and was investigated by the police.

113
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,220
Does that answer your question?

114
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,420
Are you certain my husband leaked our design?

115
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,480
That's what the media said...

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,180
That's what you wanted.

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,630
Are you really asking because you don't know?

118
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,420
I'll be the only one asking questions today.

119
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,050
You're saying that's what I wanted?

120
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,580
You framed him so you can have custody in the divorce lawsuit.

121
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,510
Custody?

122
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,230
I need reassurance.

123
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,860
What would you want from me?

124
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,140
 What are you doing?

125
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,280
 Seo Jae Won! Hey! Don't do it.

126
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
 Let go. Let go!

127
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,570
 Don't do it. Hey. Seo Jae Won.

128
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,990
 Hey!

129
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,740
 Hey!

130
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,780
 You prefer Dad, right?

131
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,900
 I can't hang out with you because you're too childish.

132
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,210
 You wanted to know Yun Te Oh's immigration records, right?

133
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,400
 I found Heo Chi Yeong.

134
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,760
 I got Heo Sun Yeong's call and transaction histories.

135
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,890
 Is this reality...

136
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,780
 or is it a terrible nightmare?

137
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,200
This is crazy.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,910
When did you go out, anyway?

139
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,800
Where were you all this time?

140
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,030
Do you know how much I worried?

141
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,290
Jae Won.

142
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,520
I saw everything.

143
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,770
Our divorce articles.

144
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,660
And the things I've done.

145
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,550
But I don't remember.

146
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,950
I'm definitely in the articles and videos,

147
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,690
but it doesn't feel like me, no matter how much I try to remember.

148
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
I feel so unfamiliar, and I'm scared of myself.

149
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,990
It doesn't feel real.

150
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,950
I-I want everything to be a dream.

151
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,960
Wh-Who am I, Honey?

152
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,450
Say something to me. Please? Please?

153
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,490
- I'm sorry.
 - It's because of me, right?

154
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,460
The reason we were trying to get divorced, right?

155
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,780
No. Jae Won. I swear it's not like that.

156
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,840
Is it because I won't be able to handle it?

157
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,700
- Huh?
 - No, Jae Won.

158
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,410
I swear it's really not like that.

159
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,470
I just...

160
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,140
I just...

161
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,570
wanted to protect everyone. That's why I did that.

162
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,430
That's all there is to it.

163
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,500
Okay.

164
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,560
I won't ask anymore.

165
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,410
I'm not the only one who's trying hard.

166
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,870
You shouldn't overdo it, either.

167
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,450
Are these all the design concepts and floor plans?

168
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,430
- Yes, ma'am.
 - Are you sure?

169
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,960
Pardon?

170
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,290
We can't make mistakes.

171
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,800
Bring me not just the floor plan but the cross-sectional diagram, landscape layout plan,

172
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,610
and everything related to the floor plan, too.

173
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,110
I also want to see all the other design directions, not just the final one.

174
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,920
You want all of those?

175
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,640
I wanted to check one more time.

176
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,780
Okay, got it.

177
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,080
CEO, Painter Kwon is here.

178
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,350
Tell her to come in.

179
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,590
You got home safely that night, right?

180
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,490
I don't think I should've said those things. I felt kind of bad.

181
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,560
That's enough, Yun Jin.

182
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,700
You knew from the beginning, didn't you?

183
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,600
You knew everything, but you pretended to worry about me,

184
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,510
and you kept fishing for information by

185
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,290
bringing up the past I didn't remember.

186
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,730
What's the reason?

187
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,910
I was wondering, but...

188
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,740
it looks like you don't have your memory back.

189
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,410
Yes. This is Seo Jae Won.

190
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,970
This is your method.

191
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,120
You scrape everything and run away if you can't handle it.

192
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,040
You did that when you were 15,

193
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,700
seven years ago,

194
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,870
and even now.

195
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,160
You haven't changed at all.

196
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,670
Are you curious why I'm doing this?

197
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,240
Go ask your husband, then.

198
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,330
He knows better than anyone.

199
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,910
I'm sorry, but...

200
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,140
I no longer...

201
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,650
have trust in you.

202
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,980
Are you sure you won't regret saying that

203
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,590
when you get your memory back?

204
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,300
I'm not sure. How about you?

205
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,060
Would you be able to handle it...

206
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,440
when all of my memory comes back?

207
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,750
 010-071-3520

208
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,240
Hello?

209
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,770
Who did you say you are?

210
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,410
- Hello, Ahjeossi.
 - Hi.

211
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,310
You've been well, right?

212
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,090
You must be surprised I suddenly reached out.

213
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,270
Not at all. Everything's good, right?

214
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,270
I'm doing well.

215
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,200
I heard you painted for Jae Won's company and helped her a lot.

216
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,570
Thank you, Yun Jin.

217
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,680
Ajeossi...

218
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,650
you haven't changed.

219
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,270
What made you call me, by the way?

220
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,900
I was just wondering...

221
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,410
I wanted to ask you something.

222
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,910
I was wondering if Jae Won or Sun Yeong were...

223
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,610
going through something I don't know about.

224
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm sorry, Ajeossi.

225
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,170
It's all my fault.

226
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,610
You?

227
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,740
What do you mean?

228
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,690
Father, what brings you here without notice—

229
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,300
How could you?

230
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,350
How could you do that with Jae Won's friend, of all people?

231
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,220
Have you been playing innocent next to

233
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,880
Jae Won after doing something so shameless?

234
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,310
You've been so good to her. Why did you do that?

235
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,310
Father, have some water.

236
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,090
Does Jae Won know, too?

237
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,640
She doesn't remember... yet.

238
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,470
What will you do from now on?

239
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,460
Since she found out she doesn't remember,

240
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,700
she's been very anxious.

241
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,740
Until she settles down and gets her memory back...

242
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,930
I want to stay by her side until then.

243
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,960
I'll ask for forgiveness after that.

244
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,660
What if she wants to break up then?

245
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,390
I'll...

246
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,470
have to do what she wants then.

247
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,300
I can't tell her.

248
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,370
I can tell she's barely holding on in the storm right now.

249
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,200
How could I possibly...

250
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,050
Sun Yeong.

251
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,370
Yes, Father.

252
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,060
Let's say it never happened.

253
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,330
Her memory might not come back.

254
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,180
She doesn't remember what happened when she was 15, either.

255
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,410
You don't want to lose her, either, right?

256
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,020
So...

257
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,270
let's cover it up and move on.

258
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,970
Knock, knock.

259
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,490
You haven't gone home yet?

260
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,500
Yeah, I needed to check something.

261
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,580
We have a meeting with J Department Store tomorrow.

262
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,120
Didn't they report to you?

263
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,730
I put together the sales report and presentation for the meeting and sent them along.

264
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,120
I received them. I wanted to check one more time.

265
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,000
It's an important client.

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,690
We can't make mistakes.

267
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,820
Let's look at them together, then.

268
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,990
Why would you?

269
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,240
Because it's an important client.

270
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,490
You don't have to.

271
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,970
Give that to me. Seriously.

272
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,880
I'll tell you everything, including what you don't remember.

273
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,670
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

274
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,910
I'm not sure what I've done exactly.

275
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,000
I just have no idea.

276
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,500
I even framed my husband for leaking our design to get custody.

277
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,810
What else couldn't I do?

278
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,830
You're already doing something terrible right now.

279
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,250
You're working overtime and making the employees feel guilty.

280
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,530
Just look at me right now.

281
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,370
This is a huge deal, okay?

282
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,410
I met Professor Heo recently.

283
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,340
Sun Yeong?

284
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,600
I don't know about anything else,

285
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,990
but it definitely seemed like he didn't want you to get hurt.

286
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,510
So, why don't you trust him and wait for him?

287
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,610
Thank you, Te Oh.

288
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,890
Should I stay with you or leave?

289
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,190
Go and do your thing.

290
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,690
Okay.

291
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,340
Mom!

292
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,570
Ah Rin!

293
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,520
What brings you here?

294
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,510
She kept begging to see you.

295
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,120
Did you want to come see me?

296
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,490
No. I said we can't because you're busy,

297
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,200
but Dad begged me to visit you together.

298
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,270
We were supposed to keep that a secret, Ah Rin.

299
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,210
Right. I forgot.

300
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,910
Goodness...

301
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,610
Mom, who's that ajeossi?

302
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,140
Why are you alone with him?

303
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,580
Hi, Ah Rin.

304
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,970
I discussed work with CEO Seo a bit.

305
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,850
I'll forgive you just once.

306
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,820
Thank you.

307
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,320
I'll get going now, then.

308
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,100
- Is this your desk?
 - Yes.

309
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,040
It's huge. I want to try sitting here.

310
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,870
Okay. Here we go.

311
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,410
Secretary Heo, what's next on my schedule?

312
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,190
What's next?

313
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,980
Okay. Let's see.

314
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,980
The next thing is for us to go get dinner.

315
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay, let's go eat.

316
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,500
♫  If I look at the sky that's moving further away  ♫

317
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,300
♫  I will leave without regret  ♫

318
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,410
♫  Our appearing like we had been together a long time  ♫

319
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,580
♫  will not seem any different ♫

320
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,870
That's right.

321
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,060
- You should eat, too.
 - Okay.

322
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,190
♫  Dreams will disappear  ♫

323
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,560
♫  The dreams without you will all disappear  ♫

324
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,080
Ah Rin, be careful.

325
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,060
♫  Light is still falling  ♫

326
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,060
♫  Even so I am fine  ♫

327
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm sad because she seems all grown up already.

328
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,480
I used work as an excuse and didn't do much for her.

329
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,140
She's still a baby. We still have a lot of time.

330
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,150
She needs to go to elementary school, middle school, and high school.

331
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,390
She'll be in puberty then, too.

332
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,380
We need to be prepared for when she hits puberty.

333
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,610
She might suddenly be like, "How would you guys know how I feel?

334
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,880
Don't come into my room!"

335
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,090
Stuff like that.

336
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,760
This is so nice.

337
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,990
I feel like we haven't had a conversation like this in a while.

338
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
It's nice.

339
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,900
I...

340
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,120
might've actually wanted...

341
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,360
you not to get your memory back.

342
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,900
Why?

343
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,790
Because I won't ever have this again.

344
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,130
You, me, and our Ah Rin.

345
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,460
The three of us spending time like this.

346
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,330
Honey, what's wrong?

347
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,040
I don't know. I suddenly...

348
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,680
suddenly feel so sad.

349
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,290
I don't know why I'm like this.

350
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,270
I feel strange.

351
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,640
- Honey.
 - Yes?

352
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,740
Let's do what you want to do.

353
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,440
If that's best for our family,

354
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,930
I think it's the right thing to do.

355
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,930
I'm okay.

356
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,740
This bastard is bad news.

357
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,870
He was charged with sexual assault a few years ago,

358
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,920
but he removed all the evidence,

359
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,290
threatened the victims, and made them withdraw the lawsuits.

360
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,280
He ended up being acquitted.

361
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,860
 Who are you, exactly?

362
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,030
 You know my father,

363
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,060
 but you seem to be involved with Seo Jae Won, too.

364
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,300
Aren't you going to let go?

365
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,020
I said you can't come in without an invitation.

366
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm a police officer, you bastards.

367
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,850
- You can't.
 - I said I'm here to see CEO Seo Jae Won.

368
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,270
Move.

369
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,640
Shit.

370
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,890
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,690
So, which room is Seo Jae Won in?

372
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,660
 Sun Yeong. Let's say it never happened.

373
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,440
 You don't want to lose her, either, right?

374
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,790
 So let's cover it up and move on.

375
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,230
 This is your method.

376
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,800
 You scrape everything and run away if you can't handle it.

377
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,780
 Don't run away. You won't be able to run from the truth.

378
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,300
 Jae Won.

379
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,510
Seo Jae Won.

380
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,660
You're the one who ruined everything.

381
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,260
It's all your fault, I said.

382
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,060
 Jae Won. Jae Won?

383
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,590
Jae Won?

384
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
Are you okay?

385
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,510
What? Did you have a nightmare?

386
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
What was it about?

387
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,470
Does your condition have to do with the nightmare, by chance?

388
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,320
It's not like that.

389
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,040
It was just a meaningless dream.

390
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,350
What time is it now?

391
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,390
I need to go to work early for a meeting.

392
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,330
When are you going to the hospital?

393
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,640
- Why?
 - I wanted to come with you.

394
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,130
I'm your guardian, you know.

395
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,150
I'm not going to the hospital.

396
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,140
A close friend of mine is a psychologist.

397
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,420
She's been counseling me at the hotel.

398
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,750
Mom! I'm late. I'm late.

399
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,650
Give me my toothbrush.

400
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,390
- Hurry, hurry.
 - Okay.

401
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,960
I can't get a compliment sticker if I'm tardy today, too.

402
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,440
Everyone is having a hard time.

403
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,100
You can't be sleeping like this.

404
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,590
Just know you've used up all your vacation time.

405
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,430
How far are we?

406
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,250
We'll arrive in five minutes.

407
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,090
CEO, do you need to do this interview?

408
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,650
It's not important. It's just to promote the foundation.

409
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,770
I have to.

410
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,220
Sometimes, you have to return a favor.

411
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,750
Welcome, CEO Seo.

412
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,770
We meet again, CEO Seo.

413
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,270
In the last interview, you said CEO Seo

414
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,090
was the most memorable scholarship student.

415
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,780
Yes. Do you still feel the same way?

416
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,850
Of course.

417
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm happy to see a seed I sowed contributing to society.

418
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,870
But it doesn't matter if they're successful or not.

419
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,170
Everyone is my precious student.

420
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,920
Wow, your mindset is different since you do important work.

421
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,860
How about you, CEO Seo?

422
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,880
This is just among us.

423
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,410
Derêve will benefit greatly if Chairman Kwon becomes a minister.

424
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,920
Looks like you're only interested in stuff like that.

425
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,470
Your questions are always the same.

426
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,770
It's more like I'm very interested in you.

427
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,310
By the way, you're okay now, right?

428
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,770
You seemed a bit off when I saw you in front of the store.

429
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,190
You acted like you didn't remember me.

430
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,890
What's he talking about right now?

431
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,870
You're mistaken.

432
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,090
That never happened.

433
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,490
Could you explain what happened at the cafe last time?

434
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,620
Are you not going to answer?

435
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,610
You didn't actually forget, did you?

436
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,070
How could I?

437
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:11,600
I dropped a glass and cut my hand a bit once.

438
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,300
You must know better since you met the employee

439
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,950
and took the CCTV footage.

440
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,760
Well, that's...

441
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,970
I didn't want useless false rumors to hurt you.

442
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,210
It wasn't even anything serious.

443
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,590
Let's finish the interview now.

444
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,190
 What do I do? What do I do? Wait...

445
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,600
 Let me get the first aid kit.

446
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,810
 Just a moment.

447
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,760
To whom should I take this to get an appropriate deal?

448
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,830
Geez...

449
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,780
The rich ones are worse.

450
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,850
This is why I can't quit doing this.

451
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,340
Unbelievable.

452
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,870
Wow.

453
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,990
What are you doing right now?

454
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,990
How dare you come to this place?

455
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,690
It's none of your business.

456
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,520
Do you still have feelings for me, by chance?

457
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,590
- What?
 - Just tell me if you're lonely at night.

458
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,260
I can do that much for you.

459
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,520
You're still the same.

460
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,750
You cheapen even the people around you talking like that.

461
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,510
I thought you liked it.

462
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,300
I was too naive then.

463
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,470
You were just a piece of trash.

464
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,940
Don't say anything unnecessary, and just leave quietly.

465
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,420
If you keep acting this way, it's not me

466
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,720
but the chairman you'll put in a difficult spot.

467
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,250
Okay?

468
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,260
Don't you have anything to tell me, Father?

469
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,700
Don't you know how to knock?

470
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,620
Why are you allowing someone like that in the foundation?

471
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,500
Since when? Shouldn't you have told me, at least?

472
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,740
You broke off your engagement a long time ago.

473
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,950
Why are you freaking out about something from the past?

474
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,230
Something from the past?

475
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,280
Is it just something from the past to you?

476
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,420
You're well aware of what that bastard did to me.

477
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,680
That is your problem.

478
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,970
Why are you dragging personal feelings into business?

479
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,670
You can't do anything with such a narrow mind.

480
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,240
What do you mean?

481
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,630
How great of a business are you running, exactly?

482
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,410
Did he promise to turn you into a minister or something?

483
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,590
Who's turning whom into what?

484
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,070
Stop talking nonsense, and get out of here.

485
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:44,970

486
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,920
Who said you can come in here?

487
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,420
I did.

488
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,430
Or CEO Seo did.

489
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,460
Come on.

490
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,470
Are you okay in front of all the employees?

491
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,700
Mr. Nam.

492
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,350
- Come on in.
 - Okay.

493
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,540
Have you been well, CEO Seo?

494
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,210
What's this about?

495
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,130
I was curious if things went well last time

496
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,550
and I wanted to ask you if you needed my help, too.

497
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,090
I'm not sure if you remember,

498
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,650
but you asked me to do research on your husband.

499
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,520
I have his call and transaction records here.

500
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,980
I assume you found something very important here.

501
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,090
Aren't you interested?

502
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,970
What's your angle?

503
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,860
Why did you come all the way here to give that to me?

504
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,270
I don't have such a thing.

505
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:22,190
I just have what you want, and this is kind of worth a lot.

506
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,500
I was just wondering if you're interested in buying it.

507
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,810
I don't need it.

508
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,620
Okay. Call me if you become interested.

509
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,950
I'm professional when it comes to deals.

510
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,070
By the way.

511
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,840
I don't think there is anyone around you who will tell you the truth right now.

512
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,070
I'm sure there isn't.

513
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,050
 DNA Test Result

514
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,140
 DNA Test Result

515
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,540
 99.999% probability that they are related.

516
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,500
 Subject A (Father) and Subject C (Female) are related]

517
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,130
 XB Medical

518
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,150
Wait!

519
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,460
I'm in the elevator right now.

520
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,390
It worked amazingly.

521
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,710
It's really potent stuff.

522
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,220
It totally erases memory if you give them alcohol, too.

523
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,430
Geez. Stop worrying.

524
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,070
You think I'm a newbie? I've done this plenty of times.

525
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,740
Do you want me to get you some?

526
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,240
Seriously. I've done it. I saw it, okay?

527
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,410
I'm Kim Sang Beom, okay?

528
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,810
I said it works amazingly well.

529
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,610
You wouldn't say that if you saw it in person—

530
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,510
Geez. Why are you acting like an amateur?

531
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,350
Excuse me. Hold on.

532
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,840
You can't come in here.

533
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,550
- Excuse me.
 - Who are you?

534
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,920
What? Who the hell are you—

535
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,980
Tell me. Tell me!

536
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,140
Wh-What? Who are you?

537
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,010
Why did you do that to her?

538
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,170
- Let go!
 - Call the police.

539
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,620
Tell me!

540
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,170
Tell me!

541
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,090
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me, you bastard.

542
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,570
Tell me!

543
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,340
Honey.

544
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,090
Honey?

545
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,790
Honey—

546
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,760
Where did you go without saying anything?

547
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,130
Did something happen?

548
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,490
What happened? Are you hurt? Did you fall?

549
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,740
Jae Won.

550
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,840
Let's go out on a date.

551
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,650
Okay.

552
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,730
Do you remember when we were in school?

553
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,720
We practically used to live in that building.

554
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,440
How could I forget that?

555
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,780
Excuse me. Student.

556
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,100
What are you doing here right now?

557
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,900
You're not a student.

558
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,460
Non-students aren't allowed in here.

559
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,290
The professor said I could.

560
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,960
I suppose he felt sorry for his student who quit her job to start a company.

561
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,700
He said I can use the studio when it's empty.

562
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,300
I see...

563
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,410
We'll be seeing each other often, then.

564
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,740
Don't make moves on me. I have a boyfriend.

565
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,980
What a shame.

566
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,610
But I kind of expected that.

567
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,120
Since you're so pretty,

568
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,780
I'm sure your boyfriend is very handsome, too.

569
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,370
No.

570
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,880
How come you haven't left yet?

571
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,740
I have a lot to prepare for the class tomorrow.

572
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,520
You're hardworking. You'd really end up a professor at this rate.

573
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,030
I know. It better happen soon. Why is it so difficult?

574
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,150
They won't release the test result.

575
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,120
You worked hard on it.

576
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,650
I'm sure you'll make it this time.

577
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,040
I'll take care of you even if you don't. Don't worry.

578
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,210
Don't worry.

579
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,910
- Really?
 - Yes.

580
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,070
You're so freaking cool.

581
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,210
But you're unemployed.

582
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,600
Call me a future CEO, not unemployed, please.

583
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,140
Okay.

584
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,900
 Hanyang Brazier

585
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,320
Wow. I can't believe this.

586
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,100
People usually line up to get in here.

587
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,330
This is a famous place.

588
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,730
Meat tastes better with charcoal.

589
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,420
It's good, right?

590
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,460
It's so good.

591
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,760
Wow, it's so juicy.

592
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,510
Cheers.

593
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,440
- Cheers.
 - Cheers.

594
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,940
I have something I want to do.

595
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,830
What is it?

596
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,950
I want to study a bit more abroad if I get a chance.

597
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,730
And I want to work on a public art project with students' work.

598
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,950
And I want to create an art village.

599
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,170
I'll create a huge art village

600
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,640
and let the public enjoy various kinds of art and culture.

601
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,790
What do you think?

602
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,240
When will you do all of those things?

603
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,180
Don't worry about stuff like that. I just need to do it slowly and surely.

604
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,190
With you.

605
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,690
- With me?
 - Yes.

606
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,180
Okay.

607
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,660
You promised, okay?

608
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,280
Of course.

609
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,220
It's so good.

610
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,310
I'm sorry, Honey.

611
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,500
To be honest, I know

612
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,620
how many opportunities

613
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,460
you've rejected because of how busy I am.

614
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,180
I knew how important work was to you,

615
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,980
but I only let you live as Seo Jae Won's husband and Ah Rin's dad.

616
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,950
I'm so sorry.

617
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,350
Don't be. It was my choice.

618
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,980
I knew everything, but I chose it myself.

619
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,720
To me, you and Ah Rin are way more important than work.

620
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,480
At some point,

621
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,720
I stopped trusting you,

622
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,730
and I made an irreparable decision.

623
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,160
I should've trusted you until the end.

624
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,700
But I couldn't.

625
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,340
I'm sorry.

626
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,060
I'm sorry.

627
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,750
Why do you keep apologizing?

628
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,100
Why are you suffering instead of talking to me about it?

629
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:02,490
Sun Yeong, no matter what happened in the past

630
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,490
and if I'm ready to face it,

631
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,100
it's okay to tell me. Don't you think?

632
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,220
 What if Ah Rin remembers me

633
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,310
 as a bad mom?

634
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,610
 My Ah Rin...

635
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,150
Can you not tell me because of Ah Rin, by chance?

636
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,050
- What?
 - If I find out,

637
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,340
can we lose Ah Rin?

638
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,580
No, it's not like that.

639
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,750
Why would we lose Ah Rin?

640
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,540
She's our daughter.

641
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,210
She's yours and mine.

642
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,480
Jae Won, I know you're confused and frustrated right now.

643
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,750
I do, but could you hang in there a bit

644
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,340
and trust my decision just this once?

645
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,250
I'll make sure our family doesn't get hurt because of the past.

646
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,470
Please?

647
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,810
 How could you...

648
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,140
 How could you? How could you do this to me?

649
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,520
 - Sun Yeong, here...
 - Let go.

650
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,740
 Let go!

651
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,610
 Do you think I'd believe that?

652
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,590
Are you going to work already?

653
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,220
Yes.

654
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,730
I wanted to go early because I have a lot of important meetings today.

655
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,810
Why did you get up so early?

656
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,850
I just couldn't sleep.

657
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,090
I'll see you later.

658
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,770
Jae Won.

659
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,130
Yes?

660
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,170
Everything will be okay. So don't worry and go.

661
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,440
See you.

662
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,610
Do you still need to tell me something?

663
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,450
You knew everything from the beginning, didn't you?

664
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,290
About what happened seven years ago.

665
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,530
Yes.

666
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,140
You found out about everything now, too.

667
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,090
About the terrible thing Seo Jae Won did.

668
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,940
You knew everything, but...

669
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,360
how could you do that?

670
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,700
You knew Jae Won was sick, too.

671
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,050
You knew that wasn't her intention, either.

672
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,260
What are you trying to do right now?

673
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,340
Are you here to make an excuse for Seo Jae Won?

674
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,420
That she couldn't help it because of the drugs and she drank too much?

675
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,560
Do you think that's good enough of an excuse?

676
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,250
I'm the one who lost everything because of that day, not Seo Jae Won.

677
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,740
I'm the one who's been in pain for the past seven years!

678
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,100
- Yun Jin.
 - Do you think

679
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,620
this would get us back to how we were?

680
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,310
No.

681
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:43,410
You two were already over long ago, even if it weren't for me.

682
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,200
You can't go back to the past, even if you try to hide it.

683
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,740
Your thin strand of hope...

684
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,230
I'll destroy it for you.

685
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,020
What are you doing?

686
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,020
What are you doing right now?

687
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,520
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm so sorry.

689
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,350
I wasn't thinking clearly.

690
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,580
It's all my fault.

691
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,040
Please forgive me just once.

692
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,960
Forgive me just once so I could protect my family.

693
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,680
I'm sorry, Yun Jin.

694
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,980
Are you...

695
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,650
kneeling in front of me because of Seo Jae Won?

696
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,670
Do you want to see me going insane?

697
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,430
Do you really?

698
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:15,600
Do you think you could be forgiven for what you did by doing this?

699
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,820
Do you think you two could become happy like this?

700
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,860
No.

701
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,150
You can't.

702
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,240
If I can't have it,

703
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,900
no one can.

704
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,980
 You endured me? You?

705
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,570
 - Let's get divorced.
 - He could end up

706
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,370
 - You know, right, Jae Won?
 - getting custody, too.

707
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,850
 You're the only one I have.

708
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,400
 You're in here, aren't you? Come out!

709
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,000
 I never thought she wouldn't be yours.

710
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,940
 I know what Ah Rin means to you.

711
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,180
 It must be my fault since I'm inferior to you.

712
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,330
 I want to kill them both.

713
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,970
 Let go. Let go!

714
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,980
 Watch what happens when you mess with my daughter.

715
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,890
 http://dorimnim-bio.co.kr
 Don't forget what you did that day.

716
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,080
 Don't forget what you did that day

717
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,710
 Subject A and C are not a match.

718
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,450
 I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

719
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,940
 I really didn't know.

720
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,320
 I never even imagined it in my dreams.

721
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,970
 I never thought she wouldn't be yours—

722
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,540
 My...

723
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,290
 entire world was destroyed because of you.

724
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,870
 My Ah Rin...

725
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,920
 Please raise her well.

726
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,390
 I didn't even know you were ill.

727
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,040
 I should've trusted you until the end.

728
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,400
 What have I been doing by myself?

729
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,570
 But I couldn't.

730
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,320
 I'm sorry.

731
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,840
 Are you sure you won't regret saying that

732
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,450
 when you get your memory back?

733
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,600
 Secretary Kim

734

735
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,170
 105 missed calls. 87 text messages

736
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,540
- Who's this—
 - Ms. Seo Jae Won.

737
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,040
Hold her.

738
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,720
You're under arrest for the murder of Heo Sun Yeong.

739
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:45,560
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

740
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,860
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

 My Happy Ending

753
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,970
 A highly poisonous pesticide was found in the water bottle Mr. Heo used.

754
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:03,200
 And there's a record of Ms. Seo purchasing the pesticide with the same ingredients.

755
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,890
 She must be hiding something.

756
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,330
 It might have to do with you being framed, too.

757
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,420
 Heo Sun Yeong's phone is missing from the list of belongings.

758
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,080
 Sun Yeong left this with me.

759
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,790
 She's resigning as a CEO.

760
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,280
 You need to save the company, though.

761
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,460
 Jae Won! Jae Won!

762
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,420
 You've always been next to me.

763
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,720
 You killed Sun Yeong, didn't you?

764
