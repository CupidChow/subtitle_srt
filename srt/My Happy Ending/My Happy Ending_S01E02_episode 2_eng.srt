10
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,600
Gosh, when did you prepare all this?

11
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,330
Just wait a bit.

12
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,050
Breakfast is almost ready.

13
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,480
I feel terrible.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,230
I need to get going now.

15
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,230
Already? Why?

16
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm sorry. Let's say I ate it.

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,990
Seriously.

18
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,760
All right.

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,420
Call me later instead.

20
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,820
Okay.

 My Happy Ending

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,340
Honey.

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,210
Honey, are you okay?

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,620
Jae Won. Jae Won.

25
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,820
Excuse me! Doctor!

26
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,620
Excuse me!

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,300
 Episode 2

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,580
Although it will be temporary,

29
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,510
resting is a priority since she was in a serious accident.

30
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,840
She will have severe pain because her ribs are fractured.

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,100
Moving too much might cause a corollary condition. She should be lying down for a while.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,760
I understand.

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,580
By the way, you're sure she's okay, right?

34
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,780
You don't have to worry.

35
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,800
Thank you.

36
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,850
Geez.

37
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,650
While you were unconscious in the critical care unit,

38
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,950
Father stayed here the whole time.

39
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,130
He wouldn't sleep or eat.

40
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,450
What? You should stay in bed.

41
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,610
I'm thirsty.

42
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,230
Thirsty? Hold on.

43
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,940
Here.

44
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,220
The police stopped by in the morning.

45
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,530
Jae Won, tell me now.

46
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,910
What exactly happened?

47
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,930
 What?

48
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,330
 You know, right, Jae Won?

49
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,010
 You're the only one I have.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,960
Nothing happened.

51
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,650
I just got drunk and made a mistake.

52
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,690
Why would you say such nonsense?

53
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,130
Yes.

54
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,450
The doctor wants to see Ms. Seo Jae Won's guardian.

55
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,890
Okay.

56
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,920
I'll be right back.

57
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,280
 Derêve

58
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,370
 Hello, Director.

59
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,090
It's ready in the conference room, sir.

60
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,200
We're preventing speculative reports as much as possible.

61
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,070
The police will release the investigation results soon.
  Derêve announces the CEO's fall was just an accident.

62
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,670
I'm assuming it won't have any direct effect.

63
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,750
- And for the last quarter's sales report—
 - Okay.

64
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,790
I'll hear it from CEO Seo in person later.

65
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,490
I understand.

66
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,790
 Derêve 
 Casamia

67
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,090
Wait for me outside.

68
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,870
- Is there something wrong—
 - Geez.

69
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,440
You came.

70
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,050
Is this what you've been working on day and night?

71
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,320
I can manage my own business.

72
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,580
Did I pay for your education abroad for you to do useless stuff like this?

73
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,440
What would be so great about having an exhibit using your name?

74
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,910
I got this job because they acknowledged my talent.

75
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,220
You must be happy.

76
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,160
You were acknowledged by your friend of 20 years.

77
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,310
 The accident occurred somewhere remote without many pedestrians.

78
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,620
 There weren't any CCTVs for that reason.

79
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,740
 A man in his 50s notified the police.

80
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,260
 He testified that he only saw something falling and nothing else.

81
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,470
 It'll be difficult to find more witnesses since it was late at night.

82
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,880
How about the reporters?

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,380
I clearly told them it was just an accident.

84
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,910
We can't allow any speculative reports.

85
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,570
Okay.

86
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,960
What was on my schedule today?

87
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,980
A styling meeting for a showroom that's planned to open next month,

88
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,080
the finance team's sales report, and a concept meeting for the website renewal.

89
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,130
Tell Director Park to attend the styling meeting.

90
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,980
Tell them to send the sales report home in the evening.

91
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,660
And we'll have the concept meeting here in an hour.

92
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,750
I'll come into the office as usual starting tomorrow.

93
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,890
- Tomorrow?
 - Get ready.

94
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,970
I heard you needed to be hospitalized for a few more days.

95
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,000
Says who?

96
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,200
Stop what you're doing and come here.

97
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,130
Okay. I'm all done.

98
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,030
Cheers.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
This is so nice.

100
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,220
It is.

101
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,570
Look at that kid.

102
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,130
If we had met a little sooner,

103
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,900
we'd have a child around that age, don't you think?

104
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,590
If only we had met...

105
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,350
about seven years sooner.

106
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm not sure.

107
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,980
You're so bad at reading the mood.

108
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,460
Is that it?

109
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,790
Can't you say, "It's not too late"? Something like that?

110
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,550
I'm talking about our marriage and our child.

111
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,610
I didn't want to say this because it'd be petty, but—

112
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,600
Hold on.

113
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
- Who is it?
 - It's for work.

114
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,590
Sorry. I'll make a short phone call.

115
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,590
Are you sure you'll be okay going to work today?

116
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,050
Yes.

117
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,790
Jae Won, you should just rest today.

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,170
You scared me.

119
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,650
Yes, I'm sorry.

120
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,010
Are you okay?

121
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,650
I'm okay.

122
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,830
How many times did I tell you?

123
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,730
I'm fine.

124
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,320
Good morning.

125
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,020
- Hey, you came.
 - Hi.

126
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,850
That's so crazy.

127
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,000
I didn't think she'd come to work for a while.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,310
Hey. They don't call her a workaholic for no reason.

129
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,330
You'd be shocked if you knew her daily schedule.

130
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,020
She doesn't take a break from morning until night.

131
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,440
I heard that she worked in the waiting room on her wedding day. Is that true?

132
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,510
I saw it myself.

133
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,800
Good morning.

134
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,340
Hello, sir.

135
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,200
- You came.
 - Hello.

136
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,890
- Hello.
 - Hello.

137
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,590
Aigoo. Please give this to CEO Seo.

138
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,810
Would you like to see her?

139
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,870
It's okay. Thank you.

140
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,720
Sure.

141
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,010
Jae Won.

142
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,480
Do you know how worried I was?

143
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,060
You must be still in a lot of pain.

145
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,770
Yes. I am.

146
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,900
What happened?

147
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,470
Didn't you see the articles?

148
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,300
I did, but—

149
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,070
It's exactly as they say.

150
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Do you need to tell me something?

151
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,370
It...

152
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,530
must've been very difficult.

153
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,940
It was.

154
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,730
Very much so.

155
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,440
 - Yes, CEO. 
 - Bring me the documents to sign off.

156
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,970
I'll leave you to it, then.

157
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,840
Let me know anytime if you need me.

158
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,570
I'll get going.

159
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,030
- CEO.
 - Yeah?

160
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,100
Your father brought this for you.

161
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,250
- Father did?
 - Yes.

162
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,560
He left it with a security guard early this morning.

163
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay.

164
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,640
 Your mother had visited the ER three times for taking pesticide before she passed.

165
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,130
 And Mr. Seo accompanied her each time.

166
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,740
 Unless it was on purpose or someone gave it to her,

167
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,710
 it's not easy to drink it by mistake three times.

168
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,180
 Don't you think?

169
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,320
 CEO SEO JAE WON

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,000
 My Dad

171
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,350
 Icheon Platform 8

172
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,900
Hey. Did you get the thermos?

173
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,520
 Yes.

174
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,590
It's beef bone soup.

175
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,820
I heard it's good for bones. I put beef leg bone, feet, knee cartilage,

176
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,670
and all sorts of things and cooked it all night.

177
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,250
You shouldn't have. I can just get it at a restaurant.

178
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,750
 Aigoo. How could that be better than homemade?

179
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,000
Make sure to eat it.

180
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,240
This is the only thing I can do for you, Jae Won.

181
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,460
When did you come to the office?

182
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,230
 I stopped by early so I wouldn't interrupt your work..

183
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,110
 Don't worry about it.

184
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,380
Dad.

185
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,090
 Yes?

186
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,070
Thanks for the soup.

187
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,340
Let me know anytime if you want more.

188
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,400
Okay. You must be busy. I'll let you go. Take care.

189
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,250
This is Seo Jae Won.

190
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,830
I'd like to see you today.

191
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,910
I'll tell you later in person.

192
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,280
Okay.

193
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,230
See you there.

194
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,080
Stay there.

195
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,270
I'll talk to you from here.

196
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,410
How's it going?

197
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,190
Are you hanging in there?

198
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,160
I don't know what you're mistaken about,

199
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,720
but please rethink it.

200
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,940
Or give me a chance to explain myself, at least.

201
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,700
Why do I have to do that?

202
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Because of all the time we've spent together.

203
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,190
I don't need to hear your explanation.

204
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,770
What now, then?

205
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,820
Wait...

206
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,390
until I form a judgment.

207
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,530
How will you judge me?

208
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,810
You don't know that much about me.

209
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,630
Wow, I didn't see this coming.

210
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,020
I gave you my business card, but I didn't think you'd call me first.

211
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,680
I'd like to propose something to you.

212
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,960
That's even more unexpected.

213
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,090
- What is it?
 - But first,

214
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,160
there's something I need to address with you.

215
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,090
Once you become a CEO of a sizeable company,

216
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,090
you don't just make a lot of money. You make connections in many fields.

217
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,360
So, I did look you up.

218
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,490
Why are you stirring up what happened in the past now?

219
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,590
That's because...

220
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,010
well...

221
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,860
I'm curious what you found out.

222
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,890
That you were a former homicide detective.

223
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,200
You quit while being investigated for taking a bribe.

224
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,780
And you suspiciously got acquitted sometime after.

225
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,000
Wow, you really know everything.

226
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,950
But why were you in the dark about your own family, then?

227
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,500
I'll also start looking into that now.

228
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,940
Without missing anything at all.

229
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,670
How about your proposal to me?

230
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,100
Keep doing what you're doing.

231
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,170
I want you to investigate how my mom died.

232
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,690
But do it for me, not for the insurance company.

233
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,370
Why do I have to do that?

234
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,430
There's no way you quit your government job to become a salaryman.

235
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,280
Are you satisfied with your current pay?

236
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,330
I'll supplement it if it's not enough.

237
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,850
More than enough to satisfy you, Mr. Nam Tae Ju.

238
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,250
 Yein Arts Scholarship Foundation

239
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,940
Hello, CEO.

240
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,240
Where's Ah Rin?

241
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,490
She had a bit of a fever. So she took medicine and went to bed early.

242
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,330
And Professor Heo stepped out for a second.

243
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,750
She had a fever?

244
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,290
Yes.

245
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,300
When did you come?

246
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,410
Just now.

247
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,030
I'm sorry. I woke you up, didn't I?

248
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,870
You're not busy today?

249
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,670
No. I'm not busy anymore.

250
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,250
Let's sleep together, then.

251
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,040
Okay.

252
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,000
Should we sleep together, Princess?

253
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,490
Okay.

254
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,690
 Yes. CEO.

255
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,540
Is Ms. Kwon working right now?

256
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,330
 Just one moment.

257
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,490
Yes, she's working. Should I put her on the phone?

258
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,520
No, it's okay.

259
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,800
You came home early.

260
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,880
Where have you been?

261
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,840
I was at the gym, you know.

262
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,070
I felt sluggish since I skipped a few days.

263
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,610
Yes, I'm sure.

264
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,940
Oh, right. How are you feeling?

265
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,770
Did you remember to take your medicine?

266
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,640
Gosh, you need to rest longer. I was worried.

267
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,420
You're worried about me?

268
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,040
Of course, I am.

269
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,300
I'll go take a shower.

270
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,830
Are you really worried about me?

271
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,270
Huh?

272
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,590
Why did you do that to me, then?

273
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,600
 He's no longer a member here.

274
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,470
 He stopped coming about three months ago.

275
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,360
That day...

276
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,650
I did go to the gym.

277
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,270
Well, I switched to a different gym. It's upstairs in the same building.

278
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,740
It turns out my high school classmate runs it.

279
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,930
How about the text, then?

280
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,710
 I'm arriving soon.

281
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,540
The text...

282
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,710
The same friend sent that.

283
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,520
We planned to work out together that day.

284
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,070
But I'm still not used to using this.

285
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,590
So, it got deleted by accident.

286
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,040
I'm sorry that I caused a misunderstanding.

287
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,180
By chance, your brother—

288
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,460
My brother? What about him, all of a sudden?

289
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
It's nothing.

290
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,970
Never mind. It's nothing. Let's stop.

291
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,850
Jae Won.

292
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,450
Jae Won.

293
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,920
I'm so sorry.

294
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,680
I was too inattentive. I didn't even know you were thinking that.

295
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,830
You must've felt terrible, both physically and emotionally.

296
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,070
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,350
Forgive me just once.

298
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,860
I'll do better.

299
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,300
Okay?

300
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,930
 This is Team Leader Yun Te Oh's personnel file which you requested.

301
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,300
How about what I mentioned before?

302
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,510
Team Leader Yun was apparently at a club on the night of the 15th.

303
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,570
Are you sure?

304
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,730
Yes. A few of the employees saw him.

305
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,080
 He joined the company four years ago.

306
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,950
 He joined the company four years ago.

307
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,340
 You don't know that much about me.

308
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,760
 Thank you, my daughter.

309
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,460
 Forgive me just once. I'll do better.

310
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,600
 Why did you do that to me, then?

311
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,070
 Mirim Milk

312
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,040
 What?

313
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
 What's wrong?

314
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,620
Flower therapy. Have you heard of it?

315
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,580
According to a study, the scent of flowers reduces stress and depressing feelings.

316
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,370
You heal just by smelling. Isn't it amazing?

317
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,070
It is.

318
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,670
I can't ask if you've been well.

319
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,590
I saw the articles.

320
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,340
Could you get me some tea?

321
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
How about the stalker?

322
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,260
Are you sure that's Yun Te Oh?

323
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,570
I'm not sure about that, either.

324
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,510
The stalking began over seven years ago.

325
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,900
But Te Oh first came to Korea four years ago.

326
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,730
It doesn't make sense

327
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,070
that he started stalking me in the US seven years ago

328
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,020
when he didn't even know me.

329
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,700
You're right.

330
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,770
What are you going to do now?

331
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,500
 Where are you?

332
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,150
 I'll be late. Don't wait up for me.

333
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,060
 What are you going to do now?

334
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,770
 Are you afraid to face the truth?

335
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,800
 This isn't the first time that someone you trusted did something...

336
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,370
 Why me again?

337
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,770
 I believed I finally became happy.

338
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,450
 Why me again?

339
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,140
 I'm afraid.

340
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,560
 I'm afraid everything will crumble.

341
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,040
 For headache

342
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,850
 Derêve Security

343
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,300
 9:20 a.m. / Missed calls

344

345
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,180
 88 Pa 0505

346
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,580
CEO.

347
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,890
You couldn't be reached,

348
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,360
so Team Leader Yun joined the meeting instead.

349
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,590
He told the people from the Seoul Hotel that he'd like to

350
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,780
present the furniture design for the hotel first.

351
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,440
But the design isn't ready yet.

352
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
I suppose he prepared something.

353
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,430
Okay. Good job.

354
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,610
It wasn't me.

355
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,220
 SECURITY

356
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,190
This car is registered to the design team.

357
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,540
I understand the team members take turns using it.

358
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,370
Is there something wrong?

359
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,000
It's nothing. You can get back to work.

360
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,850
 How will you judge me?

361
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,740
 You don't know that much about me.

362
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,570
 The door is opening.

363
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,330
 Derêve

364
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,580
 The door is closing.

365
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,360
 The door is opening.

366
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,050
 The door is closing.

367
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,670
Get in.

368
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,750
 The door is closing.

369
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,570
You came in so early.

370
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,500
How did the meeting go?

371
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,300
You know there is an order in conversations.

372
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,110
I don't think you should say that first.

373
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Thank you for attending the meeting for me.

374
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,480
Are you no longer suspicious of me?

375
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,210
What are you worried about, exactly?

376
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,850
It really wasn't you?

377
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,470
Seriously! The more I think, the angrier I get.

378
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,040
Are you saying you doubted me?

379
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,690
When the office was upside down because of the stalker,

380
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,840
I was having fried chicken and beer with Rachel.

381
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,660
Look at this. The date and time.

382
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,260
I even took care of introducing the new product, too.

383
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,510
This isn't right.

384
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,400
Wait, how could you—

385
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,290
I'm so sorry.

386
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,490
Then, do me a favor.

387
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,750
- What?
 - Clear your schedule this afternoon first.

388
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,220
- I have so much to do today— 
- Well...

389
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,360
Okay.

390
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,280
Come on in.

391
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
You've never been to my workshop, right?

392
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,630
What's all this?

393
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,870
I felt like I was forgetting my true self since I'm only making furniture these days.

394
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,950
You were making a canvas.

395
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,760
Are you preparing for a show?

396
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,770
I'm thinking about it.

397
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,580
But why am I here?

398
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,430
Put this on first.

399
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:44,920

400
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,180
♫  I really want to stay in your mind  ♫

401
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,440
♫  In a small space  ♫

402
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,760
♫  Wherever it might be  ♫

403
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,730
♫  And you feel alone, even if you fall  ♫

404
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,760
♫  If you feel there's no way  ♫

405
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,730
♫  You take a rest  ♫

406
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,420
♫  Like the spring which bloomed after winter  ♫

407
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,600
Please hold it down properly. 
 ♫  Like the star path in the dark sky  ♫

408
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,500
♫  I promise you  ♫

409
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,210
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

410
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,410
♫  If you cry, I'll make you smile  ♫

411
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,320
Pull tightly over there.

412
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,790
Like this?

413
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,370
No, just pull the canvas.

414
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,500
While holding the frame so it doesn't move.

415
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,090
Gosh, seriously.

416
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,460
You complain even when I'm helping.

417
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,090
I can tell this isn't your first time.

418
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,180
I have tons of experience, okay?

419
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,860
I made canvases for everyone in my department when I was in college.

420
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,510
You would've become a successful artist if you used that time on painting instead.

421
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,630
I disagree with that.

422
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,390
I enjoyed painting, but I had no talent.

423
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,720
You can't say you had no talent if you got into Hanguk University.

424
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,050
Why are you making this yourself, by the way?

425
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,530
Are you doing this on purpose?

426
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,980
You know well.

427
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,030
Simple labor is best at getting rid of idle thoughts.

428
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,650
Look at you. You looked so depressed before.

429
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,280
You're finally yourself now.

430
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,640
Would you like some coffee?

431
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,330
Yes.

432
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,950
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

433
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,470
♫  If you cry, I'll make you smile  ♫

434
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,840
♫  Look at me one more time  ♫

435
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,520
♫  You can just lean on me  ♫

436
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,060
♫  Even if you leave me now  ♫

437
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:14,350
♫  I'll always be waiting for you here  ♫

438
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,830
♫  The rest of my life  ♫

439
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,870
Hello, CEO.

440
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,860
Secretary Heo, what's my schedule today?

441
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,940
Yes, Ma'am. You're going to kindergarten, have snacks,

442
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,370
and you planned to ride swings with Seo Jun in the afternoon.

443
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,700
Gosh, I'm so tired.

444
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,510
If you're tired, should I cancel something?

445
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,900
No.

446
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,460
I got the kindergarten bus waiting outside. Let's go.

447
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,290
Shall we?

448
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,010
I'm working late tonight. Don't wait up for me.

449
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,940
Good day.

450
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,240
I'll drop her off.

451
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,050
Let me open it for you, CEO.

452
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,770
Aigoo.

453
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,420
You're so impatient.

454
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,140
 My Dad

455
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,790
- Dad.
 - Huh?

456
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,200
Gosh, Jae Won.

457
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,600
What are you doing here?

458
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,550
I came to give you side dishes.

459
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,680
How about the medicine?

460
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,330
It makes me drowsy.

461
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,190
I feel nauseated, too.

462
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,820
It'll be fine once you get used to it.

463
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,920
How long do I have to take the medicine?

464
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,340
Well, until you're completely cured.

465
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,310
There isn't a wound to heal. How would you know if I'm cured?

466
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,010
Study hard and...

467
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,400
don't cause trouble because your parents will be worried.

468
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,240
You'll be cured, then.

469
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,080
 Psychiatrist's Office 1

470
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,520
 Just once more.

471
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,960
Gosh.

472
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,720
You should've called in advance. I'm sure no one's home now.

473
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,700
I was going to drop them off and leave so I wouldn't bother you at work.

474
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,500
It's okay. I didn't get rained on much.

475
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,870
You can drop me off at the station nearby.

476
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,220
I'll tell the driver. Let him drive you all the way home.

477
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,140
No, no. It's a short bus ride away.

478
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,370
Please listen to me. Stop making me worry.

479
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,860
Okay.

480
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,710
Jae Won.

481
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,020
You're okay now, right?

482
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,640
Nothing's going on, right?

483
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,700
 Seoul Immigration Office

484
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,370
I'll get punished if I get caught with this.

485
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,260
I played ignorant

486
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,320
about your wife pretending to be sick for over three months.

487
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,900
I was willing to be punished for it.

488
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,870

 My Husband

490
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,880
 Let's have dinner together tonight.

491
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,350
 I need to tell you something.

492
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,840
 There's something I want to hear from you, too.

493
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:03,100
CEO, here's a contract for joining J Department Store.

494
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,430
What time is the meeting today?

495
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,800
At 3 pm. You need to leave now.

496
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,330
You don't have to get the car ready. I'll take my car.

497
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,770
Okay.

498
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,400
- Yes, this is Seo Jae Won. 
- Regarding what you mentioned last time.

499
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,150
You wanted to find out about Yun Te Oh's immigration records, right?

500
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,920
I already confirmed it. You don't have to look into it.

501
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,840
I already did. What should I do?

502
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,260
He was adopted by a US family as a kid

503
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,030
and he came to Korea four years ago. Is that right?

504
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,760
 That's right.

505
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,360
 But it wasn't his first time four years ago.

506
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,100
 There's a record of him entering the country seven years ago, too.

507
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:02,530
 Derêve Design Team 
 Team Leader Yun Te Oh

508
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,690
I heard you're going to Korea after the show ends.

509
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,130
Will it be your first time in Korea, then?

510
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,160
I guess you can say that.

511
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,590
I've never been back since I was adopted when I was eight.

512
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,630
My father died due to illness when I was six

513
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,620
and my mother died from a car accident when I was seven.

514
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,230
Older boys don't get adopted easily in Korea.

515
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,520
That's how I ended up in the US.

516
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,990
It's not interesting for you?

517
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,380
Everyone's more curious about my past than my work.

518
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,230
- Yes, Ma'am.
  - Ms. Seo.

519
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,230
 I told Professor Heo that I needed to leave early today

520
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,450
 due to a situation at home.

521
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,340
 But I can't seem to reach him.

522
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,600
Is Ah Rin back?

523
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,990
 Not yet.

524
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,620
 Professor Heo always picks her up at three when she's finished kindergarten.

525
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,560
 I'm not sure if he went to pick her up.

526
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,770
Okay. You can leave.

527
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,530
 My Husband

528
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,650
 The door is opening.

529
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,960
 Yes, Ms. Seo.

530
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,840
Can we delay the meeting by an hour?

531
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,850
That was Ah Rin's dad.

532
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,270
 Class Flower Petal 3

533
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,080
One.

534
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,930
- Ah Rin's mother.
 - Hello, Ma'am.

535
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,970
Did my husband pick Ah Rin up?

536
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:20,750
Pardon? Ah Rin didn't come today because she's sick.

537
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,700
Didn't you know?

538
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,270
Oh, right...

539
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,400
 My Husband

540
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,850
Ah Rin!

541
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,980
Ah Rin...

542
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,050
Ah Rin!

543
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,610
Ah Rin!

544
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,940
Ah Rin!

545
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,040
Ah Rin!

546
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,900
 My Husband

547
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,670
Hello.

548
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,910
Hello, Ms. Seo.

549
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,520
Well, have you seen either my husband or daughter today?

550
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,020
I saw them on the way to lunch earlier.

551
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,310
- Around lunchtime?
 - Yes.

552
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,240
They were going somewhere looking happy.

553
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,140
Is something going on?

554
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,300
By the way,

555
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,950
he was with some woman earlier.

556
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,160
I don't think she lives in the neighborhood.

557
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,990
But she seemed close to Professor Heo.

558
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,090
 Yes, CEO.

559
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,440
Is Ms. Kwon in the office right now?

560
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,320
 Just one second.

561
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,840
No, she's not here.

562
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,640
 Front Door: Call / Save Picture / End / Open the door

563
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,320
 Ah Rin. Ah Rin.

564
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,540
Ah Rin, Mom's here.

565
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,380
I know you two are in there.

566
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,210
Come out.

567
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,680
Come out!

568
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,750
Open the door! Open it!

569
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,690
Come out!

570
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,210
Come out!

571
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,150
Come out!

572
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,350
Oh, Honey.

573
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,010
Why couldn't I reach you?

574
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,210
Huh?

575
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,290
I asked why you couldn't be reached.

576
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,710
Do you know how much I worried?

577
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,920
Shouldn't I be saying that?

578
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,460
Precisely, I called you since you called me dozens of times, but you didn't answer.

579
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,190
I thought something serious happened.

580
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,800
Where did you go today?

581
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,320
I got some fresh air. What's going on?

582
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,110
With whom?

583
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,300
- Didn't you call because of something urgent?
 - With whom?

584
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,440
Well, I was with Ah Rin.

585
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,920
She didn't want to go to kindergarten today.

586
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,970
Just the two of you?

587
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,880
Did you know?

588
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,460
Of course, it was just us. Who else?

589
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,060
I'm sorry.

590
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,150
I was going to tell you in the evening since you're busy.

591
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,460
Why didn't you call your girlfriend to replace a busy mom, then?

592
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,400
Are you angry because I let her skip kindergarten without telling you?

593
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,260
Do you really not know, or are you just pretending?

594
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,770
- What do you mean?
 - Do you really not know why I'm like this?

595
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,010
I really don't know. Let's hear it.

596
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,900
I'm sorry I let her skip kindergarten without telling you, but this is too much.

597
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,940
Can't you please be honest at least once?

598
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,690
The innocent look on your face really—

599
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,380
Jae Won.

600
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,920
I really don't know.

601
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,570
I don't know why you're like this lately.

602
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,330
I really don't know.

603
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,130
 69th Class, Choi Dong Ho

604
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,640
Hey.

605
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,190
 Hey, Seo Jae Won. Are you a no-show today again?

606
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:10,040
 I know you're busy, but you should come to the reunion.

607
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,920
Was there a reunion today?

608
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,280
 Didn't you hear from Yun Jin?

609
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,390
Yun Jin came, too?

610
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,810
Of course. She came a while ago.

611
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,320
Where are you right now?

612
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,790
 2023 Hanguk University School of Art, 69th Class Reunion

613
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,020
It's Jae Won!

614
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,980
Hey, Seo Jae Won!

615
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,710
Welcome!

616
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,330
Seo Jae Won! Seo Jae Won!

617
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,700
Seo Jae Won!

618
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,800
You don't mind me sitting here, right?

619
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,770
Of course not.

620
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,340
I didn't tell you intentionally because you didn't seem too well these days.

621
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,130
I don't know how to thank you.

622
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,330
You want beer, right?

623
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,710
Hey, she can't drink yet.

624
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,850
Seriously, is there something going on with you lately?

625
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,380
How are you these days?

626
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,250
Nothing's going on?

627
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,790
Aren't you hiding anything from me?

628
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,750
What's there to hide from you?

629
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,310
I'm always stuck inside painting.

630
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,290
Hey, don't be like that and spill the beans.

631
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,780
What's the secret behind your success?

632
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,960
Wow, I never would've imagined you'd become this successful.

633
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,310
- When she was in college, she was— 
- Hey, hey.

634
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,720
What are you saying?

635
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,330
You're right. Yun Jin was more successful than me in college.

636
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,720
Yes. Everyone knew Kwon Yun Jin in the art college.

637
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,610
I really thought Yun Jin would become hugely successful.

638
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:15,290
Gosh, I'm so sorry I didn't become hugely successful.

639
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:20,030
Aigoo, aigoo. You are successful. You're the only artist among us.

640
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:23,040
It's not easy to stay in the field for over 20 years.

641
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,270
You're right. It would've been easy if you got help from your father.

642
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,070
You did it on your own. I'll admit it.

643
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,990
Should we elevate things and talk about your projects?

644
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,090
We haven't had a chance to talk about it.

645
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,840
Gosh, it's fine. It's boring. Don't.

646
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,750
Why don't we talk about your broken engagement instead?

647
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,700
We never got to talk about it.

648
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,300
Hey, what are you doing?

649
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,300
Is your ex doing well?

650
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,950
Is it because he's a successful entrepreneur?

651
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,100
There was an article about his wedding recently.

652
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,290
Which actress was it? Who was it?

653
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,530
Kim Mi So.

654
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:23,590
She's a model, not an actress.

655
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,990
Looks like you're still interested.

656
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,780
Looks like you are.

657
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:31,840
I didn't know you kept up with my ex-boyfriend.

658
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:38,340
I know how interested you are in my family and husband.

659
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,740
Hey. You must be really drunk.

660
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,200
Hey, why are you doing this on a happy occasion?

00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,260
Hey, Professor Han is here.

662
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,040
Professor!

663
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,820
Yun Jin, let's say hello to Professor.

664
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,060
Wow. Professor!

665
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,600
You remember Yun Jin, right?

666
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,080
Have a seat.

667
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,740
Yun Jin did really well, then.

668

00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,990
 Are you up?

670
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,230
 I didn't wake you because you were sleeping soundly.

671
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,190
 I made you dried pollack soup. Eat it before leaving for work.

672
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,580
 I put the paperwork delivered from the office in the study.

673
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:06,540
Why is the certified copy of the apartment deed here?

 Her husband, Mr. Seo Chang Seok, collected the payment when your mother passed.

Hey.

683
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,040
 Ms. Seo, you know the meeting with J Department Store was moved up to this morning, right?

684
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,480
I sent a copy of the contract to your house.

685
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,970
Yes, okay. I'll be there on time.

686
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,360
No, I'll go straight to the department store.

687
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,200
Okay, thank you.

Ah Rin!

690
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,630
Welcome! Gosh, you're so pretty!

691
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,930
Shit. Are you okay?

692
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,400
Watch your driving!

♫  I can fly to the stars  ♫

696
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:36,620
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

697
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,550
♫  I can fly to the moon  ♫

698
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:44,630
♫  I can fly to the stars  ♫

699
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,390
♫  There is a night like a lie   ♫

700
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,980
♫  hidden within it  ♫

701
01:04:53,980 --> 01:05:01,830
♫  Following a darkened path I walked aimlessly  ♫

702
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:08,480
♫  even if I'm abandoned in the world will my heart feel better?  ♫

703
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,610
♫  I'm standing at the crossroads  ♫

704
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:17,900
♫  where my future was deternined  ♫

705
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,500
♫  and painfully inscribed in white ashes  ♫

706
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,590
♫   and I am lost   ♫

707
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:28,510
♫  I can fly to the moon  ♫

 My Happy Ending

709
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,190
 Your loved one has a different side to them.

710
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:38,680
 Can you even imagine how that feels?

711
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,140
 Jae Won, you can take a break if it's too tough.

712
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,800
 - I'll help you.
 - But I don't know anymore.

713
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,200
 Don't go.

714
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,010
 I'll help you.

715
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:51,760
 The man I'm seeing isn't Jae Won's husband.

716
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,410
 You mean the culprit was captured on it?

717
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,070
 You have to use it. What if you're abandoned again?

718
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,020
 Why isn't this working?

719
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,290
 The car won't stop!
