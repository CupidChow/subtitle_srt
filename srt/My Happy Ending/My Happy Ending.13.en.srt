Okay, got it.

Are you really thinking of jumping in yourself?

Yes. It has to be me.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,430
Is that why you sent the security guard home, too?

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,780

Looks like you decided...

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,750
whether it's the minister position or Kwon Yun Jin.

26
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,920
Your eyes are still as venomous as they were 30 years ago.

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,030
The look you had in your eyes when you tried not to show you had nothing.

28
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,690
You're still looking at me like that even when you're tied up and can't do anything.

29
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,890
I sponsored you because I liked that about you.

30
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,440
When your mother lost your college tuition you saved working a part-time job on gambling

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,570
and when you had to take out a private loan to make a prototype for Dereve, I was the one

32
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,160
who sponsored you.

33
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,980
How could you utter those words with your mouth?

34
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,530
Would you believe me if I said Heo Sun Yeong's death was unavoidable?

35
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,350
That was...

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
- an accident-
- Shut your mouth!

37
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,530
Accident?

38
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,100
Sun Yeong... My husband...

39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,330
You know how he died.

40
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,820
You would've done the same if you were in my shoes.

41
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,500
Because everyone...

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,640
wants to protect what's precious to them.

43
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,530
Cut the nonsense, you son of a bitch.

44
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,650
To cover up what Kwon Yun Jin did,

45
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,320
and for your career, you killed Sun Yeong.

46
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,590
You're a murderer.

47
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,340
You fed...

48
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,880
Sun Yeong pesticide and let him die painfully. You murderer.

49
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,960
You should've lived properly, then.

50
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,400
Only if your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong didn't go awry,

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,380
Yun Jin wouldn't have been with him.

52
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,290
Only if you didn't provoke Yun Jin,

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,710
she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

54
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,220
the audio file wouldn't have been created, either.

55
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,870
If only you didn't lose your memory,

56
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,470
Heo Sun Yeong wouldn't have come to Yun Jin and kneeled before her the day he died.

57
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,030
And I wouldn't have had to take care of Heo Sun Yeong, either.

58
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,000
You're the one who got him killed.

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,240

How did the police know and come so quickly?

79
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,350
That's what I find suspicious.

80
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,570
Did we leave any traces?

81
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,160
We did not.

82
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,190
Got it.

83
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,610
- You can leave.
- Okay.

84
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,060
Did you go somewhere at this late hour?

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,140
What are you doing right now?

86
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,130
Did you come back without being able to do anything?

87
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,750
What?

88
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,460

[Written will]

90
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,110
It doesn't say much.

91
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,040
Since everything I own came from you,

92
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,290
I should naturally inherit all of it.

93
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,460
You've always told me.

94
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,870
That you're useless unless you're in the first place.

95
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,710
You're no longer useful now.

96
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,070
Attorney Kim, what happened?

97
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm sorry.

98
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,680
Attorney Kim, I'm sorry, but could you give us some space?

99
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,110
- You-
- You need to accept it.

100
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,660
Otherwise, I'd be in danger.

101
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,440
I know you care about me more than anything.

102
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:18,500
I know that everything you've done was for my sake.

103
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,040
That's why you hit me,

104
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,780
made me break up with my boyfriend,

105
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,660
and did all the dirty work for me, too.

106
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,120
When did I start realizing that?

107
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,850
Was it since that day seven years ago?

108
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,600
Or was it since Seo Jae Won became your trophy?

109
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,580
If that's not it, either...

110
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,550
it might've been the day you hit me for the first time.

111
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,530
But none of that matters now.

112
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,550
What's important is that you love me a lot, Father.

113
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,950
Thank you...

114
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,220

115
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,370
Are you awake now?

116
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,740
What happened?

117
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,620
It could've been really terrible if I got there a little later.

118
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,870
What happened to your face?

119
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,180
It's nothing. I just got scratched up.

120
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,750
You're angry.

121
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,510
Yes.

122
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,110
I thought you were seriously going to die.

123
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,690
I'm sorry, Te Oh.

124
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,550
How about the thing?

125
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Here.

126
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,100
Only if you didn't provoke Yun Jin,

127
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,520
she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

128
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,340

129
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,700
If only you didn't lose your memory, Heo Sun Yeong wouldn't...

130
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,370
What are you planning to do now?

131
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,340
If we take this to the police or the press,

132
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,280
they'd call it fabricated or a deep fake and downplay it.

133
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,870
It might ruin things for us.

134
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,900
You're right.

135
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,690
This is where Seo Jae Won got kidnapped?

136
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,900
Yes. It was a total fiasco last night.

137
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,390
Gosh, those uncreative bastards.

138
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,800
Pardon?

139
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,310
You didn't find anything?

140
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,480
Nothing in particular.

141
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,300
You didn't notice anything weird?

142
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,900
Yun Te Oh was already at the scene before we came.

143
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,540
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,320
I don't know how he knew.

145
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,420
It looked like he had a fight with the kidnapper.

146
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,750
Are you sure you can leave?

147
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,440
Yes, I'm okay.

148
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,190
The police hasn't found anything yet.

149
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,650
Okay.

150
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,120
Te Oh,

151
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,350
the man you fought last night.

152
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,880
Didn't he look familiar?

153
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,140
He's the one who broke into your house.

154
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,660
Right?

155
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,700
I think we need to be careful.

156
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,160
Are you feeling okay?

157
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,250
Yes.

158
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,640
That's a relief.

159
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,930
I need to ask you a few things.

160
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,360
But unfortunately, I don't remember anything. What do I do?

161
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,480
Just tell me whatever you remember.

162
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,210
Let's do this later.

163
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,250
Please come back when her condition stabilizes.

164
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,540
It'd help us catch the culprit if you could tell me how you got kidnapped.

165
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,840
Let's talk some other time.

166
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,010
Okay, then. See you later.

167
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,480
Here's a list of questions and answers for the parliamentary inspection.

168
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,080
Did you find the person who leaked the internal file?

169
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm sorry, not yet-

170
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,700
- You can leave.
- Okay.

171
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,130
Secretary Jeong.

172
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,420
Yes, Minister.

173
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,500
How long have you worked here?

174
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,900
Has it been five years?

175
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,750
Yes, that's correct.

176
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,700
You've been...

177
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,760
doing such a great job.

178
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,090
Well done.

179
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,710
Thank you.

180
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,190
Are you enjoying this life?

181
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,620
What do you work so hard for?

182
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,920
It's what I'm supposed to do.

183
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,340
You have a lot of things to lose now, CEO Kwon.

184
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,610
What brings you here?

185
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,230
Seo Jae Won's kidnap.

186
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,190
She says she doesn't remember it

187
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,530
and Yun Te Oh showed up before the police.

188
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,960
Something's very fishy about it.

189
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,260
Would Minister Kwon...

190
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,620
be okay?

191
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,340
I don't think you need to worry.

192
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,100
What happened to Baek Seung Gyu?

193
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,440
I hired some people.

194
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,550
I don't think you need to worry.

195
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,580
You think some kids could do the job?

196
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,930
Are you sure you don't need to go to my place?

197
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,480
Why would I go there instead of my house?

198
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,060
What if something like that happens again?

199
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,290
Kwon Yeong Ik kidnapped you. He could do something worse.

200
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,080
But I still need to go.

201
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,690
It's my house.

202
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,100
You seem to have steel in your body instead of blood sometimes.

203
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm glad you think that.

204
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,430
I was actually...

205
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,390
kind of scared.

206
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,270
I thought I expected it and prepared for it,

207
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,490
but it was different when it actually happened.

208
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,970
That's when you showed up.

209
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,950
I just did what I was supposed to do.

210
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,780
But that can't happen again.

211
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll stop it myself.

212
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,700
Thank you.

213
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,200
Detective Oh from earlier. What do you think of her?

214
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,520
Let's think a bit more.

215
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,100
We need to be careful.

216
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,410
Who are these people-

217
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,390
Well, I hired them.

218
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,010
We need to prepare seriously now.

219
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,600
Why did you ask to go to your place, then?

220
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,170
Two-track strategy. Haven't you heard of it?

221
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,410
You take two directions simultaneously when you approach an issue.

222
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,240
Go in now.

223
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,700
I have more things to do.

224
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,170
See you.

225
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,520
Here are the files for the Ministry of Culture's business activities, private contracts,

226
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,440
and Minister Kwon's parliamentary inspection schedule.

227
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Thank you.

228
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:18,350
The secretaries who enter the minister's office are being watched because of the corruption report.

229
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,720
I don't think I could help you more. I'm sorry.

230
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,060
What you've given me is already enough.

231
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,730
Did you need to tell me something?

232
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,640
It's nothing. I'll get going now.

233
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,790
When did you learn Ms. Seo was kidnapped?

234
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,870
Was it around 11? It must've been.

235
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,760
We received the report around 11:05.

236
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,850
Then, you must've reported as soon as you learned about the kidnap...

237
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,480
through Ms. Kim Seong Hui.

238
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,760
Yes, that's correct.

239
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,080
What made you certain that Ms. Seo was kidnapped?

240
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,610
What I want to know is if the circumstances

241
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:05,210
made you certain she was kidnapped by chance.

242
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,610
I'm not sure about that.

243
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,530
You must not know Mr. Baek Seung Gyu disappeared recently.

244
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,300
I know you think Ms. Seo was framed for Mr. Heo's case.

245
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,900
- Is that why you're acting this way?
- Detective.

246
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,870
How am I supposed to trust you?

247
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,270
The only thing I know about you is your name.

248
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,110
Oh, me?

249
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,800
Born in 1976, the year of the dragon.

250
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,090
I'm the only child, and both of my parents are alive. I'm a good runner.

251
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,090
To become a police officer, I've spent 20 years...

252
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,550
desperately without getting married. I'm Yongshin Police Station's

253
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,780
Lieutenant Oh Su Jin.

254
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,210
Ask me anything you want to know.

255
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,590
You know Nam Tae Ju, right?

256
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,050
Yes. He was my classmate.

257
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,460
I know.

258
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,620
Both Detective Lee Jang Hyeon and Nam Tae Ju

259
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,930
are from Yongshin Police Station.

260
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,250
Player, this is your line.

261
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,130
Anchor. Six. The player wins.

262
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,070
Hyungnim, someone's here to see you.

263
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,210
Tell them I'm busy.

264
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,530
She insisted on seeing you now.

265
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,580
Are you deaf? I'm busy.

266
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,200
She said she'll search and confiscate if you don't come out now.

267
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,410
Why didn't you come inside?

268
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,160
If I did,

269
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,340
I'd have to arrest everyone in there.

270
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,520
How did you know I was here?

271
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
It's not a secret that you go to casinos.

272
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,120
Hey, by the way, it got bigger.

273
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,390
What do you want?

274
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,910
Seo Jae Won.

275
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,730
Are you here to sound me out?

276
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,250
You'd know if you tracked the places I go to.

277
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,560
I know you have an alibi.

278
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,030
But?

279
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,370
You were...

280
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,220
involved in the Heo Sun Yeong case, too.

281
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,600
Gosh, you gave up on your promotion now. Didn't you?

282
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,470
That's why you're saying nonsense here.

283
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,390
I'm here to warn you.

284
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,640
Don't take it all the way.

285
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,620
All the way?

286
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,860
Are you telling me not to commit murder?

287
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,430
That's why I'm calling you myself.

288
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,010
I was wondering what your schedule was like.

289
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,580
Yes.

290
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,810
I'll see you that day, then.

291
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay.

292
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,990
Is everything okay?

293
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,660
You didn't notice anyone strange?

294
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,170
Not at all.

295
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,470
Have you eaten?

296
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,250
I ate something simple.

297
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,650
You didn't eat, right?

298
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,240
It looks like you didn't even touch that.

299
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,740
I got you a gourmet sandwich because I knew you didn't eat.

300
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,390
What do you think of Detective Oh since you got to meet her?

301
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,030
I do think she's different than Nam Tae Ju.

302
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,180
But I'm not sure if she's driven by achievements or a sense of justice.

303
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,910
It'd be a disaster if she gets the video from us and sends it to Kwon Yeong Ik.

304
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,940
Have a seat and eat.

305
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,600
According to the National Assembly law, Article 127, Clause 1,

306
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,070
the legislation regarding parliamentary inspection and investigation,

307
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:22,410
we'll start the 2023 parliamentary inspection of the Ministry of Culture.

308
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,810
I heard Minister Kwon influenced

309
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,580
the appointment for the director of the National Opera.

310
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,080
That's not true.

311
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,730
Your daughter is currently the CEO of the furniture company Dereve, correct?

312
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:45,080
Are you denying you've been supplying Dereve with the Ministry of Culture's business subsidies?

313
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,650
Dereve was chosen through a fair and strict process.

314
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,900
Can you be responsible for what you just said?

315
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,090
Yes.

316
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,350
As a chairman, I'll ask Minister Kwon Yeong Ik a few questions.

317
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:06,030
Minister Kwon, high-ranking public officials should be completely faultless, correct?

318
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,640
- Correct.
- Do you...

319
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
think you live up to that standard as a minister?

320
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,350
I think I'm doing my best.

321
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,910
Is that so?

322
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,340
I heard an unsavory rumor recently.

323
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,210
- Please go on.
- The rumor says...

324
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,000
You're the culprit in the recent Seo Jae Won case.

325
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,750
That's a baseless rumor, Chairman.

326
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,610
You'll have to take responsibility for your comment just now.

327
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,520
Really?

328
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Even if there was a witness to testify to that?

329
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,510
The witness may come out.

330
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:27,240
Ms. Seo Jae Won, is Minister Kwon the culprit in the recent kidnapping incident?

331
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,190
He is.

332
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,880
Can you prove it?

333
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,980
There's evidence.

334
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,450
I get to see you like this again.

335
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,640
Of course, it was you.

336
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,250
Kwon Yeong Ik.

337
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,290
Are you really thinking of jumping in yourself?

338
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes. It has to be me.

339
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,110
Would you believe me if I said Heo Sun Yeong's death was unavoidable?

340
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,050
That was an accident.

341
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,100
To cover up what Kwon Yun Jin did,

342
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,150
and for your career,

343
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,160
you killed Sun Yeong.

344
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,860
You're a murderer.

345
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,020
You should've lived properly, then.

346
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,960
Only if you didn't provoke Yun Jin,

347
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,460
she wouldn't have gotten involved with Baek Seung Gyu and

348
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,260
the audio file wouldn't have been created, either.

349
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,310
And I wouldn't have had to take care of Heo Sun Yeong, either.

350
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,830
This is a setup.

351
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,300
The video was fabricated.

352
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,740
Seo Jae Won is a mental patient who just left a mental institute.

353
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,800
She can't be trusted.

354
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik.

355
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,570
You're under arrest for kidnapping Seo Jae Won and murdering Heo Sun Yeong.

356
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,310
Please stand up.

357
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,720
You have the right to an attorney.

358
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,410
And you have the right to deny any testimonies made against you.

- No way!

Here's breaking news.

373
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,280
During the parliamentary inspection for the Ministry of Culture this morning,

374
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,250
Minister Kwon Yeong Ik was proven to be the culprit of the Seo Jae Won kidnapping case.

375
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,960
Also, the culprit of the murder of Heo Sun Yeong, Seo Jae Won's late husband, from last August

376
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,140
turned out to be Minister Kwon Yeong Ik, and the nation is in great shock.

377
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,750
The police are trying to determine Minister Kwon's motive for murder.

378
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,040
I knew something was strange.

379
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,500

♫ There is a night like a lie hidden within it ♫

384
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,060
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik, are you sure you murdered

385
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,300
Mr. Heo Sun Yeong on your own?

386
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,280
You purchased this pesticide yourself, too?

387
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,540
Mr. Kwon Yeong Ik, aren't you going to answer?

388
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,720
Forcing him to answer can be considered coercion.

389
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,660
There's no point in doing this right now.

390
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,400
There's clear evidence.

391
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,440
I did everything. By myself.

392
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,910
- By yourself?
- Please delete that part out.

393
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,960
He said that because he's weak mentally and physically right now.

394
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,700
Weak mentally and physically? Let's say that.

395
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,910
But I can't delete that comment.

396
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,120
Why did you create an alibi for Kwon Yun Jin that day, then?

397
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,760
Are you sure you did it on your own?

398
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,780
Who's the man you were with when you kidnapped Seo Jae Won?

399
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,140
You don't know that person, either?

400
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,820
We acquired the information regarding the audio file.

401

While trying to cover up Baek Seung Gyu's fall incident,

402
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,910
you ended up murdering Heo Sun Yeong, too.

403
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,240
Because of your daughter, Kwon Yun Jin.

404
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,760
You think remaining silent like this would help, Minister? Do you?

405
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,300
Jae Won, I was just about to-

406
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,460

407
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,680

I'm sorry.

409
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,730
I didn't want you to find out like this.

Don't ever do that from now on.

It's okay. It's a relief.

413
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,560
It's such a relief.

414
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,950
It must've been so hard.

415
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,740
You had to do this for Sun Yeong.

416
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,890

418
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,970
Okay, I will.

419

421
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,040
Not yet.

According to Detective Oh, Kwon Yeong Ik insists he did it alone.

426
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,070
Do you think he's trying to take the blame for Seung Gyu's case, too?

427
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,230
I'm not sure.

428
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,380
I don't feel relieved for some reason.

429
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,930
That man could show up any time, too.

430
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,310
I've been thinking about that man.

431
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,010
Maybe he's a Yein Foundation's former scholarship student.

432
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,300
The foundation?

433
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,560
Yes. Including Seung Gyu and Secretary Jeong,

434
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,300
many former students of the Yein Foundation are around.

435
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,200

513
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,720
Why did you meet with him that day? On the rooftop, even.

514
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,710
Seung Gyu was our foundation's scholarship student.

515
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,270
Was I not supposed to meet someone I know?

516

We went up there because we wanted to talk quietly.

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,940
What answer do you want to hear from me?

519
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,610
Will you trap me in here until you hear that answer?

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,880
Where were you on the day Heo Sun Yeong was murdered?

521
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,460
I was with my friends.

522

You must know that can't be your alibi anymore.

00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,090
That's the only answer I can give you.

Whether that can be the alibi or not

525
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,550

You want me to find conclusive evidence?

528
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,890
What if that man was also at Sun Yeong's murder scene?

529
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:39,590
Does he somehow have something to do with Yun Jin?

530

Not to mention what Kwon Yeong Ik said.

531

00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,750
Yes.

535
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,100
Yes, of course.

536
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,630
Being acquainted with someone who works for her dad, they looked way too friendly.

537
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,270
Kwon Yun Jin.

538
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,510
All of this was intended by Kwon Yun Jin.

539
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,870
Am I jumping to conclusions?

540
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,850
No. You know Yun Jin better than anyone.

541
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,230
That's true. That's true.

542
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,240
Kwon Yeong Ik is a dad, too.

543
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,280
What if he's taking the blame for everything?

544
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,800
You would've done the same if you were in my shoes.

545
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,330
Because everyone...

546
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,850
wants to protect what's precious to them.

547
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,550
She was at the scene.

548
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,070
Kwon Yun Jin.

549
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,750
It's not too late now.

550
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,970
I need to confirm their relationship.

551
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,100
Right?

552
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,020
Right.

553
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,850
Are you okay?

554
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:00,000
♫ Doesn't matter after all ♫

555
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:09,100
♫ In the time I cleared off. I wonder... ♫

556
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,800
I don't even know when it started.

557
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,990
She's always been a friend who comforted me.

558
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,590
She won't disappear even after realizing she's not real.

559
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,690
I thought I had overcome everything,

560
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,110
but this hasn't changed.

561
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:42,150
♫ Your smile is stuck inside my heart ♫

562
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,500
Do you see her now, too?

563
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:51,160
♫ Dull greetings in the midst of whispers ♫

564
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,750
Look at me.

565
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,950
I'll be by your side.

566
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:10,190
♫ Whenever you come around awhile ♫

567
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,810
Baek Seung Gyu was hiding like a little mouse.

568
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,120
Where's this place?

569
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,110
Let's decide what to do before we make a move.

570
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,170
Decide what?

571
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,750
What will you do with Baek Seung Gyu?

572
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,280
We should take care of him. Once and for all.

573
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,250
It's good to keep things simple,

574
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,020
but you should talk to me in advance going forward.

575
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,510
What do you mean by that?

576
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,300
The press conference and giving away the foundation.

577
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:56,220
How come you get things done without having a word with me?

578
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,040
Your share remains the same.

579
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,300
Don't worry.

580
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,370
That's not your specialty, Mr. Nam.

581
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,580
That's right.

582
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,170
This is my specialty.

583
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,200
I wanted to give you a painting

584
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,650
to celebrate your return.

585
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,630
Where do you want to hang it?

586
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,770
This would be good, right?

587
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,850
I think this is the perfect spot.

588
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,130
What are you trying to do?

589
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
The painting.

590
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,260
I'm here to gift it to you.

591
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,360
I thought you'd like it.

592
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,070
What do you think?

593
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,510
Isn't our Ah Rin so pretty?

594
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,880
You're no fun.

595
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,120
"What a surprise. It's so pretty."

596
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,600
I wanted to hear you saying stuff like that.

597
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Don't use what happened seven years ago to escape from everything you've done.

598
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,790
Of course...

599
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,840
you're so shameless.

600
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,030
Ever since I saw you and that bastard at the hotel seven years ago,

601
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,070
I've never forgotten it, even for a moment.

602
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,760
I didn't intent for that to happen that day at all.

603
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,600
You know that, too.

604
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,510
Why?

605
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,540
Are you trying to hide behind your lofty illness again?

606
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,540
Or you couldn't help it because you drank too much?

607
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,950
If that wasn't it, either,

608
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,030
was it because of your medicine?

609
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,550
Jae Won,

610
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,580
do you think stuff like that could be an excuse now?

611
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,570
You could've easily told me.

612
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:43,360
You've been the closest person I had for the past 30 years

613
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,980
and you knew about my pain better than anyone.

614
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,640
You turned away from me.

615
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,580
How about you?

616
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,730
Have you ever even thought about my pain at all?

617
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,820
Have you ever thought about how I must've felt seeing you

618
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,230
after losing my entire world?

619
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,380
You could've taken revenge on just me.

620
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,640
Why did you do that to Sun Yeong?

621
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,710
Because you...

622
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,880
took something precious from me first.

623
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,990
I just did the exact same thing.

624
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,730
Did you think I'd be hurt by nonsense like that?

625
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,690
Did you say "lofty illness"?

626
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:43,250
You're the one who actually needs treatment, Kwon Yun Jin.

627
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,360
No, you should be punished.

628
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,350
You're not a patient. You're a criminal.

629
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,060
What?

630
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,270
I'm a criminal?

631
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,240
You were there when Sun Yeong was murdered, too.

632
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,770
Did you lose your mind again?

633
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,080
My father killed him.

634
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,530
You announced that to the entire world.

635
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,010
I know you intended that.

636
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,020
How do you know?

637
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,350
Did you see it yourself?

638
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,830
Or maybe you know since you've done it yourself?

639
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,240
You...

640
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,180
think you won, don't you?

641
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,410
A person died!

642
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,950
A person died, okay?

643
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,610
What's the point of winning or losing?

644
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,490
Don't think what you know...

645
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,940
is everything.

646
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,120
Look forward to it this time, too.

647
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,900
Yes.

648
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,440
Reporter Choi,

649
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,330
you have what I gave you last time, right?

650
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Yes, of course.

651
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,240
You said you'll decide when.

652
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,570
You remember.

653
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,500
It's been so long.

654
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,890
Fishing with just the two of us.

655
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,770
Yes, right.

656
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,540
I can't even remember when the last time was.

657
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,890
Is this the first time since Ah Rin was born?

658
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:37,470
Yes. Sun Yeong's been your fishing buddy since I've been busy.

659
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,130
He wasn't even good at fishing.

660
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,490
It took him forever just to hook a bait.

661
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,030
Once he finally tossed it,

662
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,900
the line got tangled up, too.

663
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,730
He always looked for me, saying, "Father, Father."

664
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,960
That's how Sun Yeong was.

665
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,110
He wanted to compete and fish against me so badly.

666
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:20,240
Dad, has anyone visited you lately?

667
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,130
Or have you noticed someone watching you?

668
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:35,840
If I went straight to Ms. Seo and told her how her mom died and everything,

669
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,760
what would happen?

670
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,590
Shut your mouth.

671
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,460
How dare you say such nonsense...

672
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,290
Why do you feel so guilty about everything?

673
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:50,070
I suppose that's why you didn't request an autopsy after she died.

674
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,090
No, no one has.

675
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,400
Who would visit the countryside like this?

676
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,690
Are you sure?

677
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,070
Yes. No one came.

678
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,700
That's a relief, then.

679
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,170
I guess I'm worrying too much.

680
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,980
We'll be protecting Mr. Baek. Don't worry so much.

681
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,170
I'll be in charge instead of Detective Lee Jang Hyeon as well.

682
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,780
Thank you.

683
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:39,600
By the way, do you really think Kwon Yun Jin is behind everything?

684
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,020
We don't know for sure.

685
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,450
But Seung Gyu agreed to testify.

686
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,420
So start from there.

687
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,890
Well, then...

688
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:08,220
Yes, Hyungnim. Detective Oh met with Yun Te Oh at the station.

689
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,790
I'm almost there.

690
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,890
I'm on my way, too.

691
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,000
See you later.

692
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,380
Okay.

693
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,210
You can't come in here.

694
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,960
I'm Seung Gyu's guardian.

695
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,490
Let him in.

696
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,350
Seung Gyu! Baek Seung Gyu!

697
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,180
- Seung Gyu!
- You can't go in.

698
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,420
Excuse me, wait...

699
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,450
You can't go in.

700
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,350
- Don't look.
- What... What's happening?

701
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:23,280
Te Oh! What... What's going on?

702
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,000
- Yun Te Oh!
- Ms. Seo.

703
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,560
Yun Te Oh!

704
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:19,280
♫ Why would it happen? ♫

705
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,140
♫ Like how it all has been connected ♫

706
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,970
♫ Only if I don't ♫

707
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,940
♫ In between the empty darkness ♫

708
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:37,840
♫ I wanna know. You blow in. ♫

709
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:46,130
♫ I wanna know ♫

710
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:50,100
♫ I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch ♫

711
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,970
♫ In the wave of memory surging over the end ♫

712
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,860
♫ I'm not okay, I can't hear your voice ♫

01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:03,840
♫ I picture us who are only in my dream ♫

714
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,220
♫ I will cling to it ♫

715
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:11,150
♫ On the truth, which is harsh, the aborted ending ♫

[My Happy Ending]

717
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:18,940
We can't sacrifice anymore if Kwon Yun Jin is behind everything.

718
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,280
How am I supposed to trust you?

719
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,150
Will you trust me if I give you what you want?

720
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,830
I'm relieved that you look better than I expected.

721
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,070
Would you be able to handle it?

722
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,530
What else can I do?

723
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,610
Will you spend the rest of your life in prison?

724
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,730
Think carefully.

725
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:34,830
You'll need me to catch Kwon Yun Jin and save your father.

726
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,370
Don't say anything in the trial tomorrow.

727
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:40,300
Ms. Seo's trial won't go the way you want.

728
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,830
How does it feel to send your father to prison?

729
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:47,340
Kwon Yun Jin, no secret lasts forever.
