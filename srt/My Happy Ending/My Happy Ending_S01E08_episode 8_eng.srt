Where are you going this late at night?

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,400
Will you really be okay?

12
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,410
Where are you going?

13
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,450
By chance,

14
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,800
do you really not care...

15
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,910
about the people who are left behind?

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,840
Did you think you could end everything this way?

This can't be the end.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,150
It's just another beginning.

24
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,630
You know.

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,160
Because this isn't the first time.

What's the deal?

31

 My Ah Rin...

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,280
 Please raise her well.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,410
 I'm sorry, Honey.

34
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,870
 I went to the hotel because I had more work, but I ended up falling asleep.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,070
  CEO Seo Jae Won introduces new line

36
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,090
 Message

37
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,770
 International message - Hello, this is Manager Lee Min Jeong. We're hiring people who can work independently...

 Call Recordings

39
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,830
 Father.

40
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,790
 Father, I need you to help me.

41
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,150
 S-Seung Gyu...

42
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,960
 Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,780
 It couldn't be helped because he threatened to kill us both.

44
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,670
 Is he dead?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 Episode 8

46
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,320
Looking for something?

47
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,920
My medicine. My medicine was...

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,380
Medicine? Why? Are you sick?

49
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,230
My shoulders felt a little sore.

50
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,610
Oh, I made your favorite, the green smoothie.

51
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,590
Don't work out on an empty stomach; drink it before you go.

52
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,200
Okay?

53
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
 Headache

54
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,370
I'll come home early tonight.

55
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,820
Let's discuss what we couldn't last night.

56
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,660
You know, Yun Jin?

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,340
I couldn't reach her. Do you know anything?

58
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,670
I'm not sure.

59
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't know.

60
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,360
I know, right?

61
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course. Why did I ask you about Yun Jin?

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,890
See you later.

63
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,860
 Headache

64
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,770
CEO.

65
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,100
Yes.

66
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,770
Ms. Kwon Yun Jin is here.

67
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,120
Give me just five minutes.

68
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,310
Artist Kwon Yun Jin.

69
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,450
Why won't you answer my calls? I was worried.

70
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,070
- What are you doing?
 - Why are you suddenly so surprised?

71
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,670
Do you want some coffee? Have a seat.

72
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,340
Here.

73
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,910
Since we're hiring a talented artist,

74
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,420
we'll make sure you get the best treatment.

75
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,670
What are you plotting?

76
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,020
You wanted to forget about the contract. Why did you change your mind?

77
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,170
Who did? Me?

78
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,380
Do you have to ask?

79
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,240
Did I actually say that?

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,310
That can't be.

81
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,420
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

82
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,170
We already went through the contract terms in detail...

83
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,250
Did we?

84
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,830
Are you doing this on purpose?

85
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,150
No, I'm not.

86
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,680
There's nothing good about being a CEO of a company.

87
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,960
There are so many things to process all day.

88
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,200
If you stay up all night every day, today feels like yesterday, and today feels like tomorrow.

89
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,510
I don't even know what the date is.

90
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,150
I forget what I said once I turn around. So...

91
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,500
I hope you understand if I made a mistake.

92
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,390
Seo Jae Won.

93
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,960
 What's wrong with my arm?

94
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,220
 Did I get injured?

95
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,250
- Are you by chance—
 - By chance, what?

96
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,690
Why won't you finish the sentence?

97
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,380
Never mind.

98
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,850
This won't necessarily be bad for me.

99
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,950
I'll sign after looking through the contract.

100
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,960
That'll be okay, right?

101
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,580
Okay.

102
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,700
It's better to be clear on things the closer you are.

103
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,300
I'm happy to work with you, Ms. Kwon.

104
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,390
I'll get going.

105
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,330
See you.

106
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,630
Yes.

107
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,790
 Team Leader, this is Seong Hui. Where are you?

108
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,010
I'm on my way back. What's this about?

109
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,950
 The CEO is a bit...

110
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,350
What?

111
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,010
What is it?

112
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,430
She was gone for two days, but I feel like...

113
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,090
she's behaving differently.

114
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,420
Pretend like you didn't notice and keep an eye on her.

115
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,570
I'll be right there.

116
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,110
Sun Yeong, what are you doing here at this hour?

117
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,650
When did that start again?

118
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,540
It was after she saw you that day.

119
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,650
And I couldn't reach her for two days. Her phone was off, too.

120
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,700
She showed up as a totally different person yesterday,

121
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,310
as if nothing ever happened.

122
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,950
Well, that can happen when you're busy.

123
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,160
Sounds like it's nothing serious.

124
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,230
And she probably wanted to get along with you—

125
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,190
How about this, then?

126
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,930
This is the medicine I asked you about last time, right?

127
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,970
I told you about this already.

128
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,400
She takes it for her headache.

129
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,610
How about the wounds on her arm, then?

130
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,440
She did that very briefly when she was a kid.

131
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,950
It's because she had a difficult childhood because of her mom.

132
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,280
She did it out of anger a few times since she couldn't relieve stress...

133
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,150
I swear she's not like that anymore.

134
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,120
Yes, I know.

135
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,980
I heard from Jae Won. She said exactly what you said just now.

136
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,640
As if you made an agreement.

137
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,260
Sun Yeong, could you...

138
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,330
Could you wait just a tiny bit?

139
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,710
I'm begging you.

140
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,990
Father, waiting won't solve an issue like this.

141
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,500
Please tell me.

142
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,100
Father.

143
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,330
All right.

144
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,030
I'll find out on my own.

145
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,480
Sun Yeong! Sun Yeong!

146
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,190
I didn't even hear you. You scared me.

147
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,450
What are you doing here?

148
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,590
Aren't you too interested in me these days?

149
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,700
Should I be happy?

150
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,480
I asked what you're doing here.

151
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,920
What are you trying to do this time?

152
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,060
I'm here to work, too.

153
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Don't you know I signed an artist contract with Derêve?

154
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,680
I know.

155
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,380
And I know everything you did to Ms. Seo, too.

156
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,260
You don't even call me "Seonbae" anymore.

157
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,980
But you're wrong this time.

158
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,110
I didn't do anything.

159
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,880
Seo Jae Won suggested it first.

160
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,170
Looks like you know, too,

161
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,430
that Jae Won has an issue.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,340
It's really a shame.

163
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,430
Her husband cheated on her with her best friend,

164
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,030
but she completely forgot about it.

165
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,120
So, I'm thinking of helping her,

166
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,490
to do my duty as a friend.

167
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,570
Good day.

168
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,890
CEO Seo!

169
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,990
Why don't we talk for a second?

170
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,340
She won't be able to today.

171
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,620
Make an appointment if you want an interview.

172
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,210
I came because she couldn't be reached.

173
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,950
Please tell me how you're feeling these days.

174
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,700
Regarding what, exactly?

175
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,920
Interview me instead.

176
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,800
You can ask me instead.

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,330
I think we didn't finish the interview last time.

178
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,670
You'd better leave when I'm asking nicely.

179
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,570
Reporter Choi Do Hun.

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,770
Will you keep listening to this?

181
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,460
Let's go.

182
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,100
Do you know what Reporter Choi was talking about?

183
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,610
He just said that to get your attention. Don't worry about it.

184
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,270
I'm worried he'd come up with a strange story.

185
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,540
Don't worry. I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

186
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,720
How did things go at the expo?

187
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,620
And did the contract with the buyer go well?

188
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,830
We haven't seen each other in four days.

189
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,920
You won't even thank me or ask me how I am, but discuss work right away?

190
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,770
Your face tells me you're fine.

191
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,400
How does my face look?

192
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,390
It looks ugly.

193
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,920
Geez.

194
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,260
You definitely said I was handsome when you came to scout me.

195
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,130
I can say anything when I'm trying to pursue someone.

196
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,740
Geez...

197
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,260
I shouldn't be laughing right now,

198
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,670
but I can't help it.

199
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,500
It's been a while since I've seen you like this.

200
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,220
I don't get what you're saying.

201
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,280
What has been a while?

202
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
Never mind.

203
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,250
Just one second.

204
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,110
Hi, Dad.

205
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,060
You're near the office?

206
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,200
What brings you here without notice?

207
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,710
Yeah.

208
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,670
Dad.

209
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey.

210
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,000
Your office is nice and spacious.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
Is this your first time?

212
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,100
I should've shown you around sooner.

213
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,010
It's okay. It would just be distracting you.

214
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,760
Did I make you come back when you were busy?

215
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,530
Not at all. Have you eaten?

216
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,860
Let's go out if you haven't.

217
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,370
I already ate.

218
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,200
I came to Seoul to run an errand and wanted to see you briefly before I left.

219
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,010
- Why don't you sit down for some tea— 
- No, it's okay.

220
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,320
Hey. It feels like you're higher up than it seems outside.

221
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,760
The ground seems so far away.

222
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,370
My daughter.

223
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,920
You must've been through a lot to get here.

224
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,040
I did it because I wanted to.

225
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,700
Yes.

226
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,270
I thought this was how it should be.

227
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,750
Doing what you really like,

228
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,230
meeting a nice person, and starting a family.

229
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,230
I thought achieving your dreams one by one

230
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,480
would make you happy.

231
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,980
I thought you'd forget everything without dwelling on the past.

232
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,560
Dad, I'm happy.

233
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,120
I mean it.

234
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,060
Jae Won.

235
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,840
No, no, no, no, no.

236
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,380
No, no.

237
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,190
No.

238
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,660
I came to learn about this medicine.

239
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,540
I looked it up, and they say it's used to treat bipolar disorder.

240
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,060
Do you take this yourself?

241
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,640
No, my wife does.

242
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,780
I see.

243
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,240
I can't tell you unless you take it yourself.
  Sagye Neuropsychiatry

244
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,600
Doctor.

245
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,900
Well, I thought that was just her personality at first.

246
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,290
I'm sure she was stressed because the work was demanding.

247
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,940
And I thought it was natural because of that.

248
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,650
But I don't think it is.

249
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,920
She showed up as a completely different person.

250
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,260
As if she doesn't remember anything.

251
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,170
I can't help her unless she's here herself.

252
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,930
Make sure to come back with your wife.

253
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,690
Doctor, I think she's been taking this for a while now.

254
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,490
I've seen her taking it for over a decade.

255
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,000
She doesn't express it when she's struggling or experiencing pain.

256
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,670
But I'm her spouse, Doctor.

257
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,650
I could know about it, right?

258
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,530
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,570
Okay, then.

260
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,600
Her condition...

261
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
might be worsening now.

262
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,130
She might need to be hospitalized and go through intense treatment.

263
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,700
Geez. Look at this mess. Look at it.

264
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,130
Where's Ah Rin?

265
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,660
She's not done with kindergarten yet.

266
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
She'll probably get off around two.

267
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,170
What? Didn't you pick her up?

268
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,520
It's past seven right now.

269
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,310
What are you talking about?

270
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,370
Where did the time go?

271
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,510
And when did I get so many calls?

272
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,510
You're driving me crazy.

273
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,110
How could you be so out of it?

274
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,820
You're a workaholic.

276
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,420
 What? Don't you have an appetite?

277
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,040
 It's too crowded here. I feel a bit suffocated.

278
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,090
 You've been wanting to come here. It was hard to get a reservation.

279
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,880
 You're acting so weird.

280
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,930
 Seriously, why are you doing this?

281
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,440
 What are you thinking about, exactly?

282
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,760
 How long do I have to tolerate your mood swings?

283
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,090
 I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

284
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,520
 I really want you to learn what it's like to live in hell.

285
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,760
 You cut your wrist with a knife?

286
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,390
 The kids won't stop bullying and mocking me.

287
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,610
 They say I'm a lunatic.

288
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,110
 She opened her eyes.

289
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,180
 Are you okay?

290
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,930
 Yun Jin.

291
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,020
 Where am I?

292
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,500
 You're at the school clinic.

293
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,980
 You passed out.

294
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,930
 Did I?

295
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,450
 Don't you remember?

296
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,850
 What happened to my arm?

297
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,130
 Did I get injured?

298
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,300
 Don't get up. Stay down.

299
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,320
You end up running away again.

300
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,770
You'd better think carefully.

301
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,550
Looking for your daughter's biological father might be bad for you.

302
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,340
I know you can't live without her.

303
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,120
To be blunt,

304
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,130
your wife cheated and created this mess.

305
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,310
 I really didn't know.

306
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,290
 I never even imagined it in my dreams.

307
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,930
 I never thought she wouldn't be yours...

308
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,570
 That's enough.

309
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,810
 Sun Yeong, here...

310
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,030
 Let go. Let go!

311
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,780
 Did you think I'd believe that?

312
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,850
 Did you even feel guilty toward me, even a little bit?

313
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,480
Nam Cheol.

314
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,700
What?

315
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,740
Would I be able to fix this situation?

316
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,310
What do you mean?

317
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,440
Could I...

318
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,310
be forgiven by Jae Won?

319
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,150
What are you doing? Call everyone right now!

320
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,760
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy.

321
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,780
The one you asked for the number?

322
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,980
The one with a nice figure.

323
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,800
- Ji Eun?
 - Yes.

324
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,080
Today's the day, okay?

325
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,090
Hang tight. I'll call her right now.

326
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,260
Tell her I'll get her something really expensive—

327
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,200
Hey! Hey.

328
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,000
Why don't you whisper to each other if you want to be so crude?

329
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,220
- What?
 - Do you own this place?

330
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,230
Are you out of your mind?

331
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,040
You're drunk. You're drunk.

332
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,520
 I'm...

333
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,140
 so sorry.

334
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,400
 I'm so sorry.

335
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,190
Gosh, are you satisfied now?

336
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,210
Ah Rin, Daddy's home.

337
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,720
Heo Ah Rin.

338
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,470
Jae Won.

339
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,120
Seo Jae Won!

340
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,770
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

341
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,730
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

342
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,840
♫  Happy birthday, dear Dad  ♫

343
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,290
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

344
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,570
It's your birthday today.

345
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,650
Blow out the candles, Dad.

346
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,950
Here.

347
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,900
- Mom.
 - Yes.

348
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,040
What's wrong with Dad?

349
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,670
Well...

350
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,290
We must've done too good of a job at hiding.

351
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,170
Don't worry. It's nothing. He's just a bit surprised.

352
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,700
I think Ah Rin's really upset.

353
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,620
We prepared a lot for the surprise party.

354
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,620
This is unlike you. What's wrong?

355
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,260
Honey, what's wrong? Did you get hurt? Did something happen?

356
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,800
 Headache

357
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,360
How long were you going to hide this from me?

358
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,340
- The thing is—
 - I'm your husband.

359
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,050
We've been together for twenty years, Jae Won.

360
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,190
Never mind anyone else. You should've at least told me.

361
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,950
I was torn every day.

362
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,170
But I couldn't muster up the courage.

363
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,080
I thought I should just handle it myself.

364
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,870
I couldn't tell you because it was you.

365
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,650
Because you're my family.

366
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,990
I've been running away from people's attention my whole life,

367
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,100
but I was so afraid you'd look at me that way, too.

368
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,830
I was so afraid I might share the burden with you forever.

369
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,760
I thought you not knowing would be the best for us.

370
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
You did that for us?

371
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,680
What do you mean?

372
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,330
How, exactly?

373
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,980
You thought I could be happy by myself while you were ill?

374
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,590
Did you?

375
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,500
Jae Won, you know, even in this moment,

376
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,760
I wonder if you ever smiled freely once.

377
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,540
I wonder if you felt lonely when we discussed happiness.

378
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,310
Thoughts like that fill my head even at this moment.

379
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,570
It's driving me crazy. But...

380
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,210
how?

381
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,440
How is this for me?

382
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,870
I'm sorry.

383
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,840
I... I didn't even know you were ill.

384
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,150
What have I been doing by myself?

385
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,700
How much do things like this cost?

386
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,410
Can I make good money later if I buy one like this?

387
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,400
Who are you, exactly?

388
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,520
You know my father,

389
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,860
but you seem to be involved with Seo Jae Won, too.

390
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,550
Wait. Didn't you call me because you know?

391
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,760
I wanted to clarify things,

392
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,240
Because I'm not sure...

393
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,850
if I can trust you yet.

394
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,880
That depends on the amount of money.

395
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,380
Because a lot of money can create a trust that wasn't there.

396
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,370
Were you like this with Jae Won, too?

397
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm curious why she kept you close.

398
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,940
With CEO Seo,

399
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,450
you could say she took out a loan from me with a high interest rate.

400
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,950
We have a bit of a history.

401
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,000
Are you interested?

402
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,130
What if I were interested?

403
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,400
Then, we'll have to build trust a bit, too.

404
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,100
Let's keep in touch, Ms. Kwon Yun Jin.

405
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,930
Welcome. I haven't seen you in a while.

406
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,760
Would you like your usual order?

407
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,340
Yes.

408
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,270
I know some reporters.

409
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,760
So, I got all the footage from the launch event seven years ago.

410
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,100
 Launch Event - Second Video_1

411
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,250
 Jang Hyeon Wu

412
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,100
 Eom Gi Won

413
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,050
 VIP List for 2016 Derêve's Launch Event

414
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,060
 Aren't you going to let go?

415
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,860
 I said you can't come in without an invitation.

416
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,090
 I'm a police officer, you bastards.

417
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,830
 Launch Event – Second Video_12

418
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,250
 Launch Event - Second Video_12

419
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,930
How many hours has it been?

420
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,360
I need to go to work tomorrow.

421
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,960
Okay.

422
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,470
Just wait a bit.

423
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,020
Give me a beer.

424
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,900
By the way, was that man over there really a detective?

425
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,290
He brags about how he never gets caught because of his connections.

426
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,630
Hey, you better not associate yourself with him.

427
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,520
He's a bottom-of-the-barrel piece of trash.

428
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,690
Why?

429
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,490
Do you think he's simply a gambling addict?

430
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,090
Does he look alive?

431
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,760
He's basically dead. Dead.

432
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,620
He gambled his soul away a long ago.

433
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,810
What was it?

434
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,800
He started it to pay for his wife's hospital bills. You know that's impossible.

435
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,380
I know. A bastard like that stuffs food pretending to be a human. Doesn't he?

436
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,140
- Beer.
 - No, it's not that.

437
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,590
It's okay. You're right about everything.

438
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,390
This is on the house.

439
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,330
You know Kwon Yun Jin, right?

440
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,900
The daughter of Chairman Kwon of the Yein Foundation.

441
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,430
Do some research on her for me.

442
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,860
That woman from Baek Seung Gyu's apartment?

443
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,400
What about her all of a sudden?

444
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,850
She totally...

445
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,360
reeks of cash. My gosh.

446
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
You requested a driver, right?

447
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,640
 Lee Won Bin, Designer

448
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,810
 Um Gi Won, Dentist

449
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,320
 Dorim Bio: Not a match

450
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,040
 Nam Tae Ju

451
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,430
Should we go for a walk or something?

452
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,950
The weather's good for walks these days.

453
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,930
Or do you want a midnight snack? Something really spicy?

454
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,890
Just accept it, Jae Won.

455
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,580
Sun Yeong was bound to find out someday.

456
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,710
I didn't want him to find out this way.

457
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,470
Weren't you continuously running away all this time thinking that?

458
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,490
It's a great concept.

459
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,760
We're thinking of trying something new

460
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,140
since this is our first art gallery-style showroom.

461
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,020
We're not only displaying the artwork,

462
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,390
but we're also thinking of incorporating the paintings into the furniture design pattern.

463
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,690
We could be more daring with colors and patterns, too, then.

464
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:40,320
Yes. Be as free as possible so it can make the space pop.

465
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,180
Got it.

466
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,180
- By the way, Jae Won.
 - Yes?

467
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,380
Is something wrong?

468
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,420
You seem kind of down today.

469
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,640
No.

470
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,080
What? Is it something you can't tell me?

471
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,930
Is it a family matter?

472
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,610
It's not like that.

473
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,970
Sun Yeong found out about my illness.

474
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,250
I see.

475
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,390
How did that happen?

476
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,380
Let's talk later, Yun Jin.

477
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,640
I think I need a bit of time for now.

478
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,580
Okay.

479
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,980
I shouldn't be nosy with your marriage.

480
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,010
By the way, Jae Won,

481
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,660
have you ever thought about

482
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:50,440
how your husband also might have a secret he can't share with you?

483
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,810
What do you mean?

484
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,590
People can't always be honest, you know.

485
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,710
Everyone has at least one secret they can't share.

486
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,780
Whether that's an illness, the past they want to hide,

487
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,780
or whatever it is.

488
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,210
I'm just saying that's how it is.

489
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,690
I heard the test results were great this time.

490
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,210
Of course. We spent a fortune on it.

491
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,060
I'm sure we'll get the FDA approval soon.

492
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,840
You should try investing if you can afford it.

493
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,230
Invest? In what...

494
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,910
You mean, Derêve?

495
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,450
What kind of reaction is that?

496
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,430
I heard they're preparing for something now,

497
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,580
but why do you support CEO Seo so much?

498
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,530
Is she that useful a horse for you?

499
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,070
That...

500
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,830
entirely depends on the owner.

501
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,340
Depending on the fodder and the training,

502
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,060
the horse...

503
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,680
can change anytime.

504
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,270
Welcome back, CEO.

505
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,470
- Where's Ah Rin?
 - She's sleeping in the room.

506
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,140
Professor Heo said he'd be a bit late tonight.

507
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,490
Okay.

508
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,190
 Knock, knock.

509
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,910
You sleepy head.

510
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,260
Ah Rin, Mom is here.

511
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,990
Wake up and have dinner. Wake up.

512
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,150
Here. Let me see.

513
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,720
What's wrong, Ah Rin? Get up.

514
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,460
Get up. What's wrong, Ah Rin?

515
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,670
Mom.

516
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,440
What? What?

517
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,130
Are you sick? Why are you crying?

518
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,640
Are you and Dad getting divorced?

519
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,960
Will we no longer live together?

520
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,300
That's not true.

521
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,150
That's not true. I'm serious, Ah Rin.

522
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,070
You mean it, right?

523
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,140
Ye Won lied to me, right?

524
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,310
She said her mom told her that.

525
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:24,290
That you and Dad are getting divorced.

526
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,240
It's not like that, Ah Rin. Stop crying.

527
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,920
Stop crying. It's not like that, Ah Rin.

528
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,390
 Seo Jae Won divorce

529
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:54,980

530
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,610
 Father,

531
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:09,490
 does acting like someone else have to do with this illness?

532
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,400
 They said she has dissociative amnesia.

533
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,490
 We found out when she was 15.

534
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,550
Do you mean this isn't the first time it has happened?

535
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,570
They said it might've happened before then, too.

536
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,420
They said she might've experienced something similar

537
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,890
because of the childhood trauma from her mom.

538
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,740
What am I supposed to do, then, Father?

539
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,860
They said she needs to minimize stress as much as possible.

540
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,460
By the way, Sun Yeong, what happened to her, exactly?

541
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,540
Sun Yeong. You should've come in. Why are you out here?

543
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,880
I thought I made it clear.

544
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,420
Why are you still doing this?

545
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,290
- What do you mean? 
- Why are you still hanging around Jae Won?

546
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,050
I signed an artist contract with Derêve.

547
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,450
Do you think you have the right to do that?

548
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,290
- What?
 - Right now, Jae Won...

549
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,560
It doesn't mean it never happened

550
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,190
because Jae Won doesn't show it.

551
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,740
It's not that she's not showing it.

552
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,120
More like she doesn't know

553
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,840
because she has no recollection of it. Am I wrong?

554
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,500
I've seen it before.

555
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,110
She turned into a different person overnight because she lost her memory.

556
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,690
What is it that you want?

557
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,060
I don't want anything.

558
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,060
I understand you're angry with me

559
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,320
and confused because of Jae Won, too.

560
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,950
So, Sun Yeong,

561
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,990
let's not make any decisions now and take some time off.

562
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,730
Let's take a break and think it through.

563
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,310
No.

564
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,850
It won't go the way you want.

565
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,980
Go ahead and check.

566
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,900
 Sun Yeong

567
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,030
 Father.

568
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,740
 I need you to help me.

569
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,310
 S-Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

570
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,660
 It couldn't be helped because

571
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,980
 he threatened to kill us both.

572
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,520
 I... I need you to help me, Father.

573
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,130
Sun Yeong. Listen to me.

574
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,150
From now on,

575
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,520
you'd better not do anything to Jae Won.

576
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,310
Otherwise,

577
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,820
I don't know what I might do with this.

578
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,480
Understand?

579
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,560
 I guess I'm...

580
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,170
 very sensitive these days.

581
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,510
- Hey.
  - Hey, Jae Won. Where are you?

582
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,490
I'm at home.

583
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,060
 What for? Is something going on at home?

584
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,860
No, I just wanted to rest a bit.

585
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,290
 This is great. I'm near your house after running an errand.

586
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,710
 Do you want to meet me for a second?

587
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,000
You're near my house?

588
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,740
Hello.

589
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,380
Ah Rin's kindergarten is near here.

590
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,960
Oh, really?

591
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,470
I didn't know her kindergarten was so close by.

592
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,280
Yun Jin.

593
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,150
What did you mean when you said that last time?

594
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,780
You said my husband might have a secret he can't share.

595
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,750
Oh, that?

596
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,440
I didn't really mean anything.

597
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,250
They say even married couples don't always

598
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,710
know what each other is thinking.

599
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,210
What? Did you misunderstand what I said?

600
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,050
No, it's not that.

601
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,970
Are you having an issue with Sun Yeong, then?

602
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,380
I saw a weird article.

603
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,160
It said we were getting divorced.

604
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,110
And they mentioned a design being leaked, too.

605
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,530
Was there an article like that?

606
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,480
I think it's a ridiculous rumor, but it kind of bothers me.

607
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,050
It's not unusual for reporters to write whatever they want.

608
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,840
Don't worry so much.

609
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,230
Okay.

610
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,570
 She might not accept it as reality even after reading an article.

611
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,840
 Rather than accepting a painful truth,

612
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,080
 pretending it never happened and ignoring it

613
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,010
 might be easier immediately. So she might not remember

614
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,830
 to subconsciously protect herself

615
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,210
 by maintaining false serenity on the outside.

616
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:41,130
 But a small memory from the past might trigger

617
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,470
 her memories from the past.

618
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,650
 But it differs case by case.

619
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,610
Jae Won, do you remember when we were in middle school?

620
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,530
What made you suddenly bring that up?

621
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,650
Just because. Don't you remember?

622
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,780
Of course I do.

623
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,590
You and I always drew together and hung out.

624
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,990
I heard our art teacher still works for the school.

625
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,010
I wonder if they still have the drawings we did.

626
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,120
We graduated a long time ago.

627
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,750
But still. You never know.

628
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,060
Should we go look for them?

629
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,640
No.

630
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,300
Ah Rin will be done with kindergarten soon. Sun Yeong will be worried, too.

631
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,670
The old drawings might give us new ideas,

632
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,510
and it'd lift up your mood, too.

633
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,470
Let me try calling Sun Yeong.

634
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,380
Gosh, no need to call him and all that.

635
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,130
Let's just go real quick before you change your mind.

636
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,610
Let's go.

637
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,710
Let's go to school like the old days and get tasty food, too.

638
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,320
This really takes me back.

639
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,630
Did you make good use of the file you took?

640
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,900
Yes. Thank you.

641
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,980
I have a question for you.

642
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,350
By chance...

643
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,830
do you know who this person is?

644
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,950
Only his information was missing from the list.

645
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,320
He's Kwon Yun Jin's ex.

646
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,020
Kim Sang Beom.

647
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,440
Kwon Yun Jin attempted suicide seven years ago.

648
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,590
She seemed devastated after she broke up with the man she loved.

649
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,460
Could it have something to do with that?

650
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,290
She really seemed to be on edge then.

651
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,410
 Yun Jin!

652
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,660
 Yes, Jae Won. Remember it.

653
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,910
What's wrong?

654
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,800
No, it's nothing.

655
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,030
Let's go to the art studio.

656
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,510
Okay.

657
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,020
This is crazy.

658
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,920
Is it somewhere here...

659
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,320
Huh? Here they are.

660
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,510
- They are?
 - Yes.

661
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,500
Really?

662
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,200
This is so crazy. How do they have these?

663
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,610
Look, this is mine.

664
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,320
Wow.

665
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,930
You were good then, too.

666
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,510
Yours must be here, too.

667
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,820
Look. I found it.

668
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,360
It's not as good in comparison.

669
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,020
You were very good from the beginning.

670
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,640
 Name: Seo Yun Jin

671
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,030
Seo Yun Jin.

672
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,950
Yes.

673
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,570
Even our names were the same then.

674
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,570
 I don't need this.

675
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,270
 I heard you're transferring.

676
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,290
 Where are you going?

677
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,850
 Is it a secret?

678
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,230
 I'll...

679
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,190
 change my name, too.

680
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,230
 To what?

681
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,110
 Seo Jae Won.

682
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,610
 Seo Jae Won?

683
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,610
 Take care.

684
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,740
 Jae Won.

685
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,440
 Have you heard of the Yein Scholarship Foundation?

686
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,810
 They help the students who want to draw.

687
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,180
 Let us...

688
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,380
 draw together.

689
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,290
What happened to the 15-year-old girl who was timid about drawing

690
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,150
and became a CEO?

691
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,990
Because you were there.

692
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:57,870
Sun Yeong was a very good partner for me,

693
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,030
but you were there before him.

694
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:09,540
If you hadn't lent me your gym clothes then,

695
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,730
if you hadn't told me to paint on this canvas,

696
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,380
and if you hadn't introduced me to the Yein Foundation,

697
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,340
I might not be where I am today.

698
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,260
That's how kind you were to me.

699
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,530
Thank you, Yun Jin.

700
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,710
Yes.

701
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,990
I'm enjoying my free time.

702
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,110
Take your time.

703
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:51,590
To be honest, I came out to get fresh air.

704
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,930
To get fresh air?

705
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,810
Alone? Where are you?

706
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,620
It's okay. I'll make sure I won't be late.

707
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,150
Just take care of Ah Rin for me.

708
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,010
Okay, then.

709
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,160
Call me if anything happens.

710
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,630
Okay.

711
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,960
Maybe I should've told him I'm with you.

712
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm glad you didn't.

713
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,270
He would be needlessly worried if you said you went far.

714
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:23,010
You needed to spend time like this.

715
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,730

 - Good to see you.

722
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,900
 Good to see you!

723
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,200
 One, two, three.

724
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,930
 Smile. Smile.

727
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,510
Damn.

728
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,650
Seo Yun Jin.

729
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,840
Thank you.

730
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,310
Why do you look so sad?

731
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,630
Is it because of the article you mentioned?

732
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,990
I'm not so sure.

733
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,660
It feels like something's stuck in my chest, but I'm not sure what.

734
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,820
I told you not to worry so much.

735
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,960
It's because you're too successful.

736
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,840
You should've become less famous, then.

737
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,140
Time goes by so fast.

738
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,280
We never imagined it when we were in middle school.

739
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,370
That you and I would end up so differently, like now.

740
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,860
Everything is different from then now.

741
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,980
Your name and the situation changed, too.

742
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,830
The situation might've changed,

743
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,430
but I still feel the same.

744
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:17,100
It felt awkward to give and take when we were young,

745
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,250
but it's different now.

746
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,430
I'll give back as much as I've received from you.

747
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,300
I have already received a lot. More than I can handle.

748
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,890
It's still not enough.

749
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,540
Until everyone acknowledges your talent,

750
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,450
I'll help you a lot more.

751
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,940
I used to...

752
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,820
dream that once.

753
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,460
Why is it in the past tense? It's just getting started.

754
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,660
Because my dream changed.

755
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,790
Really?

756
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,620
What is it?

757
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,810
Don't ask.

758
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,470
Why do you care what an unknown artist dreams of?

759
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,220
Seo Jae Won.

760
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,090
Becoming Seo Jae Won.

761
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,530
You have everything.

762
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,660
What I don't have,

763
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,370
the things I've wanted,

764
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,340
and everything I used to have, too.

767
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,080
 You have a father

768
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,390
and husband who are always...

769
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,930
on your side.

770
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,360
On your and Sun Yeong's wedding day,

771
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,120
you shined so brightly.

772
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:19,190
Seeing you promising to love only each other forever

773
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,430
made me think.

774
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,410
That I also want to...

775
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,060
start a family

776
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,750

I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

794

799
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,270
Honey.

800
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,690
What are you doing here?

801
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,180
Well, I—

802
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,120
Professor Heo.

803
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,010
What brings you here?

804
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:28,220
Well, I came to meet Professor Heo.

805
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,120
I wanted to ask for design advice.

806
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,440
I didn't know you two saw each other behind my back.

807
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,160
Well, it just happened, so...

808
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,190
What about Ah Rin?

809
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:43,180
I asked the nanny to watch her.

810
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:48,500
This is a crazy coincidence. Why don't we all eat together?

811
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,100
Have a seat, Professor Heo.

812
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,360
You should sit, too, Te Oh.

813
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,280
I still can't get over how strange this is.

814
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,530
How could all of us run into each other here?

815
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,550
As if someone planned it.

816
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,360
It's because I made them come here.

817
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,930
I recently recommended this restaurant to Te Oh.

818
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,830
Right?

819
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,040
Yes. You're right.

820
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,380
I thought it was meant to be when Te Oh said

821
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,730
Derêve recruited him.

822
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:32,540
He was so obsessed with Seo Yun Jin.

823
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,130
You ended up meeting her like this.

824
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,610
Seo Yun Jin?

825
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,910
How do you know my old name?

826
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:46,590
Well, I've been interested in Derêve since before you recruited me.

827
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,940
So I asked Seonbae about you.

828
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,380
And I ended up learning that name, too.

829
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,560
Stop lying.

830
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,360
I know you like her. Don't you?

831
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,720
Kwon Yun Jin.

832
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,140
You're taking your joke too far.

833
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,590
Did you really not know?

834
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,570
Are you sure you weren't playing ignorant?

835
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,080
Has your heart never really fluttered?

836
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,310
That's enough, Seonbae.

837
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,270
Why are you all like this? It's no fun.

838
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,190
Why don't we try to be honest?

839
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:35,580
How could anyone only love one person their whole life?

840
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,230
Don't you agree, Professor Heo?

841
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,730
Why are you doing this?

842
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,480
You're giving Sun Yeong the wrong impression.

843
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,130
Yun Jin is just feeling sentimental today.

844
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,670
I hope you understand, Honey.

845
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,430
I hope you understand, too, Team Leader Yun.

846
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,150
Okay.

847
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,600
Professor Heo.

848
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,730
I'm not sure if you know,

849
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:12,310
but I've been very jealous of Jae Won for a long time.

850
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:17,010
I want to marry a kind man like you

851
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,970
and have a pretty daughter like Ah Rin, too.

852
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,530
But I noticed something last time.

853
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:30,330
They say daughters usually resemble their dads.

854
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,590
But Ah Rin doesn't seem to resemble you.

855
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,310
Don't you think?

856
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,570
What are you talking about?

857
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,280
Her nose and mouth are exactly like his.

858
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,430
I know.

859
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:54,060
You don't know because you never got a proper look at Ah Rin.

860
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,610
Ah Rin resembles me a lot.

861
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,940
That's not true.

862
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,360
I got a good look.

863
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:15,030

864
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:24,830
♫  What would it have been like if we hadn't become like this?  ♫

865
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:28,670
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

866
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,610
♫  it's scattered through the empty darkness  ♫

867
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:37,850
♫  I wanna know  ♫

868
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,420
♫  You blow in  ♫

869
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:47,780
♫  I wanna know  ♫

870
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,760
♫  I'm not okay. I can't feel your touch  ♫

871
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,560
♫  In the wave of memory surging over the end  ♫

872
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,530
♫  I'm not okay. I can't hear your voice  ♫

873
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:05,590
♫  I picture us who are only in my dream  ♫

874
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:13,230
♫  On the truth which is harsh, the aborted ending,  ♫

875
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:17,260
 My Happy Ending

876
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,750
 Would you be able to handle it if I get all of my memory back?

877
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,250
 Who should I bring this to get an appropriate deal?

878
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,390
 What's your intention?

879
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,170
 Why are you so obsessed with Jae Won?

880
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,310
 I knew it.

881
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,460
 How could you do that with Jae Won's friend?

882
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,900
 I haven't even started anything crazy yet.

883
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,830
 I'm curious to see Jae Won's face.

884
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,790
 Why did you do that to that woman?

885
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,850
 Tell me! Tell me!

886
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:44,610
 I don't think anyone around you would tell you the truth right now.

887
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:48,180
 Ms. Seo Jae Won, you're under arrest without a warrant on a charge of murder.

888
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,970
 Are you kneeling in front of me because of Seo Jae Won?

889
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,950
 Are you out of your mind?
