 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents,
and situations in this drama are fictitious.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,050
I was wrong.

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm very sorry.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,710
I wasn't thinking clearly.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,870
It's all my fault.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,640
Please forgive me just once.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,560
Let me protect my family. Forgive me just this once.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm sorry, Yun Jin.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,490
Are you...

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,270
kneeling in front of me because of Seo Jae Won?

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,290
 Are you doing this because you want to see me go insane?

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,020
 Do you really? Do you?

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,280
 Do you think you could be forgiven for what you did by doing this?

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,510
 Do you think by doing this only you two can become happy?

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,170
No.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,960
If I can't have it,

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,080
no one can.

25
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,420
 Is it because you have that stupid audio file? Go ahead.

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,230
 Who would get hurt more if everything were to be revealed?

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,940
 Wouldn't Seo Jae Won get hurt more than me?

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,220
Please keep this safe for me.

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,030
Huh? What's this?

30
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,800
Is something going on with you?

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,030
No, not at all.

32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,850
I'll pick it up when it's time. Bye.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,240
Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,130
What is this, exactly? Huh?

35
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:46,310

36
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,240
What? Who are you?

37
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,490
In the end,

38
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,600
you ended up this way, my Sun Yeong.

 My Happy Ending

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,940
 Episode 14

41
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,630
You came.

42
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,040
Long time no see, Seung Gyu.

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,550
How are you feeling?

44
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,520
Is anyone there? Hello?

45
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,840
There's no one to save you.

46
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,410
There's no point in screaming like that, I mean.

47
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,190
I find it to be a shame you ended up this way,

48
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,050
but as you know, it was an accident.

49
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,870
If you come with me willingly,

50
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,900
I'll compensate you fully.

51
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,340
You told me once that you wanted to go somewhere far away.

52
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,190
I'll help you with that.

53
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,950
Do you think I'd believe what you say?

54
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,350
You have to.

55
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you think you doing this

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,940
would make you remotely as good as Ms. Seo?

57
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,550
- What?
 - I know why you're doing this.

58
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,300
You came this far because of how you feel about her.

59
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,020
Insecurity.

60
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,880
Because of that low and dark insecurity, you dragged me into this, didn't you?

61
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,110
Go on, Seung Gyu.

62
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,530
But you can't become Ms. Seo even if you dress like her and steal her position...

63
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,570
because you're just Kwon Yun Jin.

64
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Excuse me.

65
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,770
- You can't.
 - No!

66
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,020
- Don't look.
 - Te Oh, Te Oh, is that Seung Gyu?

67
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Te Oh! Is that Seung Gyu?

68
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,730
- T-Te Oh!
 - CEO.

69
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,270
Yun Te Oh!

70
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,760
CEO.

71
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,150
I'm sorry.

72
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,680
Go upstairs.

73
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,990
 For the one who's hesitating / My Santiago

74
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,190
Yes, Seonbae. Nam Tae Ju isn't here.

75
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,070
Hello.

76
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,260
You probably need to rest more.

77
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,760
Are you sure you'll be okay?

78
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,180
Someone just died.

79
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,300
Let's try piecing things together.

80
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,150
Nam Tae Ju told you where Baek Seung Gyu was.

81
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,820
So, you went there and talked to him,

82
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,490
but Nam Tae Ju suddenly barged in and killed Mr. Baek.

83
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,520
And he tried to kill you, too. Is that correct?

84
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,600
- Yes.
 - Why did you go see Mr. Baek?

85
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,610
I just wanted to have a conversation.

86
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,480
Let's talk about the motive.

87
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,050
Coincidentally, something similar happened when you visited Mr. Baek last time.

88
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,640
I think Mr. Baek...

89
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,210
must've felt threatened by just seeing you.

90
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,260
Are you...

91
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,440
suspecting me right now?

92
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,650
Can you say that after seeing me like this?

93
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,360
When I think about all the threats I got from Nam Tae Ju...

94
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,830
Nam Tae Ju...

95
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,340
He tried to kill both Seung Gyu and me

96
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,240
to cover up everything he's done so far.

97
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,160
Can't you tell, Detective?

98
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,440
Oh, I see.

99
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,090
Seung Gyu... 
  Baek Seung Gyu 1993.02.15

100
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,480
I should've been by your side.

101
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,270
How dare you show up here?

102
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,890
How dare you show up here?

103
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,370
I came because I felt guilty that I couldn't stop it.

104
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,200
Do you really mean it?

105
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,590
I mean it.

106
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,110
Kwon Yun Jin.

107
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,330
No secret lasts forever.

108
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,990
I'm leaving.

109
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,560
The fingerprints from the kitchen knife turned out to be Nam Tae Ju's.

110
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,350
I checked the transaction history, too.

111
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,050
As Ms. Kwon said, he received more than one billion won.

112
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,440
How about his whereabouts? Does he have an alibi?

113
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,730
He was captured on the CCTV near the scene on the night of the incident.

114
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,550
He's nowhere to be found currently.

115
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,370
No way.

116
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,090
Did Nam Tae Ju really...

117
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,460
The evidence is pointing at him. What can we do?

118
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,860
Why did he leave the only evidence at the scene?

119
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,080
H-How dare you talk to me like that?

120
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,370
- What will you do about it?
 - So what if you're older?

121
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,990
You should've used the turn signal if you were on the right.

122
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,500
- You cut me off first! 
 - Is that how you drive?

123
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,190
Gosh, seriously.

124
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,140
- Can't you drive properly?
 - How dare you talk casually?

125
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,810
- Can't you?
 - Who cares if you're older?

126
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,420
I care.

127
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,400
Yes.

128
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,820
He doesn't gamble or anything like that.

129
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,780
No, I really had no idea.

130
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,230
Did everything go well?

131
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,570
What do we do?

132
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,490
Shouldn't we talk to Jae Won?

133
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,450
No.

134
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,860
Don't you try to call her.

135
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,770
Unbelievable. Stop worrying about your daughter and worry about yourself, Oppa.

136
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,910
She's the only one who can help you.

137
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,050
Don't be ridiculous.

138
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,630
Will you spend the rest of your life in prison?

139
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,140
They said murder!

140
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,480
 Hand me the evidence you have.

141
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,050
 What are you talking about? What evidence?

142
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,880
 I'm sure you left evidence while cleaning up after...

143
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,760
 Kwon Yeong Ik and Kwon Yun Jin.

144
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,790
 You knew I'd come,

145
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,470
 but you don't know the reason.

146
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,030
 You're disposable, too, after all.

147
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,690
 You'll be disposed of too.

148
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,900
 Come to me, then.

149
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,060
 2023 Investigation report for Baek Seung Gyu's fall incident

150
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,020
Is it tasty?

151
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,190
You look better since you're on a leave.

152
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,990
What brings you here?

153
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,510
You heard about Nam Tae Ju, right?

154
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes. Well...

155
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,950
Tell me...

156
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,780
what happened when you were on the Baek Seung Gyu case

157
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,150
if you don't want to lose your job immediately.

158
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,370
I'll get going now.

159
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,210
Come on. Don't do anything silly.

160
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,480
If I tell you right now,

161
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,980
I'll no longer be a part of it, right?

162
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,050
Were you ever? Sit down.

163
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,060
Seonbae Nam knew...

164
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,560
Kwon Yun Jin pushed him but tried to cover it up. He said nothing would happen.

165
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes, he covered it up.

166
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,090
But why would he kill him?

167
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,810
- Pardon?
 - Why did he have a falling out with Kwon Yun Jin?

168
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,620
Well, I don't know much about it.

169
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,530
But it seemed Seonbae Nam and Kwon Yun Jin were pretty close.

170
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,060
You can reach Nam Tae Ju, right?

171
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,590
I tried contacting him already, but his phone is off.

172
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,870
Let me know if you hear from him.

173
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,160
Where are you going?

174
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,710
We'll discuss your future extensively after this is done.

175
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,780
You're prepared for it, right?

176
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,220
Shit.

177
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,930
I found this while doing research on Nam Tae Ju.

178
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,530
 A gambling group of 15 people, including a police officer, were arrested

179
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,420
What's wrong?

180
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,820
I see another familiar face.

181
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,440
Who is it?

182
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,800
My mom.

183
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,350
 Evidence No. 9

184
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,970
 Evidence No. 2

185
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,690
I swear I was just watching.

186
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,950
It was my first time day, okay?

187
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,840
- I really didn't do it.
 - You did.

188
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,200
I swear I didn't.

189
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,950
You can't smoke in here. No smoking.

190
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,240
Aigoo.

191
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,470
How impressive. Seriously. 
  Criminal record

192
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,260
Why do you gamble?

193
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,170
Do you really think you can win money?

194
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,150
Do you know who Seo Jae Won is?

195
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,330
Who's that?

196
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,280
Look her up if you're curious.

197
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,820
 Seo Jae Won

198
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,980
She's

199
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,640
my daughter.

200
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,350
Excuse me.

201
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,520
You need to come back when you receive the notice of attendance.

202
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,500
Otherwise, I'll come to you with a warrant.

203
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,460
What's that?

204
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,440
Stop by to elevate your mood.

205
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,550
 The police are searching for Nam, a man in his 40s who murdered a man in his 30s

206
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,070
Did they have to use this photo? 
 The police are searching for Nam, a man in his 40s who murdered a man in his 30s

207
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,080
Would people recognize me?

208
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,590
Hello, sir.

209
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,820
Yes, hello.

210
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,310
You've been here for a long time.

211
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,150
- I have a lot to think about. 
- I see.

212
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,760
I used to come here often with my wife.

213
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,970
It's a nice spot.

214
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,320
Oh, I see.

215
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,070
Were you able to sort out your thoughts?

216
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,940
I'm still deliberating.

217
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,620
I'll leave you to it, then.

218
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,790
I hope you catch a lot.

219
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,360
I'm deliberating on...

220
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,450
whether I should kill or let go.

221
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,000
 Today's topic of Hot Issue Today is

222
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,640
 related to Seo Jae Won, who left the mental institution recently.

223
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,010
 We'll be talking about her father, Seo Chang Seok specifically.

224
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,260
 Would you believe me if I said

225
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,260
 he murdered his wife, using pesticide, to get insurance money?

226
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,890
 We'll delve into this shocking story...

227
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:19,400
It's a scoop you'll be quite interested in.

228
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,430
 But I get to decide when to release it.

229
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,190
 According to the information I acquired secretly,

230
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,630
 Mr. Seo Chang Seok was arrested this morning.

231
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,490
 This case was revealed thanks to Hot Issue Today's quick investigation...

232
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,050
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

233
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,420
Let's go to your father right now.

234
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,710
No, I won't go.

235
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,680
What are you saying? Didn't you see the article?

236
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,580
I did. I watched Reporter Choi's YouTube video, too.

237
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,900
You should go right now, then. Aren't you worried about your father?

238
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,760
He hasn't contacted me the entire time he was being questioned.

239
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,280
He doesn't want me to come.

240
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,440
How can you be sure about that?

241
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,760
Because I was like that.

242
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,070
Attorney, did you arrive safely?

243
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,330
 Yes, I did.

244
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,460
How's my dad doing?

245
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,150
 He's enduring it well.

246
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,090
That's a relief.

247
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,340
Tell him I'm enduring it well, too.

248
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,360
And we'll see each other in good health soon.

249
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,780
Please take good care of him.

250
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,210
Okay, I will. Don't worry.

251
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,820
I'm relieved that...

252
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,620
you look better than I expected.

253
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,630
How is...

254
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,670
your mom doing?

255
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,080
She's doing well.

256
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,760
By the way, I'm surprised.

257
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,380
You know how to ask how someone's doing.

258
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,060
There was an article recently.

259
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,390
Do you know, by chance?

260
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,960
- Did you do it?
 - Gosh.

261
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm so disappointed.

262
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,210
I don't expect you to worry,

263
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,020
but should you be asking your daughter if she's the culprit?

264
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,540
Yes, Father.

265
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,810
I did it.

266
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,460
Telling you like this...

267
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,990
makes me feel so much better.

268
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,320
What are you planning to do?

269
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,840
Will you be able to handle it?

270
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,370
Well, not much can be done.

271
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,320
This is what you've been creating for the past 43 years.

272
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,560
Don't look at me like that.

273
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,280
Make sure to pay attention...

274
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,420
and see how I end up.

275
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,330
I think this will be the last time visiting you...

276
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,360
Father.

277
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,730
Did you find Nam Tae Ju?

278
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,210
He's gone missing since that night.

279
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,900
He'll be showing up soon.

280
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,870
He's not someone who'll stay quiet.

281
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,060
Well, how was your visit?

282
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,480
It went well.

283
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,160
You must care since you've worked for Father for so long.

284
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,300
I changed a lot, didn't I?

285
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,220
I think you must have a reason for it.

286
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,010
Yes.

287
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,800
Yes.

288
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,320
I always feel bad and grateful for you, Yun Je.

289
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,680
 Black Joker

290
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,690
Nam Tae Ju.

291
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,560
- What's this?
 - Gosh, I'm sorry.

292
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,780
Shit.

293
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,000
You're meeting Nam Tae Ju here, right?

294
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,440
Gosh, why are you doing this to me?

295
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,710
I don't know.

296
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,140
Can't you see I'm also desperately looking for him so I can survive?

297
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,000
Is there another place he might be?

298
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,310
I don't think I can come for a while.

299
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,720
Just so you know.

300
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,990
 Jeong Mi Yeon

301
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,710
I knew I'd run into you here at least once.

302
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
I'll think you did it if you run away now.

303
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,040
Did you do it?

304
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,670
Would you believe me if I said no?

305
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,970
You kept your word with Eonni.

306
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,820
That's why you're here now.

307
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,390
Did Kwon Yun Jin do it, then?

308
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,730
Why are you asking if you know?

309
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,830
Why were you there that night, then?

310
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,420
Why do you think I went there?

311
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,380
To collect the rest of the payment.

312
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,170
Come, Nam Tae Ju.

313
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,790
Are you serious right now?

314
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,240
Let go.

315
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,890
Hey, Nam Tae Ju!

316
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,410
 010-046-4899

317
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,810
 I became disposable goods, as you said.

318
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,160
You must've called me for a reason.

319
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,450
Don't you want to catch Kwon Yun Jin?

320
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,130
Should a murderer be saying that?

321
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,880
Don't be like that.

322
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,650
You're humoring me since you also suspect that

323
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,350
Kwon Yun Jin was behind all this.

324
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,820
How am I supposed to believe you?

325
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,280
Will you believe me if I give you what you want?

326
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,400
How do you know what that is?

327
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,350
What actually happened that day.

328
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,290
That day?

329
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,360
I'm waiting for you.

330
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,060
Help me!

331
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,550
You might as well die.

332
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,230
Help me...

333
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,830
You should die for Jae Won's sake.

334
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,450
Die.

335
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,240
17:05, December 17, 2016.

336
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,440
Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang has passed.

337
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,170
We contacted the police since we couldn't determine her cause of death.

338
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,270
They'll be here soon. Please wait a moment.

339
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,220
- The police? 
- Yes.

340
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,000
We'll need an autopsy to find out the cause.

341
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,360
Well, she suffered a lot since she had a bad heart.

342
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,970
She said she felt dizzy and nauseated recently,

343
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,580
but because I just overlooked it.

344
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,070
I don't feel good about cutting open a dead person.

345
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,560
Please explain it to the police when they come.

346
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,980
It's a complicated situation.

347
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,510
If Nam Tae Ju definitely had a falling out with Kwon Yun Jin

348
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,880
and has evidence,

349
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,030
shouldn't we acquire that first?

350
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,200
I don't think we should just wait like this.

351
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Dad's trial comes first.

352
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,610
- Pardon?
 - Kwon Yun Jin wants me to get defeated by the trial

353
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,160
because it'd be game over if he were found guilty.

354
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,250
She won't act rashly since Nam Tae Ju showed up

355
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:01,190
because she's the one he's after, not me.

356
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,140
Since she understands the situation well.

357
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,690
She'll definitely show up before the trial ends.

358
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,300
Apparently, someone recently saw Nam Tae Ju near there.

359
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,680
I'll check and take care of things.

360
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,110
No, it's not time yet.

361
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,580
I need to check what Nam Tae Ju has first.

362
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,060
We'll find the evidence first and take care of things afterward.

363
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,730
You know what I mean, right?

364
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,730
Yes.

365
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,590
Good work.

366
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,180
Don't mention it.

367
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,250
I'm sure he'll approach Seo Jae Won.

368
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,060
 She said she'd pay me more than you.

369
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,850
 She said, "There's no way you didn't leave evidence while cleaning up."

370
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,880
 Supreme Court Decision for the Lettuce Pesticide Case

371
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,960
The 30th...

372
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,220
Here you go.

373
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,140
Thank you.

374
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,550
I'll take it in a moment.

375
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,450
I told you to let the attorney take care of it.

376
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,700
I just feel anxious.

377
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,000
The trial is all about whether your father intended murder.

378
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,640
Even if it were true that he didn't rescue her immediately,

379
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,850
 he didn't think she'd die immediately

380
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,930
 and it won't be considered intentional if it was a reasonable belief.

381
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,020
I'll focus on that and argue that he didn't intend to kill her.

382
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,170
If so,

383
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,250
what do you think I should do?

384
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,530
We need objective evidence or testimony to prove that

385
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,720
she threatened him by taking pesticide below the lethal dose three times

386
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,310
while she was addicted to gambling.

387
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,010
What if I testify?

388
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,000
That's definitely an option,

389
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,570
but the court trusts testimony from an objective third party more than from the family.

390
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,780
More importantly,

391
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,630
you've been hospitalized at a mental institution.

392
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,600
The prosecution will use that to undercut the credibility of your testimony.

393
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,560
 A housewife was arrested for poisoning her husband to get insurance money

394
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,460
Hold on. I'll read a little longer.

395
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,400
I'll take it in a bit.

396
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,820
- Take the pills.
 - I'll take them later.

397
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,660
I need time to focus right now.

398
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,240
I know you won't take them.

399
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,520
You didn't take them yesterday or the day before, either.

400
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,130
Saving my dad is more important than my condition.

401
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,830
How long do you think you could last in that condition?

402
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,240
Skipping pills a few times won't cause serious issues.

403
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,700
- I just need to overcome this crisis, Te Oh.
 - I know how you feel...

404
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,370
but still, take them.

405
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,400
I said I'll take them later, didn't I?

406
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,390
I still see Su Gyeong even if I take them.

407
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,700
I still see her even if I take the pills, exercise, and try to ignore her.

408
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm her daughter.

409
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,140
But my testimony might be questioned

410
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,070
because of my illness.

411
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,980
I think I'd go crazy if I didn't do this.

412
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,850
You can prove it. You've been doing well thus far.

413
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,090
You're still Seo Jae Won, even if you take medication.

414
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,910
♫  Does it matter after all?  ♫

415

♫  In the time I put off I wonder  ♫

416
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,480
Please take a closer look.

417
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,740
She could've been skinnier than the photo.

418
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,750
- Please look carefully. 
- No, I don't recognize her.

419
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,330
Have a look at this.

420
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,740
Thank you.

421
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,910
Look at the page two. There's the key information.

I'm sorry, Dad.

I'm a bit late, aren't I?

432
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,930
No, not at all.

433
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,940
Wasn't it difficult to get here?

434
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,260
Not at all.

435
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,070
Have you eaten?

436
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,910
I ate.

437
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,360
You're taking your medicine, too?

438
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,450
Yes. I've been taking it every day.

439
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,110
That's good enough.

440
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,780
That's all I need.

441
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,610
What do you mean?

442
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,890
You need to come out soon so you can go fishing with Ah Rin and me.

443
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,640
Ah Rin doesn't know anything, right?

444
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,090
Of course not.

445
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,730
She's doing very well in the US.

446
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,820
That kid.

447
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,060
I wonder if she's forgotten our faces already.

448
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,360
She called and said she misses Grandpa.

449
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,090

I need to tell you something.

454
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,220
Your mom—

455
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,550
Don't say anything in court tomorrow.

456
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,980
Just do what the lawyer tells you to do, okay?

457
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,110
I came to tell you that.

458
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't worry about me and only look after yourself.

459
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,440
Okay?

How does it feel

468

to have to send your father to prison?

469
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,970
It was you, wasn't it?

470
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,320
The one who informed Reporter Choi.

471
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,640
Would that make any difference?

472
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,200
You killed Seung Gyu, too.

473
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,380
You must've heard from Nam Tae Ju.

474
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,350
Do you believe what he says?

475
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,690
I'll just wait and see.

476
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,770
More important than that, why won't you answer me?

477
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,110
I asked how it feels.

478

485
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,670
Criminal Division No. 8 will start the morning trial.

486
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,320
Even though the suspect was required to protect the victim as her husband,

487
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,910
around 16:00 on December 17th, 2016, in the courtyard of his house in Wonjin,

488
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,130
he let the victim die by not rescuing her immediately when she was

489
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:02,380
desperately asking for help after taking a pesticide since he hoped she'd die because

490
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,960
she put them in a financial crisis through frequent gambling.

491
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,120
Therefore, he killed the victim by choosing to let her die.

492
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,060
And he deceived the insurance company by not telling them the victim was poisoned

493
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,320
and received 500 million won in life insurance proceeds.

494
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Therefore, the defendant is charged with murder and insurance fraud.

495
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,650
What is the defendant's plea on the charges?

496
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,700
The defendant admits to committing the insurance fraud,

497
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,520
but he denies committing the murder.

498
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,830
The defendant had no intention to kill.

499
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,260
As explained in the statement submitted,

500
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,260
he thought his wife had taken a pesticide

501
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:49,060
below the lethal dose just to threaten him to demand money as she had done before.

502
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,650
It's true that he was momentarily angry that she repeatedly hurt her family

503
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,520
and didn't rescue her immediately,

504
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,850
but after a moment, he called 911 himself

505
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,030
and she ended up in the ER.

506
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:10,190
Therefore, the defendant had no intention to kill his wife.

507
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,490
What does the defendant think?

508
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,910
Do you agree with your attorney?

509
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,350
Yes.

510
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,450
Is it true the defendant got prescriptions for a

511
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:32,010
mental illness medication for decades for his stepdaughter, Seo Jae Won, since 1995?

512
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,820
Yes.

513
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:41,490
The defendant is used to lying since he's been getting prescriptions for someone else.

514
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,750
And even though he knew the victim had been suffering from nephritis,

515
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,520
he didn't rescue her immediately.

516
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,050
I think it's not very credible that he lacked any intention to kill.

517
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,230
Lastly, Defendant,

518
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,390
did you refuse to get an autopsy for the victim, Jeong Mi Hyang?

519
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,950
 Judge

520
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,190
 Did you know that your father refused to get an autopsy for your mother?

521
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,480
No. I never heard that.

522
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,850
The fact that he refused an autopsy will be a big disadvantage.

523
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,170
Most culprits, indeed, refuse to get autopsies.

524
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,150
We'll have to find a witness to give helpful testimony for him before the next day in court.

525
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,610
 Coffee Shop

526
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,960
Jeong Mi Hyang? I haven't heard that name in ages.

527
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,850
Thinking about how she ran with my money...

528
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,000
You still haven't been paid back by chance?

529
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,370
No, her husband paid me back.

530
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,250
Was it seven years ago?

531
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,990
I demanded money from him aggressively

532
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,780
and he said he'd be able to pay it back soon.

533
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,310
And out of the blue, he paid me five million won.

534
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:29,340
It turns out he got the insurance proceeds after Jeong Mi Hyang died.

535
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,410
I hate to say this, but

536
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,750
I would've hated her enough to want to kill her if she were my wife.

537
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,240
It worked out. He got money out of it, too.

538
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,630
♫  What would it have been like   ♫

539
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,060
 Did you refuse to get an autopsy for the victim, Jeong Mi Hyang?

540
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,750
♫  Even if I try to take it out  ♫

541
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,500
♫  It's scattered through the empty darkness  ♫

542
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,010
 Why didn't you tell me?

543
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,410
 You should've told me.

544
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:09,940
 After you took care of her your whole life?

545
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,920
 When your business was finally taking off

546
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,930
 and you were finally smiling after being freed from her?

547
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,120
♫  I'm not okay  ♫

548
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Okay, got it.

549
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,930
Both people who were in charge are currently abroad.

550
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,920
It'd be hard to reach them since one moved permanently and the other is on sabbatical.

551
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,640
We'll have to find a different solution.

552
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,360
How about you?

553
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,900
CEO?

554
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,600
Yes. Well...

555
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,750
the one I met today won't be a good witness.

556
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,740
Why not?

557
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,810
She said she would've wanted to kill Mom if she were him.

558
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,720
She said she could easily understand Dad.

559
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,730
Why did Dad refuse to get an autopsy?

560
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,520
If he indeed turned his back on her for me,

561
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,640
what am I supposed to do?

562
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,110

572
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,180
I haven't found a witness yet.

573
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,970
Is there a way to delay the trial by chance?

574
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,280
We can.

575
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,220
If a witness can't attend the trial,

576
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,810
you can explain the reason and submit a request for delay.

577
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,000
It's just a temporary solution, right?

578
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,160
What if we let the trial happen without delaying it?

579
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,250
Rather than delaying it, submitting evidence or questioning the witness

580
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,870
would still be better for us.

581
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:20,570
What if we provide various color options other than this?

582
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:26,580
We were thinking of different options, including black with a red edge and white and black.

583
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,890
Where are the samples?

584
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,540
Hold on a second.

585
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,770
What are you doing here?

586
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,790
Did you decide to come back now?

587
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:45,490
Ms. Kwon, I asked Team Leader Yun for help.

588
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,500
I thought it'd be nice to get his feedback.

589
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,520
It's good to get feedback from a professional,

590
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,570
but let's not shift responsibilities, Assistant Manager Choi.

591
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

592
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,410
You can get back to work.

593
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,900
Dong Hun.

594
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,020
How could you act like nothing happened

595
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,690
after doing something so horrifying?

596
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,990
You think it's me whenever something happens, don't you?

597
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,730
Even though I'm the victim.

598
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,460
CEO Seo's trial

599
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,060
won't go the way you want.

600
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,870
I'm looking forward to it.

601
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,590
Call me whenever you want to come back.

602
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,570
I'll welcome you.

603
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:53,370
In the end, you ended up this way, my Sun Yeong.

604
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,560
I did contact the chairman.

605
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,740
Do you think it'll work?

606
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,440
It's already working.

607
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,600
Okay.

608
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,570
This is where I leave you.

609
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,970
Here I go. Bam.

610
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,000
What do I do, Father?

611
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,340
What were you thinking when you did this?

612
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:01,140
Sun Yeong threatened me using the recording of

613
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,060
our phone conversation about Seung Gyu.

614
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,990
He said he'd hurt you, too.

615
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,450
He said your political career would be over, so...

616
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,000
I had no other choice.

617
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,220
It was recorded well, right?

618
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,600
You must believe me now.

619
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,570
That Kwon Yun Jin planned everything.

620
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:45,270
For also participating in my husband's murder

621
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,350
you are the same.

622
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,280
Shouldn't you catch Kwon Yun Jin first?

623
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,150
Think carefully.

624
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,200
To catch Kwon Yun Jin and save your father,

625
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,230
you'll need me.

626
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,200
What do you mean?

627
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,800
I used to gamble with your mother.

628
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,580
I lost all of my assets and caused my wife to die because of Jeong Mi Hyang.

629
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,760
I guess your father didn't tell you.

630
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,450
He does care deeply about his daughter. Seriously.

631
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,500
Call me with this when you decide.

632
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,660
Was it you?

633
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,170
What are you trying to get out of this, exactly?

634
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,850
What were you thinking when you went to see Yun Jin?

635
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:11,510
It was probably to protect your family.

636
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,390
I'm trying to do the same.

637
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,490
So,

638
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,170
hand me the audio recording on Baek Seung Gyu.

639
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:23,250
I'll forget about everything if you just give me that.

640
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,490
Why are you laughing?

641
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,990
I just wonder...

642
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,080
if I'm different from you at all.

643
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,790
Begging Yun Jin, kneeling in front of her,

644
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,840
wouldn't take back what happened.

645
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,600
It'd be hypocritical to do this now.

646
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,940
You're right.

647
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,870
I did all that because I couldn't trust my wife.

648
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,040
Sense of guilt.

649
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,310
It's like a fishbone stuck in your throat.

650
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,610
You just need to swallow it.

651
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,320
Hand me the audio file, and you'll see your family.

652
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,590
No.

653
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,920
I can't give it to you all the more.

654
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,640
For you, promises must be like fishbones you need to swallow.

655
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,720
You'll never be able to see your family again.

656
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,100
I'll no longer feel ashamed in front of Ah Rin as her father.

657
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,350
What are you doing?

658
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,630
What are you doing?

659
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,580
What are you doing?

660
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,600
CEO.

661
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,120
CEO?

662
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,690
 Wonjin District Court

663
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,130
What does Defendant Seo Chang Seok mean to you, Witness?

664
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:06,640
For me, my father was...

665
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,360
more devoted to his family than anyone.

666
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,400
Since when were you witness to Ms. Jeong Mi Hyang's gambling?

667
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,010
Since I was eight.

668
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:22,410
Do you think Ms. Jeong fulfilled her duty as a mother?

669
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,010
No.

670
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:33,200
My mom was willing to do anything to gamble.

671
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,520
She even handed her young daughter to a loan shark to borrow money.

672
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,420
That's all.

673
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,950
Witness, did you know Ms. Jeong's cause of death?

674
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,390
It was multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, as I understand.

675
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,440
Do you mean you didn't know she was poisoned with a pesticide?

676
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,400
I didn't know then. I later found out through an insurance investigator.

677
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,480
You're currently suffering from a mental illness, correct?

678
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,070
- Yes.
 - Objection.

679
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:15,200
The prosecution is pressuring the witness with an irrelevant fact.

680
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,530
Your Honor, the witness was hospitalized recently

681
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,500
at a mental institution due to severe bipolar disorder.

682
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,320
Also, she wasn't treated properly due to receiving prescriptions through her father for decades

683
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,120
and she has been fined because of that.

684
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,310
I think it's necessary to question the credibility of her testimony.

685
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,220
Sustained. Continue.

686
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,490
Witness, are you suffering from a mental illness?

687
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,210
Yes.

688
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,850
I am.

689
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,160
Are you still taking medicine?

690
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,390
I'm taking it every day.

691
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,470
That means you haven't recovered.

692
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,500
I'm still being treated.

693
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,320
You've been hospitalized at a mental institution recently, correct?

694
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:07,190
- Yes. 
 - I heard you were hospitalized due to auditory and visual hallucinations.

695
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,880
Is that correct?

696
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,460
Please answer, Witness.

697
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,170
 Defendant

698
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,100
Yes.

699
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,220
Do you still hallucinate?

700
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,810
Yes.

701
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,300
Witness, where's your hallucination right now?

702
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,590
Are they talking to you?

703
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,120
- No.
 - How am I supposed to believe you?

704
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,880
You can't tell apart reality and fantasy

705
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,440
and you're confused right now. Aren't you?

706
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,950
Witness!

707
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,060
I killed her.

708
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,330
I killed her.

709
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:49,940

710
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,810
 My Happy Ending

711
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:59,600
 You mean we need a witness to flip the script, right?

712
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,420
 I need your help, Detective Oh.

713
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,010
 I'm the one who's betting this time.

714
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,300
 Let's try to save both you and me.

715
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,810
 I've been overthinking too much.

716
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,080
 I just had to remove them if they got in the way.

717
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,640
 I no longer want to see anyone getting hurt.

718
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,440
 I'm giving you a last chance.

719
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,180
 I gave you options.

720
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,540
 Freeze!

721
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,190
 You can get out quickly with an extenuating circumstance if you behave.

722
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:26,220
 I never would've been by your side if I wanted something from you.

723
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,660
 The situation has changed now.

724
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,130
 You have so much more to lose now.

725
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,870
 Look forward to it.

726
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,090
♫  I walked aimlessly and just like that  ♫
