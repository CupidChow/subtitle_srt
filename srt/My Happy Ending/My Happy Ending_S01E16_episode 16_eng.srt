 My Happy Ending

 Characters, locales, organizations, incidents,
and situations in this drama are fictitious.

 Arrivals

10
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,480
Mom must be busy today, too.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,020
But I came instead.

12
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,390
You must be very disappointed.

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,460
One can't be in control of how they feel.

14
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,560
Ah Rin, how was living in the US?

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I heard you were in a musical, too.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,870
You would've been surprised if you saw it, too, Aunt.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,500
Really?

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
I'd love to see it, too, someday.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,690
Should we try calling Mom?

20
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,680
Do you think that'd be necessary?

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,100
She's apparently very busy right now.

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,730
But still.

23
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,020
Let me borrow your phone.

24
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm driving right now.

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,040
There it is.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,910
You're not enjoying talking to me so much, huh?

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,360
It's not thatâ€”

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,960
If so, how about this?

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,110
Why don't we have fun and

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,810
we'll surprise her later.

31
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,190
I'm sorry.
  Last Episode

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,400
 Yes, CEO.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
Kwon Yun Jin took Ah Rin.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,270
We don't know what she'll do. We need to find her quickly.

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,530
 Yes, got it.

36
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll contact Detective Oh, too.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,570
Calm down first and...

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,020
drive safely.

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,700
Kwon Yun Jin kidnapped CEO Seo Jae Won's daughter.

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,880
Ask the airport to cooperate and contact the HQ's situation room and request real-time CCTV.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,710
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Hey, come.

42
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,170
Is that true?

43
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,790
Did you really have two boyfriends in the US?

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,210
I had three in Korea.

45
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,570
If only my English were good.

46
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,200
Geez.

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,860
Wow, I'm so impressed.

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,400
Didn't you get married, Aunt?

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm sure you're popular.

50
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,870
Well, it just happened this way.

51
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,090
I suppose being single is easier.

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,560
My goodness. You realized that already?

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,510
Wow, Heo Ah Rin.

54
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,750
I'm starting school soon, too.

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,460
Yes.

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,810
You're right.

57
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,370
Ah Rin is already old enough to start school.

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,880
Do you like it, Ah Rin?

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,260
Yes.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,760
By the way, why are you giving this to me?

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,730
I'm giving you a gift since you're starting elementary school.

62
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm sure Mom will get it for me.

63
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,860
I wanted to get you one, too.

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,890
That's okay, right?

65
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,370
Thank you.

66
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,120
By the way, is this the place you wanted to come?

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,730
Yes.

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,740
If I had a daughter like you,

69
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,980
I'd like to come to an ice cream shop and chat like this.

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,410
I see.

71
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,120
They say life starts today.

72
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,910
What's the deal? Where did you learn to say that?

73
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,090
You learn naturally by living with Grandpa.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
Really?

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,370
What will I do if I miss you again?

76
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,860
We can just meet again.

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,350
You're right.

78
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,560
We can just meet again.

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,810
Ah Rin, when you were in the US

80
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,490
who did you miss the most?

81
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,740
My dad.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,250
It's a secret.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,330
Mom might feel hurt if she found out.

84
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,230
Is it okay to keep a secret from her?

85
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,210
It's okay because we're even.

86
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,120
She's keeping a secret from me, too.

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,340
A secret?

88
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,020
What is it?

89
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,330
It's about Dad.

90
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,840
She won't tell me anything about him.

91
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,500
I was looking forward to seeing him at the airport.

92
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,660
Aren't you curious...

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,020
why she won't tell you about him?

94
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm sure there's a reason.

95
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,120
Eat.

96
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,120
Kwon Yun Jin left the airport in a white sedan around 5:20.

97
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,450
We confirmed that she went to Gangnam by taking the Olympic  Highway.

98
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,820
We're checking places she might've gone to.

99
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,670
I'm sure we'll find her.

100
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,110
Don't worry so much.

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,920
Thank you.

102
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:54,910

103
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,870
 Incoming Call

104
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,290
 Are you looking for Ah Rin?

105
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,250
Kwon Yun Jin.

106
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,620
I won't forgive you if you lay a finger on her.

107
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,710
I haven't seen you getting so excited in a while.

108
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,400
Ah Rin...

109
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,780
Where's Ah Rin right now?

110
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,050
She's doing well. Don't get too worked up.

111
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,740
What do you want?

112
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,780
What I want?

113
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,230
I don't want anything.

114
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,660
Anyway, it looks like she doesn't know anything about Sun Yeong.

115
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,980
 Shouldn't she know?

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,930
By chanceâ€”

117
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,970
How long do you think you can hide it?

118
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,390
I'm not hiding it.

119
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,270
And you don't have the right to say that.

120
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,410
The right?

121
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,260
Where are you?

122
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,360
Where are you right now?

123
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,110
Don't waste your energy, and go home.

124
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,340
You said you wanted to see her.

125
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,260
Ah Rin. Ah Rin...

126
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,960
Ah Rin! Ah Rin!

127
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,020
- Mom! Mom!
 - Ah Rin! Ah Rin!

128
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,550
What took you so long, Mom?

129
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

131
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,780
I can't breathe.

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,250
I missed you so much, Ah Rin.

133
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,520
I missed you, too.

134
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,230
It must've been tiring coming here.

135
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,530
The pretty aunt got me a present, and we had ice cream, too.

136
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,890
It was fun.

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,800
Nothing else happened?

138
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,630
- No. Why?
 - It's nothing.

139
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,730
It's nothing, Ah Rin.

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,580
Is Ah Rin okay?

141
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,620
Yes, she's okay. She's safe.

142
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,460
 That's such a relief.

143
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,450
I'm on my way to your place right now.

144
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,130
Right now?

145
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,440
No, you must be tired. You can go home and rest.

146
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,310
I'll just see your face briefly.

147
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,080
 Okay, then.

148
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,170
I need to tell you something, too.

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,140
 Okay. See you soon, then.

150
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,580
Okay.

151
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,210
 Did you arrive safely, Ah Rin?

152
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,680
Yes. I miss you, Grandpa.

153
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,490
 Gosh, I'll have to come to visit you.

154
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,690
I can visit you, too.

155
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,240
Let's go fishing again.

156
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,220
 You need to study since you're starting school soon.

157
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,280
Grandpa, why are you doing this to me?

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,300
Life isn't that easy.

159
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,280
Life isn't that easy?

160
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Oh, okay. Got it.

161
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,830
 My gosh.

162
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,020
You learned something again.

163
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,650
It's getting late. Go to bed.

164
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,270
Okay. I'll call you again, Grandpa. Bye.

165
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,080
 Bye.

166
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,920
You talked to Grandpa?

167
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,710
My goodness.

168
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,300
- Did you miss me a lot?
 - Yes.

169
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,550
Is Ah Rin sleeping?

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,980
Is something going on?

171
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,440
No.

172
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,870
It's okay. Tell me.

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,690
I don't think I can go on in my condition.

174
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,440
There's nothing wrong with you.

175
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,290
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,560
Since we're on the topic...

177
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,390
Yun Te Oh,

178
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,530
I'm about to ask you a very selfish favor.

179
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,930
 What will I do if I miss you again?

180
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,400
 We can just meet again.

181
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,690
 You're right.

182
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,880
 We can just meet again.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,140
Over here!

184
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,280
- Are you okay?
 - My gosh! My gosh!

185
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,870
Are you okay? Somebody, help!

186
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,140
- Call 911!
 - 911. 911.

187
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,780
Are you okay?

188
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,930
What do we do?

189
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,080
 - No.
 - You're right.

190
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,550
 You'll run out of time. Don't worry, and draw.

191
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,730
 No one here will judge your drawing.

192
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,660
 Because you were there.

193
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,650
 Sun Yeong was a very good partner for me,

194
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,060
 but you were there before him.

195
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,260
 Thank you, Yun Jin.

196
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,970
 Watch carefully...

197
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,360
 what happens to me...

198
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,420
 Father.

199
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,410
- My gosh.
 - Are you okay?

200
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,820
Are you okay?

201
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,360
My gosh. Somebody, help!

202
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,850
We're in front of the Maju Police Station.

203
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,850
There was a car accident. Please send an ambulance.

204
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,950
 My Happy Ending

205
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,060
 Winter, one year later

206
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,440
 Yes, come on in.

207
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,640
 Jo Su Gyeong Psychiatry Clinic

208
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,900
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

209
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,230
Hello.

210
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,010
Have a seat.

211
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,230
I know I contacted you,

212
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,270
but I didn't think I'd be able to meet you like this.

213
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,980
Since I heard you see visions of me,

214
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,130
I was going to refuse. But I became curious

215
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,730
after hearing about what you went through.

216
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,320
I thought you must've suffered a lot, too. So I wanted to be of help.

217
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,020
Thank you.

218
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,920
So, how's my first impression?

219
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,320
Am I very different than the Jo Su Gyeong you knew?

220
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,960
You're a bit...

221
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,770
kind of.

222
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,170
Yes, I can be kind of chatty.

223
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,870
I agree with you, too.

224
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,320
Have you eaten?

225
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,710
Yes. I had udon.

226
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,880
I had udon, too.

227
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,970
What an amazing coincidence.

228
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,870
To be honest,

229
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,440
I thought you'd ask something different than that.

230
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,420
Like what?

231
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,930
Whether I still see my friend Su Gyeong or something like that.

232
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,120
Whether you hallucinate or not is certainly important.

233
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,470
But how much you focus on it is more important.

234
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,170
You're looking into my eyes right now.

235
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,680
You've been focusing on me since you first came in.

236
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,330
If so...

237
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,300
where should we start?

238
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,950
â™«  If you follow the footsteps  â™«

239
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,270
â™«  of someone whose heart left first  â™«

240
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,970
 Seo Jae Won's amazing business skills that allowed DerÃªve to return to normal.

241
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,190
Try some caviar while waiting.

242
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,960
Thank you.

243
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,300
Here's a premium product prepared just for you.

244
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,470
 Kahi Cavi Balm

245
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,540
Let's try this on.

246
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,310
â™«  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  â™«

247
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:38,900
â™«  Without thinking about anything  â™«

248
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,200
It's nice.

249
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,900
â™«  I am sure we'll dance  â™«

250
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,380
Thank you in advance.

251
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,700
 DerÃªve &amp; SY Venture Capital's contract signing

252
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,250
You went through a lot, Mr. Park.

253
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,470
The same goes for you, Ms. Seo.

254
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm not just talking about the recent incident.

255
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,920
There have been big and small incidents,

256
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,150
but the reason DerÃªve could stayed strong without being shaken

257
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,920
is because you were there, Mr. Park.

258
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,550
Thank you.

259
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,980
I released the press material about attracting investors.

260
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,930
There are many articles about it already. It's being received pretty well.

261
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,510
Really?

262
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,990
What a relief.

263
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,930
- Thank you. 
 - Congratulations.

264
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,100
We knew things would turn out well!

265
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,490
We knew it.

266
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,720
CEO, let's go ahead and have a staff meal.

267
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,700
Seo Jae Won! Seo Jae Won!

268
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,360
Seo Jae Won! Seo Jae Won!

269
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,140
Thank you so much, everyone.

270
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,810
For today...

271
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,760
Wow, daebak (awesome).

272
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,070
it's on me.

273
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,320
Daebak.

274
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,220
Thank you, CEO.

275
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,900
We'll be waiting for you, then.

276
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,220
- Thank you. We'll enjoy it.
 - Thank you.

277
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,710
Beef! Beef!

278
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,870
You should join us, too.

279
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,170
Go ahead.

280
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,700
I have things left to do.

281
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,200
 Dear employees, this is Seo Jae Won.

282
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,530
 I'm writing an email since I had to

283
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,290
  muster the courage to tell you something.

284
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,450
 I'm sure you experienced confusion

285
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,390
 and difficulties because of the many incidents involving me.

286
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,250
 For everything that has happened,

287
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,480
 I want to sincerely apologize to you.

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,100
 I've been suffering inside for a long time,

289
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,280
 but I never thought about accepting

290
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,350
 the illness and fighting it head-on.

291
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,520
 I didn't have the courage. I was afraid

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,050
 to fight against the prejudice the world holds.

293
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,330
 I hurt people

294
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,130
 around me in the process as well.

295
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,510
 I made wrong decisions I shouldn't have made as a company's CEO, too.

296
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,510
 I'll step down from the CEO position

297
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,700
 and take some time to reflect on my actions.

298
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,930
 The time I shared with you

299
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,090
 will remain a happy memory for a long time.

300
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,280
 Sincerely, Seo Jae Won.

301
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,910
You thought I wouldn't know you missed the payment deadline while worrying about other vendors?

302
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,010
I'll give you a week.

303
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,780
Okay. I'll assume you will and hang up.

304
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,000
- Good morning.
 - Hello, CEO Yun.

305
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
 CEO Yoon Te Oh

306
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,960
What's my schedule today?

307
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,220
A meeting with the design team is scheduled.

308
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,740
In the afternoon, a client meeting, an ad campaign concept meeting,

309
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,000
and the sales team's finance briefing are scheduled.

310
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,290
Another busy day.

311
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,740
They look very nice.

312
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,430
But the height of this should be a bit lower.

313
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,950
To get a better B2B outcome...

314
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,870
You'll see by looking at our office's interior design.

315
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,030
We designed a space that allows

316
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,200
creative thoughts and free communication.

317
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,890
 You must've felt this way, too.

318
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,160
Ah Rin, lean the seat back and sleep if you're tired.

319
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,980
No, I'm not tired.

320
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,840
I'll chat with you so you don't get sleepy.

321
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,320
I'll have mackerel at Grandpa's place.

322
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,980
Either that or the seaweed soup.

323
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,180
Grandpa!

324
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,830
Aigoo, my Ah Rin is here.

325
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,740
- Aren't you tired?
 - Not at all.

326
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,210
Aigoo, you little.

327
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,720
- Let's go in.
 - Let's.

328
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,650
Okay. Here we go.

329
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,040
- It's cold.
 - Let's go.

330
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,090
Aigoo, aigoo.

331
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,820
It's nice to come here with you, Dad.

332
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,500
I know.

333
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,730
Looks like a lot of people your age exercise.

334
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,210
You're taking good care of your health, right?

335
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,750
I try to, but you can't fool your age.

336
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,960
Climbing up and down the stairs is hard these days.

337
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,160
Dad.

338
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,680
Take these.

339
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,130
You need to care for your body to enjoy hiking often.

340
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,340
Thank you.

341
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,930
Aigoo. Is it okay to visit me this often?

342
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,450
Aren't you busy?

343
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,300
I just...

344
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,510
had something to tell you.

345
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,640
What is it?

346
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,930
Let's live together, Dad.

347
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,580
Aigoo. I can't do that at my age.

348
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,930
I don't want to burden you.

349
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,400
I know how you feel.

350
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,220
That's why I haven't brought it up.

351
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,900
But...

352
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,000
we went through a lot recently.

353
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,670
- But still, Jae Wonâ€”
 - Dad.

354
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,100
Please?

355
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,680
Okay, okay.

356
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:08,560
Ah Rin doesn't know about Sun Yeong yet, right?

357
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,190
No.

358
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,300
I couldn't tell her yet.

359
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,820
 To be honest, I was afraid.

360
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,610
This is when you were a baby.

361
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,930
It's Dad.

362
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,920
Yes, it's Dad.

363
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,210
 I wonder whether doing that would...

364
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,200
 destroy everything when things finally are settling down.

365
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,940
â™«  Does it matter after all?  â™«

366
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,140
 How did you feel after feeling afraid?

367
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,580
â™«  In the time I put off  â™«

368
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,180
â™«  I wonder  â™«

369
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,820
 I thought I should face it head-on now.

370
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,750
 I thought I shouldn't avoid it anymore.

371
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,980
â™«  Can you make all of the scars just disappear?  â™«

372
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,960
â™«  But when I close my eyes  â™«

373
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,070

Are you still not satisfied?

374
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,850
How much longer will you do this?

375
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,540
Do you know what comes to my mind whenever I get a call from the police?

376
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,130
Mom.

377
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,780
Mom!

378
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,570
I'm begging you to stop, okay?

379
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,390
This time, it's really unfair.

380
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,300
I really...

381
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,850
I didn't go there to gamble.

382
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,900
A friend told me to come over, so I thought I'd check out her placeâ€”

383
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,800
Do you call that an excuse right now?

384
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
Hold on, Jae Won.

385
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,210
What?

386
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,390
It's nothing. Later.

387
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,670
I'll tell you later.

388
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,310
â™«  In the night when everything goes dark   â™«

389
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,760

â™«  (everything goes dark)  â™«

390
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:32,160
â™«  I try and try to find my peace of mind (fall inside)  â™«

391
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,010
â™«  In my broken heart  â™«

392
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,920
â™«  I'm walking  â™«

393
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,420
â™«  Can you make all of the scars just disappear?  â™«

394
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:53,600
â™«  But when I close my eyes  â™«

395
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:02,080
â™«  Both your smile in the moment which brushed by  â™«

396
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,830
â™«  Stuck inside my heart with broken parts (Now I know)  â™«

397
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:17,400
â™«  And the bland greeting in the whispered words  â™«

398
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:27,350
â™«  Fall to pieces whenever you come around  â™«

399
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,760
â™«  Oh why  â™«

400
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
Gosh, Ah Rin. I left something at the grocery store.

401
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,100
What?

402
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,370
Oh, my God.

403
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,580
I'm sorry. Let's go real quick.

404
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,570
Here.

405
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,750
Jae Won,

406
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,560
why don't you take a break for a bit?

407
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,990
What are you talking about? I'm here to take a break.

408
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,030
I meant all by yourself.

409
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,570
Where would I go without Ah Rin?

410
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,060
Ah Rin, what do you think about this?

411
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,420
I want Mom to go.

412
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,850
I think you should take a break, too.

413
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,830
Thank you for worrying about me,

414
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,250
but I swear I'm okay.

415
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,080
I appreciate it, but no, thank you.

416
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,020
You'll get a lot busier when I start school next year.

417
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,940
I'm giving you a vacation in advance. Be sure to take it.

418
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,100
Aigoo.

419
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,310
Yes, Jae Won. You should go.

420
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:52,760
Ah Rin, where would you like her to take a trip to?

421
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,700
A theme park?

422
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,750
A theme park?

423
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,550
- Let's eat.
 - Let's eat.

424
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,180
 I think that was the first time...

425
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,900
 where nothing happened each and every day.

426
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,070
 A day where I didn't have to work so hard.

427
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:06,150
A day that let me focus on nothing but myself.

428
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,200
It must've allowed you to relax.

429
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,140
How about the symptoms?

430
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,400
Were you still hallucinating then?

431
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,990
 Wherever I went,

432
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,690
 she was always with me.

433
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,590
 And...

434
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,300
Who are you?

435
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,870
I must've scared you.

436
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,350
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,330
I'm the owner of the house.

438
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,570
I wanted to check if everything was okay.

439
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,080
Do you find anything uncomfortable?

440
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,890
Gosh, there isn't much in here.

441
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,700
Have you eaten?

442
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,240
 I knew it wasn't real from the beginning.

443
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,420
 Unlike my friend, Su Gyeong,

444
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,550
 her presence didn't make any sense

445
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,160
 because it was my mom.

446
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,340
I found chamomile flowers on my walk.

447
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,840
Aren't they pretty?

448
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,390
I'll put them in the bedroom. Have a look.

449
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,030
Apparently, these help you sleep.

450
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,610
CEO Seo was cute when she was little, too.

451
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm not saying because she's my daughter.

452
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,300
Whenever I went out with her, everyone said

453
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,060
she was so pretty and precious.

454
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,290
- Oppa.
 - Yes.

455
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,610
- Ah Rin is sleeping in the other room. 
 - Okay.

456
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,930
By the way, who's he?

457
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,250
I'll tell you later. You should leave.

458
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,930
Hold on. You look familiar.

459
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,200
Oh, it's him. We met when we ate together last time, right?

460
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,500
Yes.

461
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,910
You look so handsome with the new hairstyle.

462
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,550
- Leave right now. 
 - Okay.

463
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,280
By the way, what brings you here?

464
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,750
Well, I wanted to see Father.

465
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,860
- "Father"?
 - Hey, I told you to leave!

466
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,220
Gosh. Okay, fine.

467
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,550
By the way, how old are you?

468
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,450
Leave, leave! Geez, leave right now.

469
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,490
Take care.

470
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,030
Have a seat here.

471
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,550
You came because of Jae Won, right?

472
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes.

473
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm not bothering her because I think she needs time on her own.

474
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,390
I know how strong she is.

475
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,260
So I know she must be hanging in there

476
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,910
and I should trust her and wait for her.

477
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,540
But I can't help but be worried.

478
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,100
I wonder if she's eating well

479
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,610
and what if she's feeling hurt or crying alone.

480
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,090
I just...

481
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,750
I just miss her.

482
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,770
Why...

483
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,540
are you trying to take a difficult path?

484
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,890
I like her very much.

485
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,050
That's the reason.

486
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,110
Nothing else.

487
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:59,920

488
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,500
 The fact that you met your mom at the cabin

489
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,420
 might mean it was meant to be.

490
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,360
Because your hurt feelings had to be resolved.

491
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,130
That's why I thought I shouldn't keep ignoring her.

492
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,550
You came.

493
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,570
Please prepare a meal for me.

494
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,510
Wait just a moment.

495
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,780
I haven't had lunch yet, either.

496
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,730
You don't mind me joining you, right?

497
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,510
Go ahead.

498
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,970
Eating alone makes you feel lonely.

499
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,230
Help yourself.

500
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,700
I noticed how skinny you are. You need to gain weight.

501
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,840
You need to eat well to gain weight.

502
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Try some.

503
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,470
It's tasty.

504
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,450
This is lavender tea.

505
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,480
It smells so nice.

506
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,430
There's something I want to tell you.

507
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,870
You'll listen, right?

508
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,760
Yes, go ahead.

509
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,420
It happened when I was eight.

510
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,550
My mom tried to kill me then.

511
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,470
 Mom.

512
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,460
 I'm cold.

513
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,110
 I'm scared.

514
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,030
 I want to go home.

515
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,490
Mom.

516
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,840
Why did you do that to me then?

517
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,820
Why did you do that to me?

518
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,700
I had no choice.

519
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,350
Life was so hard.

520
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,160
I couldn't endure it anymore.

521
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,180
You were so little. Leaving you behind

522
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,970
didn't feel right.

523
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,340
Stop making excuses.

524
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,170
Not everyone makes that choice just because life is hard.

525
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,090
You...

526
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,550
You just thought of me...

527
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,680
as your belonging.

528
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,420
You thought I was someone you could just

529
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,690
kill whenever.

530
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,400
Am I wrong?

531
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,940
I...

532
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,580
I didn't want to die.

533
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,550
I wanted to...

534
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,350
I wanted to live with you, Mom.

535
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,790
Because I really loved you.

536
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,280
Living happily with you

537
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,040
was everything I wanted.

538
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,040
So, apologize to me.

539
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,180
Apologize to me sincerely.

540
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm sorry.

541
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,770
I'm so sorry.

542
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,550
Jae Won,

543
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,840
I did the wrong thing.

544
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,030
No matter how hard it was,

545
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,000
I shouldn't have done that.

546
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,610
It's all my fault.

547
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,060
Why was it so hard to say that?

548
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,170
Your whole life...

549
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,800
Why...

550
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,070
Why?

551
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,030
I wasn't trying to play ignorant forever.

552
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,670
I was going to tell you that day.

553
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:06,930
 I wanted to tell you before you gave birth to Ah Rin.

554
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,210
Jae Won,

555
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,430
please remember this one thing.

556
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,850
It's not because...

557
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,530
I didn't...

558
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,480
love you.

559
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,350
I just...

560
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,090
didn't realize that because I was immature then.

561
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,640
Jae Won,

562
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,790
I'm so sorry.

563
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,370
I'm sorry.

564
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,230
I'm sorry.

565
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,660
Now...

566
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,250
forget all the bad memories.

567
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,850
Only remember the happy and good memories.

568
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,420
You must...

569
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,010
do that for yourself.

570
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,460
I will.

571
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,390
 I know she wasn't real.

572
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,730
She was just an illusion I created.

573
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,130
But I had to do thatâ€”

574
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,250
I'm glad you did.

575
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,840
You took a step forward, Ms. Seo.

576
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,420
Is that so?

577
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,420
Mom, there's a dead bird here!

578
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,500
Ah Rin.

579
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,530
You're right.

580
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,510
I wonder what happened.

581
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,970
I feel bad for him.

582
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,200
Should we bury him?

583
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,640
- Yes.
 - Okay.

584
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,000
Goodbye, birdie.

585
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,450
Rest easy in heaven.

586
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,770
Goodbye.

587
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,330
Well done.

588
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,700
Mom, where are we?

589
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,400
This is...

590
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,140
where Dad is.

591
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,070
Dad? Is he here?

592
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,340
- Yes.
 - Where?

593
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,060
Where is he?

594
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,230
Dad!

595
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,790
Ah Rin...

596
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,050
He is here, but...

597
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,800
you won't be able to meet him.

598
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,440
Why?

599
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:01,270
Just like the little bird,

600
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,000
he went to heaven.

601
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,980
Just like the stone grave we made for the little birdie,

602
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,550
this place protects Dad and keeps him warm.

603
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,140
Is he dead?

604
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,300
- Yes.
 - That's why you couldn't tell me, right?

605
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,580
Yes.

606
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,990
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you...

607
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,900
Dad went to heaven early, Ah Rin.

608
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,960
Dad.

609
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,970
I miss him a lot, too.

610
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,960
Dad!

611
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,700
 Heo Sun Yeong

612
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,430
Dad, I missed you.

613
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:28,460
My English improved a lot while I was in the US.

614
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:34,940
I'll get a perfect score every day and visit you to brag about it.

615
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:41,570
So, don't forget to watch me.

616
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,910
Okay?

617
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,710
Dad, I love you.

618
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,150
How's the new collaboration project you mentioned going?

619
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,560
I sent the proposal to the designer.

620
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,860
The design team will have a meeting with her next week.

621
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,950
Shouldn't she have a meeting with me first?

622
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,260
This is our first collaboration with a freelance designer.

623
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,750
I'll decide whether we'll go forward with the project after I meet her.

624
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,320
Contact her and say I want to have a meeting today.

625
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,690
I'll ask if she is available.

626
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,360
How could a designer make the CEO wait?

627
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,750
Does this make any sense?

628
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,850
It sort of does.

629
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,230
Should I call her?

630
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,310
Let's wait five more minutes.

631
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,280
Sorry, I'm late.

632
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,190
You're three minutes late, Ms. Seo.

633
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:23,490
I'm sorry. I was contacted out of the blue.

634
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,180
Have a seat.

635
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,630
You brought the portfolio, right?

636
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,480
Yes, here it is.

637
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,980
Yes, you're as good as I heard.

638
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,810
Thank you.

639
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,070
You'll be working as the team leader

640
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,400
of the new line for this project.

641
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,440
And you'll be working with us here at DerÃªve, too.

642
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,110
Will you be okay with that?

643
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,600
Just come back.

644
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,510
I'm in your care now, Team Leader Seo Jae Won.

645
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,290
I hope we get along, CEO Yun Te Oh.

646
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,920
How does it feel

647
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,300
to become independent as a freelance designer?

648
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,430
It feels great.

649
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,260
I see.

650
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,900
You forced me to become the CEO.

651
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,310
And I've been working overtime every day,

652
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,320
but you're happy.

653
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,070
It's nighttime, but the weather is nice.

654
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,350
You know what?

655
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,300
You seem very relaxed these days.

656
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,430
Yes, I'm relaxed.

657
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,600
Sketching and making furniture all day

658
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,310
seems to make my worries disappear.

659
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,880
I started this because I enjoyed designing so much.

660
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,270
I wonder why I'd been forgetting this feeling.

661
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,010
That's a relief.

662
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,320
Do whatever you want to do and

663
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,110
enjoy the moment as much as possible.

664
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,120
Thank you, Te Oh.

665
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,080
It must've been a difficult decision,

666
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,000
but you took over DerÃªve for me.

667
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,240
Thank you so much.

668
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,200
Here we go again.

669
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,400
You keep thanking me because you're worried I might quit.

670
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,240
You got me.

671
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,290
If you're so thankful,

672
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,820
do you want to come to the meeting with the finance team later?

673
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,400
Look, I finished it.

674
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,700
You should manage it yourself, CEO.

675
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,420
How can you do this to me?

676
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,690
Gosh.

677
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,330
How about the sales team or the HR meeting?

678
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,530
Why don't you pick something nicer since you're going to Santiago?

679
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,750
What are you doing here?

680
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm watching you so you don't do anything stupid again.

681
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,580
These look good.

682
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,520
Should I get these?

683
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,340
- Are you coming, too?
 - Give me a freaking break.

684
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,650
This is to celebrate you leaving jail.

685
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,510
What size do you wear?

686
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,800
What are you doing here? Are you coming, too?

687
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,990
I brought a scoop that you'd be very interested in, Detective Nam.

688
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:28,850
Would you like to hear it?

689
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,090
I don't want it.

690
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,610
This is a huge deal, Detective Nam!

691
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,910
Those bastards.

 Thanks to all other languages moderators, editors &amp; subtitlers.

698
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,540
I'm back from school!

699
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,410
Hi. Did you have a good day, Ah Rin?

700
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,680
Yes.

701
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,710
Wash your hands and get ready to go to the academy.

702
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,380
I just got home. Why go to the academy already?

703
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,820
I'm not going.

704
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,980
Did you finish your homework?

705
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,000
How much wealth and prosperity could I possibly get?

706
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,050
Heo Ah Rin, I'll cut your allowance by half if you don't get up immediately.

707
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,140
You can't do that.

708
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,880
Dad, what did you teach her?

709
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,860
I didn't teach her anything. She just picked it up.

710
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:13,310
â™«  If I look at the sky moving further away  â™«

711
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:19,100
â™«  I will leave without any regrets  â™«

712
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:24,960
â™«  Our appearing like we had been together a long time  â™«

713
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,800
â™«  will not seem any different  â™«

714
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,910
â™«  Dreams will disappear  â™«

715
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:41,590
â™«  The dreams without you will all disappear  â™«

716
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,590
Heo Ah Rin!

717
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,970
Ah Rinâ€”

718
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,460
You took too long. Don't you think?

719
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,430
- You didn't forget anything, right?
 - Of course not.

720
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,160
Let's go.

721
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:05,760
â™«  Even if the paths we have taken are a little different  â™«

722
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:17,580
â™«  I know they are not wrong  â™«

723
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,500
Did you stay up all night?

724
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,310
You came.

725
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,040
Is there a lot to do? Why don't you take it easy?

726
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,060
Instead of saying that to me,

727
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,390
you could say I look cool, I'm doing great, or stuff like that.

728
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,850
I need to hear something like that.

729
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,560
You're doing so great, CEO Yun Te Oh.

730
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,180
Just with words?

731
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,650
You can do stuff like this. You know.

732
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,560
Get some rest.

733
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,460
This is me resting.

734
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm recharging right now.

735
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,740
As I mentioned last time, get a wide range of color samples for the bookshelf.

736
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,750
Yes, got it, CEO Seo.

737
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,860
I mean, Team Leader Seo.

738
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,130
I'm still saying that by habit.

739
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,130
I get confused sometimes, too.

740
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,800
I sometimes go to the CEO's office when I get here.

741
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,370
I think CEO Yun would like that.

742
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,980
Have some coffee first.

743
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,440
What's going on here?

744
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,710
Did you talk behind my back?

745
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,650
Thank you so much, Mr. Yun.

746
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,760
Wow, thank you.

747
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,310
Here you go.

748
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,340
That's it for today, right?

749
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,880
Yes, CEO.

750
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,360
I'll rest after confirming the design today, just so you know.

751
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,250
May I work outside the office, then?

752
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,720
Team Leader Seo asked me to join her for market research.

753
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,450
- Market research?
 - Yes.

754
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:14,180
She wants to browse the new foreign brand shops in Sinsa-dong (a popular Gangnam neighborhood).

755
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,840
Go ahead.

756
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:20,040
CEO,

757
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:26,870
I'm suddenly thinking it might be better for an expert to join her instead.

758
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:35,960
Yes, I guess an expert should go since it's so important.

759
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,910
Thank you, Seong Hui.

760
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,110
CEO.

761
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,380
We've walked a lot. Aren't you tired?

762
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,990
No, I'm okay. I got to see new furniture, too.

763
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,590
Building a house somewhere like this,

764
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:17,450
raising children, making furniture,

765
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,420
and living with someone you love.

766
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,520
What do you think of that?

767
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,750
Why do you look at me like that?

768
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,220
Te Oh,

769
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,700
thank you.

770
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,030
Why all of a sudden?

771
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,850
At some point,

772
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:46,590
I started taking having you with me for granted.

773
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,250
I think I've forgotten how precious that is.

774
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,740
I'm sorry I realized that too late.

775
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:07,060
Why does your thanks sound like a goodbye to me?

776
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,010
Because we can't keep going like this.

777
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,090
Why can't we?

778
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,050
I'll surely continue to be by your side going forward.

779
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,670
Because I have an illness.

780
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,110
What's wrong with that?

781
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,620
It's an important matter.

782
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,000
Yes, it's important.

783
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,020
But that's not everything that defines you.

784
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:32,560
You have a lot more valuable things than that illness.

785
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,880
You're pretty,

786
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,260
cute,

787
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,400
and you're adorable, too.

788
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,040
The fact that you're ill is just a tiny...

789
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,300
nothing but a tiny little part of you.

790
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,160
That's not entirely Seo Jae Won.

791
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,900
So, don't try to reject me using that.

792
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,370
I won't rush things.

793
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,120
So...

794
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,430
just don't push me away.

795
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,970
It might take a long time.

796
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,960
Would that be okay?

797
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,880
Do you mean...

798
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,820
Of course! Of course, I can wait.

799
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,130
You scared me.

800
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,140
How long do I have to wait?

801
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,500
It's not that I'm impatient.

802
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,570
It'd be nice to know a rough date. Until when?

803
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,840
I need to go. Ah Rin will be back soon.

804
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,140
So, until when should I wait?

805
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,500
Not until Ah Rin gets married or anything like that, right?

806
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,260
I need to hurry. I need to go.

807
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,330
Please tell me, CEO. Please!

808
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:03,300
You achieved a lot more things than I expected.

809
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,510
I'll accept myself for who I am now.

810
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:16,470
And the three people whom I thought turned their backs on me,

811
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:20,090
I'll remember the fact

812
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:25,820
that they were the most precious people who stood by me.

813
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:36,020
You need to continue your treatment going forward.

814
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,850
Yes, Doctor.

815
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,950
Thank you.

816
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:50,070
I've been wanting to tell you that in person at least once.

817
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:11,380

818
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:19,000
â™«  What would it have been like if we hadn't become like this?  â™«

819
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,980
â™«  Even if I try to take it out,   â™«

820
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,760
â™«  it's scattered through the empty darkness  â™«

821
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,930
â™«  I wanna know.  â™«

822
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,650
â™«  You blow in.  â™«

823
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:42,060
â™«  I wanna know  â™«

824
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,930
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  â™«

825
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,820
â™«  In the wave of memory surging over the end  â™«

826
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,160
â™«  I'm not okay  â™«

827
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,440
Here's the last one!

828
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,440
One, two, three!

829
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,740
 I think I finally understand...

830
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,030
 that there's no happy ending in life.

831
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:12,880
 You might be happy today, but you'll face hardship tomorrow.

832
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,810
 But you'll become happy again the day after.

833
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:22,630
 I just need to manage repetitive everyday life

834
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,630
 with the precious people who are by my side.

835
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,390
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  â™«

836
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:36,370
â™«  In the wave of memory surging over the end  â™«

837
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:40,160
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't hear your voice  â™«

838
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,470
â™«  I picture us who are only in my dream  â™«

839
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:53,430

840
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,330
â™«  I'm left alone in the dark  â™«

841
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:01,240
â™«  I'm wandering searching the dream for the light which is you  â™«

842
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,060
â™«  I'm left alone in the dark  â™«

843
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,470
â™«  I'm searching for the light which is you  â™«

844
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:11,180
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  â™«

845
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,020
â™«  In the wave of memory surging over the end  â™«

846
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,970
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't hear your voice  â™«

847
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:24,910
â™«  I picture us who are only in my dream  â™«

848
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,250
â™«  I will cling to it  â™«

849
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,520
â™«  On the truth, which is harsh, the aborted ending  â™«

850
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:39,470
â™«  Will you also look back at us from then sometimes?  â™«

851
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:45,520
â™«  I wanna know.  â™«

852
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,220
â™«  You blow in.  â™«

853
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:53,780
â™«  I wanna know  â™«

854
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:57,630
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  â™«

855
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:01,470
â™«  In the wave of memory surging over the end  â™«

856
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,380
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't hear your voice  â™«

857
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:11,620
â™«  I picture us who are only in my dream  â™«

858
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,560
â™«  I'm left alone in the dark  â™«

859
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,380
â™«  I'm searching for the light which is you  â™«

860
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,250
â™«  I'm left alone in the dark  â™«

861
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,690

862
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:36,090
â™«  I'm not okay, I can't feel your touch  â™«

863
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,070
 My Happy Ending
