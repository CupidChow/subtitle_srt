 - Yes?

Have you seen my light blue blouse? I need to wear it for the interview today.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,310
Oh, that? I washed it and put it on the terrace.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,220
No, no, not there. Upstairs. Upstairs.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,720
- Upstairs?
 - Yes.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,000
Ah Rin, the food is almost ready. Wait a moment.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,960
Let's eat this quickly for now.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,480
Aigoo, why am I so busy on my own?

17

Ah Rin, here—

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,010
What's all this, Ah Rin?

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,110
Have you been cooking, too?

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,890
No, no, no. You should eat now.

21

Three, two, one. Ding! Dad wins.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,130
You can't use such a hard word with a six-year-old baby.

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,360
What? Are you a baby, Ah Rin?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
You told me you're a child now.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm still a baby.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,310
So, please give me a pass just once.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,050
Baby. Okay, okay.

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,410
- Ah Rin's Dad!
 - Hello.

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,190
- Ah Rin's going to kindergarten.
 - Say hello, Ah Rin.

39
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,190
Hello, ma'am.

40
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,900
You look so pretty today, Ah Rin.

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,810
The theme is princess today.

42
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,900
You look exactly like a princess now that you mention it.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,320
Your eyes are big, and your nose is pointy, too.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Where did you get your pronounced double eyelids from?

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,590
I don't think it's either Dad or Mom.

46
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,950
Did you get it from Grandpa?

47
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,390
We just got lucky.

48
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,670
Looks like you're coming back from a walk.

49
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,240
Yes, Seung Gyu. It's been a while.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,590
 Professor, have you been well?

51
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,670
Of course.

52
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,160
 I stopped by the school because Chan Ho said he'd treat us to a meal since he got a job.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,240
But I was disappointed you weren't there.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,050
It would've been nice to see you.

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,730
 When are you coming back to school?

56
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,320
I wonder. I need to go back soon.

How's work? Any challenges?

61
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,330
 Well, I'm doing okay at work. Nothing's too difficult.

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,070
 Ah Rin isn't your daughter

63
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,300
 Right. Did you hear the news?

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,110
What?

65
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,170
Wh-What did you say? I'm sorry, I missed that.

66
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,590
 The beautiful CEO is also witty.

67
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,340
 Your husband must be so proud of you, too.

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,810
 May I ask you what he does for a living?

69
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,360
 My husband? Do you really not know?

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,350
 The students line up to see his face whenever new semesters start.

71
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,350
 He's a college professor. If you look him up...

72
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,500
- What? When did you get here?
  - you'll see how handsome he is.

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,670
Don't watch this.

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,890
Why not? You looked pretty.

75
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,030
I prepared a lot for the interview, but she asked what you do

76
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,570
and how high the sales are.

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,230
She only asked what I didn't agree to discuss.

78
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,400
It must've been difficult.

79
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,880
- J-Jae Won.
 - Yeah?

80
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,640
Did anything happen today?

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,870
Today? Like what?

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,860
Earlier today, some psycho—

83
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,370
Huh?

84
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,550
Never mind.

85
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm tired. I'll take a shower and go to bed.

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,900
- Get some rest.
 - Okay.

87
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,930
Well...

88
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,720

89
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,800

91
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,790
- Huh?
 - Three, two, one. Ding!

92
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,000
Yay! I won!

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,460
I didn't hear you.

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,060
Should I give you one more chance?

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,450
Yes.

96
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,200
Say, "Give me one more chance."

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,640
Give me one more chance.

98
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,800
This is a burner email address.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,900
There are burner emails, too?

100
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,850
Yes. You don't have to sign up, and the account disappears after time passes.

101
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,560
It won't be easy to track down the sender.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,150
Really?

103
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,600
Okay. Thank you.

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,740
Team Leader Yun!  Team Leader Yun!

168
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,870
CEO, have some tea...

169
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,120
CEO!

170
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,780
CEO.

171
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,890
Where are you going? You're heading to the electrical room.

172
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,410
Where...

173
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,690
Where did you want to go?

174
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,400
Where am I?

175
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,910
Pardon?

176
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,980
Wait...

177
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,710
 I really had no idea.

178
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,840
 This situation I had never even imagined.

179
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,300
 I never would've thought all of this had started because of me.

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,960
 Team Leader Yun Te Oh

181
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,210
 You endured me? You?

182
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,840
 Do you really think you have the right to tell me that?

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,480
 Do you?

184
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
 Subjects A and C are not a match.

185
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,530
 Subjects A and C are not related since the STR (short tandem repeats) in their DNA don't match.

186
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,920
 If you knew,

187
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,470
 do you think you'd become free?

188
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,660
 I want you to experience the worst pain in the world.

189
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,370
 I really want you to learn...

190
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,660
 what it's like

191
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,210
 to live in hell.

192
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,340
 My Husband

193
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,040
What are you doing here?

194
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,510
Since when have you been like this?

195
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,340
 Headache

196
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,380
It would be better to get angry and scream,

197
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,340
or cry if you want.

198
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,930
Don't be like that and do something, Jae Won.

199
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,800
Am I supposed to?

200
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,420
It's because I don't know

201
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,970
what I'm supposed to do.

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,110
Just what terrible things have I done in the past?

203
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,390
 CEO Seo Jae Won

204
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,180
Shit.

205
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,800
Who the hell are you?

206
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,680
Geez. This is expensive.

207
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,580
You got caught doing something wrong. Why are you so defiant?

208
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm just here to cover a story.

209
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,280
Is that so? I can just check myself.

210
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,090
Geez. Hey. What are you doing?

211
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,790
Is taking photos illegally considered covering a story?

212
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,870
It's not that...

213
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,720
Just what are you defiant about?

214
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I won't just let you do this to me, either.

215
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,670
What? Did you see something you weren't supposed to?

216
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,620
Have you been following Nam Tae Ju, too?

217
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,740
Sounds like you know him well, too.

218
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,630
I'm working on a huge story right now.

219
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,040
Well...

220
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,670
Probably the consequences when this comes out won't be a joke.

221
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,030
Aren't you curious what I'm talking about?

222
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,110
I'll take this with me.

223
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,020
When did you find out?

224
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,240
That CEO Seo Jae Won isn't sane.

225
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,550
What are you talking about?

226
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,690
Did I hit the nail on the head?

227
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,640
I know it's a mental condition, but I don't know what it's called.

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,000
Give me a hint.

229
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,260
Or should I ask her husband, who's in a custody battle with her?

230
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,370
A mother can't raise her daughter if she's mentally ill, right?

231
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,980
Keep running your mouth.

232
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,680
Sue me, if you want,

233
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,740
for assault or whatever suits you.

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,820
According to the stock transaction history,

235
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,620
you own a lot of Derêve's shares.

236
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,840
You probably already know, but Seo Jae Won and I go way back.

237
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm concerned.

238
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,180
She's been causing noise because of the divorce and whatnot.

239
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,470
We don't have to prepare anything in particular for the confirmation hearing, right?

240
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,110
Excuse me.

241
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,730
Welcome, Minister Kwon Yeong Ik.

242
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:59,530
I heard Yun Te Oh has been poking around the Baek Seung Gyu case.

243
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,560
He won't say anything unnecessary, right?

244
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,820
There's no way.

245
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,990
I covered up that case with my own hands.

246
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,980
 Yein Arts Scholarship Foundation

247
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,540
- Yun Te Oh—
 - Regarding Yun Te Oh...

248
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,050
Let's just keep an eye on him.

249
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,650
All the evidence is gone. What can he do?

250
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,610
Yes, come in.

251
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,420
I suppose I can leave now.

252
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,980
See you again, Minister.

253
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,400
Put it in his trunk.

254
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,800
I think it was at the first launch show.

255
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,640
CEO, we have five minutes left.

256
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,940
The mood is great right now.

257
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,250
I hope it continues to be great after five minutes.

258
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,240
 Let's welcome CEO Seo Jae Won of Derêve.

259
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,600
 Derêve

260
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,310
Hello, I'm Seo Jae Won.

261
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:42,400
I sincerely thank all of you for attending Derêve's first launch show.

262
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,310
CEO Seo.

263
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,910
Say hello. This is Minister Song of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

264
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,390
Thank you for coming.

265
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,660
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

266
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,350
Chairman told me a lot about you.

267
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,850
She's been focusing on developing smart furniture.

268
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,420
She'll need a lot of your help from now on, Minister.

269
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,740
Of course, I'll help.

270
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,900
Should we toast?

271
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,250
Sounds great.

272
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,720
- Here.
 - Well, I...

273
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,380
I can't drink...

274
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,010
Why not? You don't have other plans today.

275
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,060
Well, the thing is...

276
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,940
It's not that hard to have just one glass.

277
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,950
Hurry up.

278
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,240
What are you doing? Take it.

279
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,150
Okay, cheers, then.

280
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,140
See? You drink just fine.

281
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,230
Here. Should we have another round?

282
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,930
Sounds good.

283
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,580
For the future of the Minister and Derêve.

284
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,250
- Here.
- Cheers.

285
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,060
- You're a good drinker.
- Another round.

286
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,610
Here.

287
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,770
CEO Seo.

288
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,600
Are you okay?

289
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,770
I think you drank too much.

290
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

291
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,910
 My Husband

292
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,720
 You got really drunk.

293
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,050
 Where are you right now?

294
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,740
 Secretary Kim

295
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,160
Who is this...

296
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,970
Yes.

297
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,450
 Are you up, CEO?

298
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,990
Yes.

299
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,010
 I'll pick you up at your room in 30 minutes.

300
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,670
By the way,

301
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,800
who brought me here

302
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,050
last night?

303
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,070
 Don't you remember?

304
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,440
I totally blacked out.

305
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,580
 I saw you leaving while talking to Professor Heo on the phone, but...

306
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,020
 My Husband

307
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,800
 Where are you right now?

308
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,710
You're right.

309
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,130
You're right. That's what happened.

310
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,770
 Should I get you some coffee to wake you up?

311
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes, please.

312
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,190
Hey, Sun Yeong.

313
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,790
Aigoo, did you get up just now?

314
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,060
Yes. My head hurts so much.

315
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,430
 Seriously.

316
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,360
I told you not to drink so much.

317
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,190
Why did you drink so much last night?

318
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,620
I guess I was a bit excited after the first event.

319
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,030
Where are you?

320
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,380
 I'm at school, of course.

321
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,560
When did you go there?

322
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,940
 I left early this morning because I have lots of classes today.

323
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,090
Why didn't you wake me up?

324
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,170
 I'm sorry. I was too out of it this morning.

325
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,430
- I should've given you a wake-up call.
 - Professor.

326
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,720
Yes, yes.

327
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,570
I'm sorry, Honey. I'll call you later.

328
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,770
Yes, yes. Good luck with your classes.

329
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,780
What happened to Mr. Tidy?

330
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,580
I really didn't know.

331
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,830
I never even imagined it in my dreams.

332
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,000
I never thought she wouldn't be yours—

333
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,890
That's enough.

334
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,380
My gosh!

335
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,300
Sun Yeong, here...

336
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,460
Let go. Let go!

337
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,150
Do you think I'd believe that?

338
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:26,250
Did you even feel guilty toward me even a little bit?

339
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,940
You know,

340
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,660
my...

341
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,570
entire world was destroyed because of you.

342
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,330
But you...

343
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,800
talk about happiness while smiling?

344
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,870
Whenever you do that,

345
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,880
I...

346
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,910
hate you so much that I want to kill you.

347
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,590
Did you know?

348
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm sorry.

349
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,420
I'm so sorry.

350
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,120
No, Jae Won. It's too late.

351
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,740
What can I do for you?

352
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,680
What do you want me to do?

353
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,930
Give Ah Rin up.

354
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,090
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,510
I don't think I could do that.

356
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,780
Okay.

357
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,140
Fine.

358
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,210
Let's take this to the end, then.

359
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,980
- Can I hold her?
 - Of course.

 The World of Psychiatry

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,370
 Is it really possible

388
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,200
 the child might inherit the parent's condition?

389
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,600
 Mom, I'm scared. I'm cold.

390
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,550
- Ah Rin.
  - Dad.

391
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,620
Why? I'll just go to school for a moment.

392
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,940
That's why I'm saying I'll come with you.

393
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,480
But I'm going to work.

394
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,930
I can work there, too.

395
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,660
- You'll work there, too?
 - Yes.

396
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,820
Let me think about it.

397
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,600
Let's go.

398
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,530
- Here we are.
 - Wow, wow.

399
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,720
Here. I'll seriously consider it if you eat a lot of breakfast.

400
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,740
Please give me rice.

401
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,830
You have to finish it, though.

402
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,970
I'll think about it.

403
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,860
Thank you.

404
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,000
Do you want a sip of water?

405
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,920
Should I add this next?

406
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,270
 No Caller ID

407
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,190
 No Caller ID

408
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,350
Look at this bastard.

409
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,770
Did you send it?

410
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,960
- Seonbae?
 - Was it you?

411
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,160
- What do you mean?
 - What are you doing here right now?

412
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,410
I was told that Baek Seung Gyu's phone was acquired.

413
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,370
I'm supposed to meet him here.

414
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,370
You made it.

415
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,020
Both of you.

416
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,930
Wow.

417
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,630
Wow. We meet again, Mr. Yun Te Oh.

418
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,350
Enough with the pleasantries.

419
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,980
The CCTV footage from Baek Seung Gyu's building.

420
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,900
Where's that right now?

421
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,310
Why are you looking for that here?

422
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,000
Because one of you must know.

423
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,570
The one who attacked must know better than the one who was attacked.

424
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,090
Oh, no. I already deleted it.

425
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,950
Is that so?

426
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,380
I should deal with this matter at the police station, then.

427
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,690
But what should I bring with me?

428
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,480
Is the video of him getting beat up better, or

429
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,340
is Baek Seung Gyu's actual phone better?

430
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,650
Or should I bring in both of them?

431
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,470
Take whatever's light, so it's easy to carry.

432
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,990
Shit. Seonbae.

433
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,320
You can't just put me in a difficult position.

434
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,810
It'd be over if they found out I hid evidence.

435
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,520
Just keep your mouth shut.

436
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,310
Chairman Kwon Yeong Ik.

437
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,800
On that day, his daughter was caught on CCTV.

438
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,400
That mouth of yours. Geez...

439
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:25,060

440
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,860
Hello. You came during the day today.

441
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,070
You used to come at night.

442
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,130
How's he doing?

443
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,800
There isn't much to say for now.

444
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,240
Would he be able to wake up?

445
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,860
Don't lose hope.

446
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,900
It'll take time, but miracles happen sometimes.

447
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,680
I can't do it anymore.

448
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,400
I'll just... I'll just leave quietly.

449
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,550
I quit my job and put my apartment on the market, too.

450
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,200
Seung Gyu, what's with you? Don't be like that.

451
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,300
Is it because you need money? How much do you need?

452
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,290
That's enough! Please!

453
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,650
Gosh, seriously.

454
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,840
Thinking about what I did to CEO Seo because I was blinded by that damn money...

455
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,980
I can't continue doing this.

456
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,150
I won't.

457
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,750
Hey.

458
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,810
Don't get the wrong idea.

459
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,060
Do you think you'll be safe just because you're quitting now?

460
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,350
No.

461
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,830
Does your girlfriend know?

462
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,830
That you're a piece of trash like this?

463
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,040
What did you just say?

464
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,990
Say that again.

465
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,780
Yes, you're right.

466
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,340
Anyway, the whole company will find out soon once Ms. Seo finds the home camera footage.

467
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,400
Running away won't fix anything, either.

468
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,650
Why don't we just end it all here?

469
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,140
Seung Gyu. Seung Gyu...

470
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,260
- What are you doing? Don't! 
- This is better than people pointing fingers, don't you think?

471
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,800
Don't do this, Seung Gyu! Please! Don't!

472
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,770
Father.

473
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,500
I need you to help me.

474
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,850
S-Seung Gyu...

475
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,330
Seung Gyu fell from the rooftop.

476
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,750
It couldn't be helped because he threatened to kill us both.

477
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,640
 Is he dead?

478
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,520
I don't know.

479
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,620
Seung Gyu.

480
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,720
Am I really...

481
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,810
allowed to have hope?

482
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,600
 It starts now. Look forward to it. – Ami

483
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,030
 I really didn't know.

484
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,350
 I never even imagined it in my dreams.

485
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,210
 I never thought she wouldn't be yours...

486
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,500
 Do you really not know?

487
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,290
 What do you mean?

488
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,560
 I was going to endure until the end, even though our marriage was over, because

489
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,570
 you're my child's father.

00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,100
 Who's Baek Seung Gyu?

497
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,490
 I'll just ask the Chairman, then.

498
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,840
 He probably knows since he was the Yein Foundation's scholarship student.

Yes, I was wondering if you could look up texting history.

502
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,300
 I'll check your identity first and assist you.

503
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,410
Okay.

504
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,170
 Am I speaking to Mr. Heo Chi Yeong?

505
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,480
Who?

506
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,170
 Aren't you Mr. Heo Chi Yeong?

507
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,480
What's this all of a sudden?

508
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,410
I was worried because you didn't answer your phone.

509
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,710
I brought presents for Ah Rin.

510
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,700
What's this about?

511
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,200
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

512
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm busy.

513
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,200
I need to do research for the dissertation. Let's talk some other time.

514
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,140
Have you told Ah Rin about me?

515
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,590
You haven't, right?

516
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,490
When will you tell her?

517
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,220
Yun Jin.

518
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,620
Let's talk later, I said.

519
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,710
Sun Yeong.

520
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,320
Shouldn't you at least give me a chance to explain myself?

521
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,240
Okay.

522
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,170
Go ahead.

523
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,500
What exactly did you do with Baek Seung Gyu?

524
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,510
I did it out of anxiety.

525
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,080
I felt so anxious.

526
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,970
You said you'd break up, but don't you think I know you obsess over Jae Won?

527
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,010
I noticed our starter home was under Jae Won's father's name.

528
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,460
How do you think I felt when I found out?

529
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,130
That's why I asked Seung Gyu,

530
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,170
because he sees Jae Won at the office every day. That's all there is to it.

531
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,430
But he suddenly started acting out.

532
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:29,350
I tried to persuade him in person, but it didn't really work.

533
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,490
What did Seung Gyu do?

534
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,230
I don't really know, but

535
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,660
it seemed like he was under serious financial stress.

536
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,950
I helped him out a few times when I found out, but...

537
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,840
I guess he thought he could get a lot of money.

538
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,500
He started doing things I didn't ask for and kept threatening me.

539
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,770
It's true.

540
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,310
It's true, Sun Yeong. Please believe me.

541
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,080
Why did you pretend to be Heo Chi Yeong, then?

542
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,230
What are you talking about?

543
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,910
Of all people, why did you talk to Baek Seung Gyu with

544
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,910
a phone registered under Heo Chi Yeong's name?

545
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,690
Well, the thing is...

546
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,020
- The thing is— 
- Let's stop now.

547
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,130
Sun Yeong. Sun Yeong, please hear me out.

548
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,820
I kept thinking. Continuously.

549
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,410
I kept thinking about how I would be forgiven for what

550
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,160
I did to you.

551
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,790
What do you mean by that?

552
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,660
We're finished.

553
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,910
This is a warning. Don't visit Ah Rin's kindergarten.

554
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,170
I won't just sit still if you go there again without telling me.

555
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,760
Listen carefully.

556
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,530
A long, long time ago, there was a rabbit and a turtle.

557
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,370
May I come in?

558
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,150
You can't.

559
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,520
I'm here to take a dinner order.

560
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,790
I won't eat it.

561
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,730
I'm sorry.

562
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,410
Tell me what you're sorry about.

563
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,920
Can I tell you inside?

564
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,250
I see you were reading a book.

565
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,920
I've been too negligent lately, haven't I?

566
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,960
I didn't even know you were upset. Right?

567
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,080
I'm not angry because of that.

568
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,810
Why are you angry, then?

569
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,210
Because you told Dad to move out.

570
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,260
Ah Rin. That's because—

571
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,960
He cried a lot because he had a fight with his friend.

572
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,450
He was always there for me when I cried.

573
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:14,640
Mom, what if Dad cries outside again?

574
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,990
Neither you nor I will be there.

575
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,970
So don't tell him to move out.

576
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,910
Okay.

577
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,790
Promise.

578
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,310
Promise.

579
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,620
- Shall we go eat now?
 - Yes.

580
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,500
Let's go. Let's go eat, Ah Rin.

581
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,670
- Mom.
 - Yes?

582
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,400
Can I visit Seo Jun after I eat?

583
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,700
Of course, you can.

584
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,290
Let's go.

585
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,690
What are you doing here without notice?

586
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,880
That man came by again.

587
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,850
I'm talking about Nam Tae Ju.

588
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,540
You mean the one who took care of the CCTV footage?

589
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,050
Yes.

590
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,070
Come inside.

591
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,990
Would you like something to drink?

592
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,950
I'm feeling kind of down today.

593
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,870
- Do you want to drink beer like we used to?
 - No, I'm okay.

594
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,930
Yun Jin.

595
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,950
That man's way worse than you think.

596
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,850
Things will get more difficult for the Chairman at this rate.

597
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,060
Has it been about five that you've worked for my dad?

598
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,300
You don't seem to know my dad well yet.

599
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,850
Don't worry. Stuff like this won't faze him at all.

600
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,620
- Kwon Yun Jin.
 - How's Ha Jin's new hospital?

601
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,470
He's a great doctor.

602
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,330
I'm friendly with him, too.

603
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:14,630
I told him he's your son, and he said he'd take extra care.

604
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,170
Thank you.

605
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,430
And I'm sorry you always do favors for me.

606
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,830
You don't have to say that.

607
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,700
When is the test result coming out?

608
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,320
Will he get cured once he gets surgery?

609
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,560
Why don't you ever show me photos of your kids?

610
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,040
People with kids are always bragging about them.

611
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,670
You don't know how to do stuff like that.

612
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,720
Did you do this to Seung Gyu, too?

613
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,320
You always know

614
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,220
what I'm desperate about.

615
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,630
You always know and help me even if I don't say anything. Because you know

616
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,770
that would become my biggest weakness someday.

617
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,180
What are you talking about?

618
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,420
I can't believe what I'm hearing while helping out a friend.

619
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,030
Kwon Yun Jin.

620
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,990
You resemble your father.

621
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,120
I know you hate hearing this.

622
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,970
But he always treated Jae Won like that.

623
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,690
I'll get going.

624
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,460
Yes. All in, I said.

625
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,530
Already?

626
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,850
What do you mean, already, asshole?

627
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,030
Beer.

628
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,630
Don't say anything stupid and just send me the money.

629
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,810
I'll check in five minutes.

630
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,950
Seriously.

631
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,960
 This is Kwon Yun Jin.

632
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,040
 Yun Te Oh already knows.

633
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,150
Ah Rin isn't here.

634
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,880
She went over to Seo Jun's.

635
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,850
 Seoul Family Court

636
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,230
Let's wrap it up quietly.

637
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,210
Tell me if you want to set any conditions.

638
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,650
We'll do things the way you want.

639
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,540
I told you.

640
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,410
I just need Ah Rin.

641
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,190
You already know that won't happen.

642
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,210
Ah Rin...

643
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,810
isn't your daughter.

644
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,690
She's my daughter.

645
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,540
She's my daughter, no matter what anyone says.

646
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:59,810
So don't ever say that again.

647
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,730
Jae Won.

648
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,310
Dad.

649
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,360
What brings you here so late?

650
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,930
Is something going on?

651
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:39,010
No. I just wanted to see you.

652
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,580
Aigoo, seriously. Let's go inside.

653
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,890
You must think I'm still a kid.

654
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,920
Of course, you are.

655
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,820
To parents, their kids are little, no matter their age.

656
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,210
Go ahead and eat. You must be hungry.

657
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,340
Thanks for the meal.

658
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,790
It's tasty.

659
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,770
Dad.

660
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,730
Would you like some fruit?

661
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,270
Come and have a seat.

662
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,430
Aigoo.

663
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,300
Aigoo, aigoo...

664
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:08,900
I think he and I need to get divorced.

665
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,480
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

666
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,210
It must've been very difficult for you.

667
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,150
It's my fault.

668
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,540
It's not his fault, but mine.

669
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,900
Jae Won.

670
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,690
Don't try to do anything terrible like your mom.

671
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,410
I'm different from her.

672
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,170
I know.

673
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,640
Dad, when you were struggling because of Mom,

674
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,810
why didn't you leave her?

675
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,860
I know. I must've been crazy, too.

676
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,970
Even if she was crazy about gambling,

677
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,160
how could she give her child as collateral

678
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,800
to the debt collectors? She was out of her mind.

679
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,090
I really couldn't believe it.

680
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,680
- Did she do that?
 - Don't you remember?

681
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,700
Aigoo. I guess you only remember the good things since it was your mom.

682
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,360
April. Jeong Mi Hyang. Five million won.

683
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,540
Jeong Mi Hyang. Five million. Confirmed.

684
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,430
Mom, I want jjajangmyeon, too  (noodles with fermented black bean sauce).

685
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,040
I'll be back later and get it for you.

686
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,060
Hang out with these ahjeossis here for a second.

687
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,560
I'll be right back. Be good and wait, okay?

688
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,930
- Did you collect it?
 - Yes, I got four million.

689
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,960
Do it right.

690
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,650
There.

691
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,010
Last card for Mi Hyang.

692
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,260
Aigoo, that's quick. Look at this.

693
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,580
Yun Jin. Yun Jin.

694
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,460
- Ahjeossi.
 - Yes, yes. Are you okay?

695
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,410
What could I do for you?

696
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,900
This is for Mi Hyang.

697
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,110
Five million.

698
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,860
 Same-day Loan in Cash

699
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,930
Yun Jin.

700
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,870
Weren't you scared?

701
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,810
Let's go home now.

702
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,750
- I'm hungry.
- She didn't even feed you?

703
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,880
Those sons of bitches.

704
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,460
Ahjeossi, I want jjajangmyeon.

705
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,270
Jjajangmyeon?

706
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:01,360
I'm sorry, but all the jjajangmyeon places are closed now.

707
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,910
I'll make sure to get it for you tomorrow.

708
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,630
Let's eat at home tonight.

709
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,380
Instead, I'll make you rolled eggs and fried sausages, too.

710
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,010
Doesn't that sound good?

711
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,320
Sounds good.

712
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,130
Let's go home.

713
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,740
Okay.

714
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,730
 I knew Mom left,

715
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,150
but I guess I wasn't scared at all.

716
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,370
Because I knew you'd come get me.

717
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,830
That's why I couldn't leave.

718
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,050
I should go.

719
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,280
What? Are you leaving?

720
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,410
Yes, I need to go to work tomorrow.

721
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,170
Aigoo.

722
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,160
Be careful driving at night.

723
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,830
Dad.

724
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:17,180
Don't be sick and stay with me for a long time.

725
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,740
Okay. Aigoo.

726
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,250
Let's leave soon.

727
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,900
 Seoul Family Court

728
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,720
Honey.

729
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,860
I'm so scared.

730
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,030
I wonder...

731
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:22,180
what Ah Rin would think...

732
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:28,470
of this situation and...

733
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,670
how we are when she grows up.

734
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,920
What if she remembers me as a bad mom?

735
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,260
My Ah Rin...

736
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,740
My Ah Rin...

737
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,620
Please raise her well.

738
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,210
CEO, you came to work.

739
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,670
How are you feeling?

740
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:32,910
I'm fine. What's the schedule today?

741
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:37,330
Professor Heo said you need to rest for a few days.

742
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,560
So, I canceled everything this week.

743
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,290
Sun Yeong said that?

744
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,760
Yes.

745
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:46,740
Get everything back on schedule without missing anything.

746
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,040
Yes, I will.

747
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:52,520
Here's our bedding collection that will be released soon.

748
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,080
To get ahead in the bedding market,

749
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,410
we'll let the customers choose from the options

750
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:02,210
and let them customize their bedroom the way they want.

751
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,510
You mean you'll let the customers choose?

752
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,410
Yes, that's correct.

753
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,710
Let's do design preference research with our target audience.

754
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,210
Once we get the results,

755
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,550
we'll have the next meeting on the 17th.

756
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,290
The 17th?

757
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,100
Today is the 17th.

758
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,670
Wasn't today the 15th?

759
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,130
Today is the 17th, CEO.

760
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,690
Should we schedule the next meeting on the 19th, then?

761
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,280
Okay, then.

762
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,140
Did Team Leader Yun go to an offsite meeting?

763
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,030
He went to the expo in Busan.

764
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,210
He'll probably come back tomorrow.

765
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,200
Expo?

766
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,100
He didn't mention it when I saw him yesterday.

767
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,290
He left the day before yesterday since he'd be gone for four days.

768
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,380
CEO, is something wrong?

769
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:17,940
No. What time is the client meeting?

770
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,220
You need to leave right now.

771
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,770
Ah Rin, wash your hands. Let's eat.

772
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:34,410
What are you thinking about, Ah Rin?

773
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:38,100
I made your favorite. Fried rice.

774
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,520
- Dad.
 - Yes?

775
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,210
When is Mom coming back?

776
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,210
You know she's busy.

777
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:52,660
You should sleep with me tonight.

778
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,180
Oh? It's Mom!

779
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,160
 Ah Rin! Mom's home!

780
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,580
- Mom!
 - Ah Rin!

781
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,240
What did you do today? Did you have fun?

782
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,290
Mom, how could you not come home without telling me?

783
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,530
I was so busy with work. I'm so sorry.

784
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,970
Dad said you won't come home today, either.

785
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,960
You're a liar, Dad.

786
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,790
Did he? How strange.

787
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,380
Anyway, I'm sorry.

788
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,740
You have to sleep with me tonight instead.

789
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,350
- Okay.
 - Here.

790
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,870
- Promise.
 - Promise.

791
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,510
Ah Rin. Go wash your hands.

792
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,670
Okay.

793
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,080
Wash thoroughly.

794
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,960
Okay.

795
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,140
- Where have you been—
- I'm sorry, Honey.

796
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:45,150
I went to the hotel because I had more work, but I ended up falling asleep.

797
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,060
What are you talking about right now?

798
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,940
I'm so sorry.

799
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,490
I guess I've just been so busy signing contracts and having meetings.

800
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:57,910
Did you call Secretary Kim and tell her to cancel my schedule?

801
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,580
Well, Jae Won. Do you really—

802
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,360
Dad! I'm done washing my hands!

803
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,080
I'm so hungry right now. Can we talk after dinner?

804
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,420
Don't say there isn't food for me.

805
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,210
Were you very hungry, Ah Rin?

806
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:21,490
No. But food tastes so good today.

807
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,950
I think it's because I'm eating with both Mom and Dad.

808
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,900
Let's make sure the three of us eat dinner together from now on.

809
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,690
I'll come home early starting tomorrow.

810
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:38,040
Mom, Grandpa said you shouldn't make a promise you can't keep.

811
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,600
I'll try really hard this time.

812
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,130
Okay. I'll keep an eye on you.

813
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:50,110
Grandpa said we should go and catch a real big fish next time...

814
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,570
Mom, why are you holding Dad's hand?

815
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,240
You promised to sleep with me tonight.

816
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,040
It's not like that.

817
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,730
I'll sleep with you tonight, Ah Rin.

818
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:03,500
I'll stick right by you tonight.

819
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:09,040

820
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:16,670
♫  I could fly to the moon  ♫

821
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,920
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

822
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:28,770
♫  Could I know the hidden ending of the dark sky?  ♫

823
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,660

01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:36,740
♫  I could fly to the star  ♫

825
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,610
♫  There is a night like  ♫

826
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:46,000
♫  a lie hidden within it  ♫

827
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,560
♫  Following a darkened path  ♫

 My Happy Ending

829
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,500
 She showed up as a totally different person yesterday,

830
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,110
 as if nothing ever happened.

831
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,730
 I'm curious why she kept you close.

832
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:04,050
 We have a bit of a history.

833
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,070
 Are you interested?

834
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,410
 Do you take this yourself?

835
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:09,010
 No, my wife does.

836
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,980
 Her condition might be worsening now.

837
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,270
 Hey, Jae Won. Do you want to meet me for a second?

838
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,200
 Why are you still hanging around Jae Won?

839
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,790
 Because the situation changed.

840
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:20,740
 I was thinking of helping her,

841
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,290
 to do my duty as a friend.

842
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,850
 Jae Won. Seo Jae Won!

843
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,880
 Everything you took from me,

844
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,380
 I'll take all of it back.

845
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:36,090
