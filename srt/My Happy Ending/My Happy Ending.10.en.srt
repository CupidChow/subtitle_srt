10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,970
No, it's clean.

- Sunbaenim.
- Yes.

There's only one CCTV near the entrance, but it's broken.

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,150
But it was captured on CCTV on a big street a little away from here.

15
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,000
The time it was captured was 9:07 p.m.

Is he the one who called in?

19

Yes, he's a manager of the property.

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,200
He found him when he stopped by in the morning.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,620
Start questioning him. Look for more CCTVs nearby, too.

22

Got it, sir.

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,620
I heard he was Seo Jae Won's husband.

24
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,940
Well, yes. What's the cause of death?

25
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,310
I think it was poison.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,470
There's a sign he vomited.

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,800
But I think he was forced to take it since his wrist has a strap mark.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,290
You mean it was a foul play.

29
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,230
Yes. Aigoo. He must've been in pain the moment he died.

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,910
It appears he died at 1:42 a.m.

31
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,710
He had a smartwatch.

You purchased pesticides recently, right?

48
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,060
We found pesticide in the water bottle in the vehicle.

Don't you understand what I'm saying?

Mr. Heo Sun Yeong was poisoned.

51
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,940
It was banned from sale because it's highly poisonous and has no color or odor.

52
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,170
You purchased it through your father's acquaintance, who runs a pesticide company, right?

We already got his testimony, too.

54

And there's a record of Ms. Seo purchasing the pesticide with the same ingredients.

69
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,500
She won't say why she purchased it or what she used it for. So, there's no way to know.

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,640
The bigger issue is that it'd be difficult to prove her alibi when the incident happened.

It's regarding her mental illness, apparently.

There's a reporter named Choi Do Hun who's been chasing after CEO Seo.

You couldn't even stop a reporter? What have you been doing?

83
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,220

Can you handle Dereve without Seo Jae Won?

86
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,500
To convince the investors on CEO Seo's side,

87
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,180
we'll have to access the ledger or request a copy of it.

88
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,020
You think they'll be willing to give it to us?

89
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,020
We'll have to request an injunction if they refuse.

90
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,710
The sales have dropped significantly recently, and the brand image has been damaged, too.

91
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,440
The court will accept it if we prove that her ability to run a business needs to be questioned.

92
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,120
I'll prepare a shareholders' meeting as soon as possible.

93
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,280
Because CEO Seo didn't create Dereve on her own.

94

They want to fire the CEO?

95
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,880
I heard they'll have a shareholders' meeting soon, replace the directors who support Ms. Seo,

96
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,590

Director Park.

We need to save the company first.

103
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,030
Are you saying the company will crumble because of Ms. Seo?

104
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,110
Everyone's talking about that on the news and the internet.

105

"Dereve's CEO, Seo Jae Won, was arrested as a suspect in a murder."

106
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,420
How long do you think we could last at this rate?

107
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,980
The powerless employees are the first to suffer the damage when the sales go down.

108
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,930
- I don't think Ms. Seo wants that, either.
- I see.

109
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,620
That's why you went to see the chairman first and foremost to remove her, right?

110
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,720
Team Leader Yun!

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,270
She'll be acquitted soon.

112
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,570
Don't act rashly.

113
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,250
The investigation will continue tomorrow morning.

114
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,970

116
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,010

117
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,940

Oppa.

120
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,370
Will you keep refusing to eat?

121
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,370
I know you're upset, but you need to eat at times like this.

122
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,940
Later. I'll eat later.

123
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,890

126
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,890
His husband even tried to leak her company's design.

127
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,110
I think that's enough for the murder motive.

128
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,450
If she planned the murder using pesticide...

Do you know about Professor Heo and Kwon Yun Jin's relationship?

151
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,210
Of course I do.

152
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,580
We already confirmed her alibi, too.

153
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,460
She was at a bar when Mr. Heo was suspected to have died.

154
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,510
We got testimony from her friends, too.

155

Even if she wasn't at the scene,

156
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,960
she could've put pesticide in the water bottle earlier.

157
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,520
You said the inside of the car was cleaned after Mr. Heo died.

158
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,560
How will you explain not a single fingerprint in the car?

159
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,890
There might've been an accomplice or...

Wow. You're really taking this too far.

I told Yun Te Oh that you have an alibi like you asked me to.

177
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,660
Good work.

178
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,620
By the way, how much are you involved in this?

179
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:10,290
The factory property where this case happened is where your cold case happened.

180
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,700
By chance...

181
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,980
It can't be, right?

182
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,030
You think I killed him?

183
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,250
I mean...

184
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,510
Do you think Seo Jae Won killed her husband?

185
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,930
Just look at how the situation is going.

186
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,560
Anyone would say Seo Jae Won is the culprit.

187
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,710
Sunbaenim, what do you think about it?

188
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,320
I don't know. We'll find out eventually.

189
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,050
By the way,
[Physical evidence]

190
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,540
Heo Sun Yeong's phone is missing from the list of belongings.

191
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,010
Was it never there?

192
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,460
She must've gotten rid of it if it was a premeditated murder.

193
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,270
You think Seo Jae Won did that?

194
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,880
- All done?
- Yes, it's done.

195
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
Carry on, then.

196
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,640
I heard there has been a commotion.

197
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,100
Would the minister hearing go okay?

198
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,470
Mr. Kim is very worried about it.

199
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,010
It won't be an issue.

200
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,350
I will not let you lose face for recommending me.

201
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,290
Of course.

202
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,950
You have to watch out for even a falling leaf right now.

203
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,120
By the way, why are you trying to shake the tree yourself?

204
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,420
What do you mean by that?

205
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm talking about CEO Seo Jae Won.

206
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,140
What's the reason you took care of her yourself?

207
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,920
I learned about it from the news, too.

208
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,730
Chairman Kwon,

209
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,010
you're ready to become a politician now.

210
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,050
You have a good poker face, unlike your father.

211
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,920
If you've decided to abandon the sword you've been using,

212
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,440
make sure to break it properly.

213
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,470
A rusty sword hurts the most.

214
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,430
Police Chief.

215
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,740
I suppose you came to say hello to him, too.

216
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,710
Yes. Looks like you beat me to it.

217
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,780
Let's have a gathering soon.

218
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,550
Sounds good.

219
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,020
I don't like your questioning like this without clear evidence.

220
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,240
So, I'm asking where she was at the time.

221
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,940
How many times did I tell you?

222
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,040
She fell asleep in the car since she didn't feel well that day.

223
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,940
And she went to the hotel when she woke up at night.

224
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,050
What are the odds? You mean she fell asleep with the car off, so the dash cam doesn't work.

225
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,040
And it had to be when Mr. Heo died.

226
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,610
Let's be honest. How do we know if she actually fell asleep

227
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,340
or parked the car somewhere and killed someone?

228
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,900
You even prepared for a divorce lawsuit with him recently.

229
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,150
Why would you ask us that?

230
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,020
And the divorce is separate from this case. Don't speculate.

231
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,380
The sale of pesticides was banned, but you can easily get them from the manufacturer. You know, right?

232
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,730
That's why I'm asking her to say something.

233
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,870
Why did you buy the pesticide?

234
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,260
What did you use it for?

235
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,000
Why did I not know?

236
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,750
I could've known easily. Easily...

237
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,250
H-How come I didn't notice it?

238
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,320
Since when...

239
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,700
Since when, since when, since when?

240
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,050
How did it go?

241
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,710
It's frustrating because Ms. Seo won't say why she bought the pesticide.

242
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,240
She needs to talk so I can do something.

243
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,340
I don't know why she's remaining silent.

244
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,190
Did they find additional evidence?

245
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,070
Not yet. I think the detective is forcing it since they don't have conclusive evidence.

246
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,940
We can look forward to her being released soon for lack of evidence.

247
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,880
How's she right now? She's okay, right?

248
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,980
I'm not sure how to describe this.

249
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,320
Ms. Seo Jae Won...

250
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,470
is kind of strange right now.

251
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,590
Did she have medicine in her possession?

252
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,080
Medicine?

253
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,640
What medicine?

254
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,520
Never mind.

255
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,200
Gosh, why do you think she's doing that?

256
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,660
I'm not sure.

257
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,770
I heard she requested to have a visitor. Did you hear?

258
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,230
What?

259
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,240
Jae Won, are you okay?

260
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,300
It was that day seven years ago.

261
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,680
I definitely saw it at the event venue, too. Why didn't I think of that?

262
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,620
It was definitely there when I received a basket of flowers. Yes.

263
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,330
Seo Jae Won...

264
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,300
I'll leave now.

265
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,440
It's you, isn't it?

266
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,970
Ami.

267
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,430
Why didn't I know?

268
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,470
You've always...

269
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,400
been by my side.

270
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,190
You desired what I had.

271
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,380
In order to take what I had,

272
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,870
you've been circling around my family and me.

273
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,490
Since seven years ago and until now.

274
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,870
What are you talking about?

275
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,740
Ami?

276
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,850
What's that, anyway?

277
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,750
You're the one...

278
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,150
who killed Sun Yeong, right?

279
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,030
Jae Won,

280
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,070
I know you're very sick,

281
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,490
but be careful what you say.

282
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,720
Who killed whom, exactly?

283
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,270
No, no, no...

284
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,780
I got all of my memories back.

285
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,880
Then, you also must know now.

286
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,520
Sun Yeong and I used to love each other-

287
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,860
You're always by Seo Jae Won's side without fail.

288
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,170
I can say the same about you.

289
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,910
You even used Baek Seung Gyu.

290
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,990
People are so imaginative.

291
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,340
Do they actually say I did that? Why would I?

292
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,080
You're making me even more curious.

293
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,530
What makes you so shameless like this?

294
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,620
Don't you know there's no going back anymore?

295
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,690
I was never interested in going back, to begin with.

296
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,050
Go inside.

297
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,190
Jae Won seems to be struggling a lot.

298
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,190
Make sure to comfort her a lot.

299
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,130
You're being released because of a lack of evidence.

300
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,260
Don't think you're acquitted yet.

301
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,350
Make sure to come when we call you for additional questioning.

302
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,780
Let's go.

303
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,260
Here she comes!

304
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,890
- It's Seo Jae Won!
- Seo Jae Won's here.

305
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,120
Here she comes! Here she comes!

306
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,550
Excuse me.

307
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,390
Ms. Seo, do you admit to murdering your husband?

308
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,980
Why did you purchase the pesticide?

309
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,260
How do you feel right now?

310
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,150
I'll send out a press release. Please make a way.

311
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,090
Your daughter lost her dad.

312
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,040
Don't you feel bad for her?

313
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,340
Do you have any sense of guilt?

314
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,510
How do you feel?

315
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,910
Ms. Seo!

316
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,500
Where should we take you?

317
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,890
There are reporters at the office and at your house.

318
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,000
Same with the hotel.

319
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,690
Let's go to my place. That would be better.

320
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,070
How did I get out?

321
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,130
Because you didn't commit any crime.

322
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,650
I'll get going now, then.

323
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,300
Thank you, Secretary Kim.

324
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,120
I just did my job. Don't mention it.

325
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,330
Take good care of yourself, Ms. Seo.

326
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,290
Thanks a lot, Seong Hui.

327
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,860
I can stay at the studio. Don't worry about me.

328
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,240
I told my sister in advance, too.

329
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,700
What?

330
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,260
Do you not want to?

331
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,140
I miss Ah Rin.

332
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,140
♫ Doesn't matter after all ♫

333
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,850
My...

334
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,660
entire world was destroyed because of you.

335
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,660
I hated you so much that I wanted to kill you.

336
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Did you know?

337
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,020
I might've actually wanted...

338
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,190
you not to get your memory back.

339
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,250
Because I thought I won't ever have this again.

340
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,960
You, me, and our Ah Rin.

341
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,130
The three of us spending time like this.

342
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,480
I should've trusted you until the end. But I couldn't.

343
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm sorry.

345
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,110
Pull over for a second.

346
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,540
♫ Whatever the greeting ♫

347
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,850
I killed him.

348
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,980
I killed him.

349
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,580
No.

350
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,400
No...

351
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,300
Sun Yeong, no...

352
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,390
I killed you.

355
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:21,320
♫ Can make love scars just disappear? ♫

356
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,280
♫ But when I close my eyes ♫

357
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,730
Get some sleep if you're tired.

358
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,860
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

359
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,520
It's okay.

360
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,600
Do you need anything?

361
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,700
No.

362
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,500
Are you hungry, then?

363
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,900
♫ In the days I whispered ♫

364
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,240
Do you have water?

365
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,220
Yes. Just one second.

366
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,160
Here.

367
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:04,040
♫ Will you come around a while ♫

368
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,960
I was scared...

369
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,770
they might find out about my illness

370
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,150
since I didn't take the medicine in a while.

371
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,240
Can they not?

372
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,360
Why do you have to hide it?

373
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,710
It's not your fault.

374
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,120
Because I thought that was the way to protect myself.

375
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,810
You can leave now.

376
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,250
Thank you.

377
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,960
And I'm sorry again.

378
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,110
Don't think about anything and just rest today.

379
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,400
Don't watch TV.

380
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,950
Don't listen to others or have negative thoughts.

381
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,180
And don't be sick, either.

382
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,290
That's a lot.

383
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm just saying.

384
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,170
I'm right here.

385
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,700
In front of you.

386
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,910
Drive safely.

387
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,860
Dad.

388
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,460
Jae-

389
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,290
J-Jae Won.

390
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,810
Aigoo, Jae Won.

391
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,620
Jae Won.

392
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,160
Wasn't it difficult to get here?

393
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,440
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

394
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,100
No, no. What are you talking about?

395
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,600
Let's go inside for now. Come on.

396
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,870
[Seo Yun Jin]

397
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,980
Here.
[Seo Yun Jin]

398
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,240
Make sure to keep it for generations.

399
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,560
I made sure Baek Seung Gyu couldn't wake up for a while.

400
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,000
But it's unclear if we can continue since the hospital strengthened security.

401
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,890
Keep an eye on him.

402
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,230
Yes.

403
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,200
You don't exist in this world.

404
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,490
- You know, right?
- Yes.

405
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,070
I can't stop looking at this.

406
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,140
It has mythological qualities to it.

407
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,710
Don't be pretentious and...

408
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,760
get to the point.

409
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,420
Straight to the point. I like that.

410
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,390
I like things that are straightforward, too.

411
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,490
Simple and clear.

412
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,800
But I can't stand it when people cut in without using a turn signal.

413
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,350
Just so you know.

414
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm glad to hear that.

415
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,530
At least, we have one thing in common.

416
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,400
Okay. What should we do now?

417
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,160
Yun Te Oh is giving me a headache by poking around here and there.

418
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,670
I don't think I'll just let him do that anymore.

419
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,810
Just take care of Seo Jae Won. Just Seo Jae Won.

420
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,200
Don't touch Yun Te Oh.

421
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Are you going to switch to him?

422
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,280
You'd better not...

423
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,320
cross the line, either.

424
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,590
Okay. I'll just do as I'm told.

425
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,000
If so... Here I go!

426
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Where did she go?

427
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,690
Jae Won.

428
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,890
Jae Won.

429
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,130
Jae Won!

430
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,790
Jae Won!

431
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,540
- What brings you here?
- Is there something wrong...

432
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,250
- Where's Ms. Seo?
- She came last night.

433
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,990
But she disappeared this morning.

434
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,510
Stay at home. I'll look for her.

435
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,440
I'll look, too.

436
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,370
Jae Won.

437
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,490
How did it go?

438
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,690
I logged in with her ID just in case

439
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,280
and there was a card payment record. So I checked.

440
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,810
She just bought a bus ticket to Samcheok.

441
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,530
Okay. Got it.

442
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,270
Yun Jin.

443
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,000
Mom!

444
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,640
You waited for long, didn't you?

445
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,340
No.

446
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,900
Why are you smiling?

447
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,740
It's nothing. I'm just happy that you're smiling.

448
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,030
Here.

449
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,480
Get me a carton of milk at the store over there.

450
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,750
What kind of milk?

451
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,970
Strawberry milk. Your favorite.

452
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,550
Okay.

453
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,350
I'll be right back.

454
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,120
Here. Go ahead and drink it.

455
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,500
Go ahead.

456
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,680
Aren't you thirsty?

457
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,080
Hurry up and drink it.

458
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,820
It's your favorite.

459
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,720
Here.

460
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,600
It's my...

461
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,980
only wish.

462
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,060
Drink it.

463
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,330
I'm sorry.

464
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,060
But...

465
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,570
I couldn't help it.

466
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,650
Don't worry.

467
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,230
It'd be nothing once you get some sleep.

468
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,580
Mom.

469
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,860
I'm so sleepy.

470
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,560
There's a term called "tunnel vision."

471
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,560
A driver who's driving inside a dark tunnel

472
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,600
can't see anything but the light coming out of the exit he's heading toward.

473
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,940
The people who commit suicide often have tunnel vision.

474
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,060
They can't see their surroundings clearly because they're obsessed with the issue they're facing.

475
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:11,400
They end up thinking there's only one way to be free from pain.

476
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,650
Ending everything themselves.

477
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:20,380
They end up believing that's the only way to the exit by following the light.

478
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,030
♫ Only if I don't ♫

479
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,120
♫ In between the empty darkness ♫

480
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,960
♫ I wanna know. You blow in. ♫

481
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:43,220
♫ I wanna know ♫

482
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,270
♫ I'm not okay. I can feel your touch. ♫

483
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,620
♫ A huge wave of memories are coming in ♫

484
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,180
Mom.

485
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,190
I'm cold.

486
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,220
Hang in there for a moment.

487
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,640
We'll soon...

488
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,260
have a happy ending.

489
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,720
♫ The conclusion that had stalled along with the truth ♫

490
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,630
♫ Would you look back to this moment then? ♫

491
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:23,390
♫ I wanna know. You blow in. ♫

492
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,020
Mom.

493
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,690
Is this really the happy ending?

494
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,650
♫ I'm not okay. I can feel your touch. ♫

495
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,550
♫ A huge wave of memories are coming in ♫

496
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,500
♫ I'm not okay. I can hear your voice. ♫

497
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,740
♫ I picture us seeing each other in my dream ♫

498
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,620
♫ I'm left alone in the darkness ♫

499
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,440
♫ Looking for you, the light, and roam in the dream ♫

500
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,340
♫ I'm left alone in the darkness ♫

501
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,810
♫ Looking for you, the light ♫

502
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,370
♫ I'm not okay. I can feel your touch. ♫

503
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:16,250
♫ A huge wave of memories are coming in ♫

504
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,150
♫ I'm not okay. I can hear your voice. ♫

505
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:26,400
♫ I picture us seeing each other in my dream ♫

506
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,050
Mom.

507
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,710
I won't forget...

508
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,440
that day and this ocean.

509
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,810
I won't run away.

510
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,150
Seo Jae Won!

511
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,920
Seo Jae Won!

512
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,920
What are you doing here?

513
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,210
Get off.

514
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,900
- Let's talk for a second.
- I have nothing to say.

515
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,840
Don't disappear without a word again.

516
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,460
I won't hold back then.

517
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,630
I swear it's not like that.

518
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,950
I wasn't trying to die.

519
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,330
You should've answered my call, then.

520
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,020
Do you know how scared I was?

521
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,470
Don't do stuff like that.

522
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,490
I won't ask anything from you.

523
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:55,700
I won't even ask you to look at me. So...

524
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,540
So, please...

525
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,780
just don't disappear from my sight.

526
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,700
Let me ask you a favor, then.

527
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,550
Please take care of my Ah Rin.

528
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,830
What do you mean?

529
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,420
You're being serious again.

530
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,930
I can't always be next to her.

531
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,610
I don't know how the situation would change, either.

532
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,880
Please?

533
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,510
Are you in a bad mood today, Ah Rin?

534
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,590
Did something happen?

535

- Yeah.

539
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:03,850
My teacher said your wish would come true if you prayed to the supermoon.

540
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:08,840

Tell me.

I'll make sure it comes true.

546

01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,990
They might not have anything to do with me...

715
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:52,430
You want to believe it's not true, right?

716
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,640
Why didn't you take the medicine?

717
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,600
There was an important presentation.

718
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,400
I thought a few days would be fine.

719
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,480
You should accept it now.

720
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,190
Your relationship with Heo Sun Yeong is over.

721
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,810
Su Gyeong.

722
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,480
I'm sorry for making a difficult request.

723
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,640
Let's have dinner together afterward.

724
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,780
The number you dialed does not exist.

725
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,770
Please check and dial again.

726
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,590
Just one moment.

727
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,970
I'm different from Mom.

728
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,220
I'll never end things this way.

729
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,180
♫ Why would it happen? ♫

730
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:23,180
♫ Like how it all has been connected ♫

731
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,960
♫ Only if I don't ♫

732
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,070
♫ In between the empty darkness ♫

733
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:37,800
♫ I wanna know. You blow in. ♫

734
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:46,070
♫ I wanna know ♫

735
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:50,090
♫ I'm not okay. I can feel your touch. ♫

736
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,960
♫ A huge wave of memories are coming in ♫

737
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,810
♫ I'm not okay. I can hear your voice. ♫

738
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:03,810
♫ I picture us seeing each other in my dream ♫

739
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:11,540
♫ The conclusion that had stalled along with the truth ♫

740
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,440
♫ Would you look back ♫

741
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,530
[My Happy Ending]

742
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,870
Time to take your medicine, Ms. Seo Jae Won.

743
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:25,320
I think I have a lot of things to do once I get discharged.

744
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,000
I heard you'll be the artist for Dereve's project.

745
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,290
Good luck with it. It's your company from now on, too.

746
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,700
Please keep an eye on them.

747
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,670
You never know what Kwon Yun Jin and Kwon Yeong Ik would do.

748
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,850
I heard Heo Sun Yeong's case will have a new detective in charge.

749
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,170
I think you should watch out.

750
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:42,210
How could you use an innocent child as a shield?

751
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,270
She was mine from the beginning.

752
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,610
How should I take care of it?

753
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,110
Let me manage it myself.

754
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:53,190
I'm making plans and getting things done one by one starting now.
