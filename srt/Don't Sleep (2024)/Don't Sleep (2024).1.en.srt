1
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:48,005
Don't make any loud noise.

2
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,160
Otherwise, mom will wake up.

3
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,294
Can we really talk to dad by using this?

4
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,021
Actually, I see Mom doing it often.

5
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,921
Just talking to dad alone.

6
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:30,056
When we will have
lighten up these candles,

7
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,683
and while talking to dad.

8
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,631
We must touch our fingers to
the inverted glass on the board.

9
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,782
All the time!

10
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,827
Otherwise the ghost may haunt us.

11
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,710
Belle, what's going on?

12
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:39,789
Don't say anything.

13
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:42,483
Dad, are you here?

14
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,449
Belle!

15
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,345
Belle!

16
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:11,821
Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam!

17
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:12,846
Sam!

18
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,012
Sam, what's wrong, dear?

19
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,441
Sam! Sam!

20
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,472
Belle!

21
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,500
Belle! Belle! Belle! Belle!

22
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,018
Belle!

23
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:22,793
Belle! What's wrong,
dear? Belle, dear!

24
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:24,472
Belle! Belle!

25
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,746
Why are you playing
with my stuff like this?

26
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,361
May I ask?

27
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:56,374
Recently...

28
00:03:57,244 --> 00:04:01,730
you tried to contact your
mother by yourself, right?

29
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,486
Yes, I did.

30
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,164
But she never talk back to me.

31
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,278
So...

32
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,865
I hope you could
help me with this.

33
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,421
About these cards,

34
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,825
there is nothing much to worry...

35
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:26,007
but the last card telling me that
there is something or some spirit...

36
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:27,975
that’s following you.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,250
And it wants something from you,

38
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,500
but I still don't
know what it wants.

39
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:57,382
Hello Sam.

40
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:00,653
What?

41
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:03,497
What did you say?

42
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:05,663
I can't hear you.

43
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,291
Okay, okay, I'll hurry.

44
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,275
What happened, Sam?

45
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,244
Belle,

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,916
I have no where left to go.

47
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,802
There’s something...

48
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,932
that’s following me.

49
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,929
Are you serious?

50
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,275
Sorry, Sam.

51
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:19,744
Danny is calling.

52
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,322
I will be back in a sec, okay?

53
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,770
- Hello.
- Hey.

54
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,270
Where are you now?

55
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:48,148
When will you be back?

56
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:49,958
Sorry,

57
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:51,878
something went wrong. Sam’s in trouble.

58
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:55,435
It seems like it's a big deal.

59
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:58,536
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

60
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,332
You should bring your
sister here with you first.

61
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,168
Then we can talk.

62
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,792
Sam!

63
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,353
Wake up, Sam!

64
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,878
Belle! Belle!

65
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,170
Belle, it's here! Belle, it's here!

66
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,510
It's come here!

67
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,773
- It's here!
- Sam, calm down.

68
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,824
I'm here now.

69
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,147
If you want to rest.

70
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,696
You can use the
room over there, and...

71
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:35,911
Ah,

72
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:37,687
sorry, there's a party today.

73
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,133
It's going to be a little chaotic.

74
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,558
All my friends are drunk.

75
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,874
Hey Sam!

76
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:45,045
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

77
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:48,551
Happy birthday, Ton.

78
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,118
Thank you.

79
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,750
Join me at the party, this way.

80
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,736
I have liquor, drug,

81
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:55,375
- marijuana-
- Hey!

82
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Ton!

83
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,775
She's still young.

84
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,794
Look at her.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,625
Sam is really tired.

86
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,928
Let her rest.

87
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:04,268
And you...

88
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,559
don’t party for too long tonight.

89
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,625
Do you understand?

90
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,730
End the party tonight okay?

91
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,755
Let's go Sam.

92
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:11,368
Yes ma’am.

93
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,622
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

94
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,827
One more!

95
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,791
Why are you standing here alone?

96
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,500
So cute, what's your name?

97
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,747
Let's get some air together, shall we?

98
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,083
Sam.

99
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:50,594
Is everything okay?

100
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,958
Tell me what’s happening?

101
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,250
I bring it home.

102
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,833
I’m sorry.

103
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,708
So, tell me what is this drawing?

104
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,824
This is it.

105
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,583
It?

106
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,458
Who?

107
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:02,333
Who is this girl in your drawing?

108
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,410
Belle?

109
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,183
Don’t you remember?

110
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,833
Remember what?

111
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,711
Just tell me who is she?

112
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:41,805
What?

113
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,250
So you rummaged her things?

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,125
No, no, no, no, no.

115
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:47,690
Stop talking!

116
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,333
That’s not a point.

117
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,875
The point is...

118
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,375
WHAT

119
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:55,558
IS

120
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,583
IT?

121
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:00,848
So, what is it?

122
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,631
Alright!

123
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,268
Alright?

124
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:12,808
Is it interesting?

125
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,921
Drunk like a dog like this.

126
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,125
Let's play a ghost hunting.

127
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,808
And then we will send our story
to the ghost podcast channel.

128
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,254
I think we will get famous like...

129
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,420
Boom! Boom! Boom!

130
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:27,891
You’re crazy now, Ton.

131
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,320
Sam is kinda weird recently.

132
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,313
But you still stole her Pee
Tuay Gaew to play now?

133
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,228
Let’s go to bed, guys.

134
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,253
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:40,278
Hey, wait a minute.

136
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:41,303
Hey, hey.

137
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,426
Just for fun bro, don’t take it serious.

138
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:51,429
I think...

139
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,143
It’s not a big deal...

140
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,458
to play it once.

141
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:05,804
Come!

142
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,529
It’s really cool, man!

143
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,031
I'm not Few.

144
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:34,867
What are you laughing at?

145
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,619
Shit, it's so cool.

146
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,066
Ton!

147
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,285
That's enough.

148
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:55,921
What the hell are you doing?

149
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,032
Did you know that it's dangerous?

150
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,686
Yo, girl.

151
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,113
Take it easy.

152
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,607
Just have fun playing.

153
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,049
Alright!

154
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,120
That's enough for today.

155
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:08,869
The party's over.

156
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,390
Ton.

157
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:11,521
Stop playing around.

158
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:13,556
You should go back home now.

159
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,521
Come here.

160
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,462
I told you already, right?

161
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:48,069
Rath?

162
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:49,695
Rath?

163
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,104
Rath?

164
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,417
Are you okay?

165
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:58,756
Are you drunk?

166
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:00,402
Why come home this late?

167
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:03,894
I’m fine.

168
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:07,673
I let you work and
take care of yourself.

169
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,291
But you came back
home drunk like this?

170
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,997
How can you graduate
if you behave like this?

171
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:14,800
You’d better graduate this year.

172
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,002
Don’t you think that
earning money by yourself

173
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,918
would make me let you
do whatever you want?

174
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,170
Hello?

175
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,195
I'm speaking.

176
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:27,702
What!

177
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,041
How many bodies?

178
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,328
I’ll be there right away.

179
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,583
Music has seven elements.

180
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,708
Anybody know what are those elements?

181
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,975
First...

182
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,958
rhythm, right?

183
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,471
Second is...

184
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,126
melody.

185
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,125
Understand?

186
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,833
Do anybody know what is next?

187
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,708
Suchanart?

188
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,649
Would you mind answering this?

189
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,750
Melody? That’s previous answer.

190
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:15,808
Alright.

191
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,158
Songsak, Do you know the answer?

192
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Harmony? Correct!

193
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,708
Good job.

194
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,819
It’s harmony.

195
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,208
The next one.

196
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,999
Can you tell me what
is the next one, Peemai?

197
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,083
The fourth elements.

198
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,583
What is the fourth Wasana?

199
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:36,031
Rath!

200
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,112
Rath!

201
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,196
Why did you do that Rath!?

202
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:41,445
Call the ambulance!

203
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:43,437
- Shit!
- Rath!

204
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,574
Call the ambulance!

205
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,124
Don’t stand still! Call the ambulance!

206
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,666
Wan.

207
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,666
Play like what I just taught
your friend before, okay?

208
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:56,954
Stop!

209
00:19:58,653 --> 00:19:59,653
Rath!

210
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,259
- Rath!
- Rath!

211
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,622
Go get the teacher!

212
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:05,641
Step back, Please step back everybody.

213
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,541
Everybody move, Let me in please.

214
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,771
Rath.

215
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,490
You damn kid!

216
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:02,365
Come here, what did you give him to eat?

217
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,310
What did you do to him?
Why he commited suicide?!

218
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:05,703
Why he commited suicide?!

219
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:06,922
Come here.

220
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:07,947
Come here!

221
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,591
Why did he committed suicide?!

222
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:14,243
What the heck, old man?!

223
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:15,973
Who died?

224
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,088
Watch your tone, kid!!

225
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,779
Do you know?

226
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:22,202
Rath is dead.

227
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,027
Wait, wait, wait!

228
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,492
What is this all about?

229
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,119
So, what is this?

230
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:30,776
It's a card.

231
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:31,801
Card?!

232
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:35,723
Let my brother go.

233
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:37,502
He doesn't know anything.

234
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,313
But I can tell you who know
something about these things.

235
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:42,516
Then take me there!

236
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:44,454
Yes, sir.

237
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:48,634
What!

238
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,659
Rath is dead!?

239
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:50,927
It’s true.

240
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:53,353
There was some kind of fortune
teller's card on his body too.

241
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:55,431
The fortune teller’s card
that Sam mentioned before.

242
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm taking Rath’s dad
to see the fortune teller.

243
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:58,633
I think you should come too.

244
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:00,522
I'll send you the location.

245
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,274
Well, I'll get dressed
in a moment. See you.

246
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:16,013
Sam.

247
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:18,742
Mhom.

248
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,490
What happened?

249
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:24,976
What does it mean?

250
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,429
Is there something Sam hasn’t told me yet?

251
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:28,694
Nothing.

252
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,037
- What happened?
- Right now,

253
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,117
all your friends are in danger.

254
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,403
The only way to help right now is...

255
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,209
you need to hurry
back to help your friends.

256
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,320
And I will follow.

257
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,168
I’ll go pack my things for a moment.

258
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,107
Okay. Okay.

259
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:33,377
Which one is Mhom.

260
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,875
One thing I can tell

261
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,416
now, he’s in the spirit world.

262
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,025
- Spirit world?
- Yes.

263
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,800
Those spirits are wandering spirit.

264
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,034
They have nowhere to go.

265
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,064
They just want to stay alive again.

266
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,555
What the hell are you talking about?

267
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,664
It’s fact.

268
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,720
So, bring me to spirit world.

269
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,060
I don’t recommend.

270
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,811
I’ve never think about
bringing anyone there

271
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:06,936
because I don’t know
it would work or not

272
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,495
You're not bringing
me there, are you?

273
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,186
I will try.

274
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,573
I will try to bring you there.

275
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,174
Are you okay?

276
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:52,139
I’m okay.

277
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,138
Shall we go dancing?

278
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,388
Let’s go.

279
00:25:57,972 --> 00:25:59,763
Come on.

280
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,585
Do you know how to play?

281
00:26:58,912 --> 00:26:59,913
I know.

282
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:03,172
Yes.

283
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,863
It's played like this.

284
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:08,230
And?

285
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:11,255
You place your finger
at the bottom of glass.

286
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,283
Yes.

287
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:17,308
And repeat after me.

288
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:19,155
Close your eyes.

289
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,347
Close your eyes.

290
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,472
Then.

291
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:25,222
Take a deep breath.

292
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:28,286
And keep trying call your son’s name.

293
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:33,725
Rath?

294
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,431
Rath?

295
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:38,812
Rath?

296
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:40,045
Can you hear me?

297
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:45,668
Nothing happen!

298
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:47,770
Wait a minute.

299
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:54,476
Now it’s clear.

300
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:55,776
You can definitely see it.

301
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,426
Try again.

302
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:06,303
Rath?

303
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:08,213
Rath?

304
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:11,654
Rath?

305
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:12,927
Rath?

306
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,303
Where are you?

307
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:25,733
Rath?

308
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,397
Rath?

309
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:29,863
Rath?

310
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,773
- Rath?
- Can’t you hear?

311
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:35,058
Someone calls your name.

312
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:36,663
Can you hear me?

313
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:40,923
I don’t know where I should go.

314
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:43,786
Try to listen and follow it.

315
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,366
Rath?

316
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:47,944
Can you hear me?

317
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:50,637
Rath?

318
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:52,311
Where are you?

319
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,475
Follow me.

320
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Rath?

321
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,549
Rath?

322
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,021
Rath?

323
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,690
Rath?

324
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:03,873
Can you hear me?

325
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,397
Rath, is that you?

326
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:13,936
Rath, right?

327
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,686
Dad!

328
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:27,820
Let’s go. Come with me.

329
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,658
How is it going?

330
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:06,674
Teacher?

331
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,081
I thought it.

332
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:17,491
Dad?

333
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:58,040
He’s already dead.

334
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:38,324
Ton?

335
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:42,437
What you want, Ton?

336
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:43,702
Belle.

337
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:44,757
Danny’s dead.

338
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,505
This is not funny.

339
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:47,808
I’m telling the truth.

340
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,416
He ripped his face off.

341
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:51,300
When did Danny
try to kill himself?

342
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,693
No one help him?

343
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,405
When we seperated
from Rath’s Father,

344
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:00,408
we took to see Mhom.

345
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:01,934
Who Sam told us about.

346
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:03,662
Rut’s Teacher.

347
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:06,145
Story is everywhere
at the moment.

348
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,370
So this mean...

349
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,128
that Medium...

350
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,003
knows everything right?

351
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:14,277
Yes.

352
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:15,302
Why?

353
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,326
That’s it for now.

354
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:21,261
Oh, o-okay.

355
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:23,314
Hmm.

356
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,177
Where is it?

357
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,055
Mhom.

358
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Just a moment.

359
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:07,505
Sam, where's Belle?

360
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,655
She is taking a shower.

361
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:10,392
So...

362
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,395
- You hurry go back to prepare everything.
- Okay.

363
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,446
I'll hurry be there.

364
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,090
- I will take care of Belle.
- Okay.

365
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,875
Hey!

366
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:25,321
Where is this place?

367
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:27,696
Who are you looking for?

368
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,609
I'm looking for my sister.

369
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,129
Close your eyes.

370
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:36,628
Close your eyes, please.

371
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,116
Okay.

372
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,399
Listen to the voice.

373
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:43,548
Belle.

374
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:44,632
Did you hear that?

375
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:46,936
Belle?

376
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,287
Follow that voice.

377
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:52,254
Follow that voice, now.

378
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:53,438
Belle?

379
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:55,538
Belle?

380
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,666
Follow my voice, Belle.

381
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Belle?

382
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:06,648
Belle, can you hear me?

383
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,812
Thank you.

384
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,663
Belle?

385
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,638
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Good, good, good.

386
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:20,959
Okay.

387
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:22,930
Do you know what to do next?

388
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:24,382
Yes.

389
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:26,136
If she wake up, you
know what to do, right?

390
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:27,161
Hit?

391
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:28,186
Yes.

392
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:29,711
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

393
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:31,677
I can't light up the candle.

394
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,702
Oh.

395
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,238
Well, you don't have
to do it anymore.

396
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:38,263
She’s awake.

397
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Let me go!

398
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:42,800
Let me go, you idiot!

399
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:44,050
Let me go, you idiot!

400
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:45,661
Let me go!

401
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:05,243
Belle?

402
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:08,904
Belle, can you hear me?

403
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:14,973
Belle?

404
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,077
Follow my voice, Belle.

405
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,738
Belle, can you hear me?

406
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:30,824
Thank you.

407
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:32,688
Go help Sam.

408
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:39,342
Go screw yourself.

409
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:40,612
Damn!

410
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:43,398
I’ve done nothing to
you! I’m just living my life!

411
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:50,921
Oh, Sam.

412
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,285
I’ve found Belle.

413
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,310
What are you doing!?

414
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:56,943
Damn you!

415
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,297
Oh, shit!

416
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,364
I told you to bring
her to the Pee Tuay Gaew!

417
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,750
What the hell
you’ve been doing!?

418
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:03,721
I said get up!

419
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:13,896
Come here!

420
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:15,997
Let me go!

421
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:17,772
My nose!

422
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:20,162
Leave me alone!

423
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:21,517
Get up!

424
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:52,951
As I’ve heard that

425
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:56,184
you just experienced a mysterious
story about Pee Tuay Gaew.

426
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,355
And Belle, a young woman
who was possessed by a ghost,

427
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,036
pretended to be
her for over 10 years.

428
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,477
Belle is Sam’s older sister.

429
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:04,409
They secretly played Pee Tuay Gaew
when they were kids,

430
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:05,597
and haunted by ghost.

431
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:07,920
Some of their friends killed
themselves because of this.

432
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:11,128
So, I decided to help
Sam, and I figured out that

433
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:12,878
Belle had been possessed by a ghost.

434
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,678
That had stolen her
body since she was a kid.

435
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,581
I had to make them
play Pee Tuay Gaew,

436
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,231
to bring Belle’s soul back again.

437
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,682
That sounds so incredible.

438
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:29,985
Do you have any other
ways to handle this?

439
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,431
Actually, I do have…

440
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,492
Are you okay?

441
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:01,907
What's wrong? I'm almost done.

442
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

443
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,555
Damn it! I’m not even done yet!

444
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,905
Don’t even have your own condoms!

445
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,930
Screw you!

446
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,896
Big night ahead?

447
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,017
You could say that.

448
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:03,132
You planing to stay awake
forever or something?

449
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,828
Something like that.

450
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,157
You know this stuff isn’t, like.

451
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:17,055
Good for you if you overdo it.

452
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,706
Trust me.

453
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:21,843
It’s better than the alternative.

454
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,792
Ma'am, are you okay?

455
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:30,095
Just ring it up, please.

456
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,262
I don’t know what
you’re dealing with but...

457
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:41,049
planning to stay awake
like this, it can be a mess

458
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:42,642
I know.

459
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,043
Oh, Arin.

460
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:47,893
Why did you open it so loud?

461
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:55,881
Arin.

462
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:57,606
Hey!

463
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:00,496
[speaking in foreign language]

464
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:04,638
Are you okay?

465
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:09,753
Why haven’t you answer my calls?

466
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:14,386
I’ve been so worried.

467
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:17,400
Nothing.

468
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:20,297
Lately, I can’t sleep

469
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:29,246
Every time I fall as sleep.

470
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:36,656
It’s like something’s
waiting for me.

471
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:41,857
It’s watching me.

472
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:00,551
Why haven’t you answer my calls?

473
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,953
Deja Vu.

474
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,861
Do you know? I’ve been so worried.

475
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:11,215
The word you said.

476
00:43:14,088 --> 00:43:15,403
You already said it before.

477
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:18,237
Huh?

478
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:20,629
Nevermind.

479
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:22,263
I’ve insomnia lately.

480
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:29,419
Listen to me.

481
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:31,225
I know someone.

482
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:37,626
I think she can help you.

483
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:39,767
Who is she?

484
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:45,729
This suit you so much, Ma’am.

485
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:59,415
[speaks in Thai language]

486
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:05,518
Welcome to Mhom’s world.

487
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,403
Please have your seats.

488
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:10,765
Mhom.

489
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,681
This is my friend.

490
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,558
Her name is Arin.

491
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,368
Long time no see.

492
00:44:19,888 --> 00:44:21,295
By the way, what happened?

493
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,865
Tell me.

494
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:26,722
I can’t sleep.

495
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:33,504
Every times.

496
00:44:34,227 --> 00:44:35,852
Everytime I close my eyes.

497
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,202
There’re something...

498
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:45,745
waiting for me to sleep.

499
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,253
I will tell you something.

500
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:49,919
Belle.

501
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,597
She has a younger
sister, named Sam.

502
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:55,873
Just a year ago.

503
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:01,693
So, what made you come
all the way here today?

504
00:45:02,555 --> 00:45:05,972
I wanna talk to someone
who’s not around anymore.

505
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:06,997
Who?

506
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:08,964
My mother.

507
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:11,967
I’m the one who figure it out.

508
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:17,859
But the last card telling me that
there is something or some spirit...

509
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:19,543
That’s following you.

510
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,627
Do you mean...

511
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:29,627
the ghost following me?

512
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,686
Is the ghost real?

513
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:35,708
Before she has a
normal life like this.

514
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:38,680
She got possessed by the ghost.

515
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,972
She almost died.

516
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:41,758
Do you know?

517
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:43,533
I’m the one who help her.

518
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:44,933
I almost died either.

519
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:50,821
Is that happening to me?

520
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:57,608
Is there a ghost behind me?

521
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:15,385
I don’t know what’s haunting me...

522
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:18,638
but I can feel it.

523
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:25,438
Nothing happens when I'm awake.

524
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,347
But when I fall asleep,

525
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:35,069
I can feel...

526
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:37,129
it is going to kill me.

527
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,266
This is an Pee Tuay Gaew,

528
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,069
that me and Sam used to
play together two years ago.

529
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:55,472
I kept it hidden all along.

530
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:57,345
But...

531
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,370
hoping I’d never
have to touch it again.

532
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,109
But I can’t.

533
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:07,386
It’s the only way
that can help you.

534
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:10,597
And it’s the only way...

535
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:17,438
we can know what
is haunting you.

536
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:25,992
Are you sure we
should play this?

537
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,959
Mhom already warned
us we shouldn’t play.

538
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:31,972
Trust me.

539
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,267
Sometimes,

540
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:38,238
this might be difference.

541
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:41,509
Listen to me.

542
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:45,918
If you and me,

543
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,225
both contact the spirit,

544
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,347
we can figure out what it wants.

545
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:00,641
Before it’s too late.

546
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,316
How do I even play this?

547
00:48:27,123 --> 00:48:28,727
This is Pee Tuey Gaew.

548
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,842
It’s not just a game
that happens recently.

549
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,030
It was a long time ago,

550
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,780
but the important thing
you need to remember.

551
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:42,520
This...

552
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,525
is not just a game.

553
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:54,984
First,

554
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:57,453
you need to lit the candles.

555
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:00,376
It's not just any candles.

556
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:02,386
These candles...

557
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:06,366
needs to be or should
have been blessed.

558
00:49:09,284 --> 00:49:10,284
Next,

559
00:49:10,986 --> 00:49:12,434
you have to lit incenses,

560
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:17,597
and put all the smoke
inside the glass.

561
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,722
You know why?

562
00:49:20,347 --> 00:49:22,640
Because the ghost can move
the glass to communicate.

563
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:23,881
Finally,

564
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:25,773
this Pee Tuay Gaew.

565
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:32,123
It's the only way that
allow them to speak.

566
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:33,378
I don’t want to play.

567
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,540
I’m scared.

568
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:37,602
It’s not just a
game. Be serious.

569
00:49:39,404 --> 00:49:40,899
Are you ready?

570
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,155
If you are ready.

571
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:49,195
Place your finger on
the bottom of this glass.

572
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:58,173
Then,

573
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:01,435
slowly close your eyes.

574
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:04,185
Ask them.

575
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:13,813
Is anyone there?

576
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:47,688
Is anyone there?

577
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:01,760
Is anyone there?

578
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:15,648
What does that mean?

579
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:22,688
Who are you?

580
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,121
What do you want?

581
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:52,453
Who are you?

582
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:55,551
Who are you?

583
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:01,354
Who are you?

584
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:06,054
Are you a ghost or human?

585
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,721
Why are you in my dream?

586
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:09,798
No.

587
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:11,815
You appear in my
dream and always silent.

588
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:13,847
Just tell me who you are?

589
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:14,972
This is not a dream.

590
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,513
This is real.

591
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:19,974
What’s happening?

592
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:22,331
What did you see?

593
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:26,013
I saw.

594
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,870
It’s a boy.

595
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,696
Does she really exist?

596
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:26,049
Play Pee Tuay Gaew again?

597
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,457
Yes.

598
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,844
Thanks for letting me use the space here.

599
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:42,582
Did you find the girl?

600
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:53,080
I can’t remember
who she is anymore.

601
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:01,586
You know?

602
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:04,098
Too much of this stuff can
cause bad effect on you.

603
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:05,845
It can kill you.

604
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:10,629
If I don’t drink it
and fall asleep,

605
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:14,103
I die either.

606
00:54:14,758 --> 00:54:16,539
What the hell are
you talking about?

607
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:22,233
Energy drinks before bed
are a recipe for disaster.

608
00:54:22,548 --> 00:54:23,756
Because these drinks

609
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,701
not only can boost alertness,

610
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:27,301
raise heart rate,

611
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:28,426
raise blood pressure,

612
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,636
but it even affect
your breathing.

613
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:32,229
In the end,

614
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:35,021
those stimulants can mess
with your nervous system.

615
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:38,001
It’s just water.

616
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:39,501
This.

617
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:41,457
Best for your health.

618
00:54:43,108 --> 00:54:44,737
No matter what,

619
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:47,002
your body always
need fresh water.

620
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:50,722
It’s another way that
can keep you awake.

621
00:55:35,649 --> 00:55:37,274
What would you like to order?

622
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:38,299
Why?

623
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,503
You are bartender now.

624
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,712
Aren’t you...

625
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:47,296
a medium or something?

626
00:55:48,489 --> 00:55:49,905
I wear many hats.

627
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:55,832
I called you earlier, made an appointment.

628
00:55:57,793 --> 00:55:58,959
Can we talk right now?

629
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:00,152
Eh?

630
00:56:00,972 --> 00:56:01,972
Not now.

631
00:56:03,222 --> 00:56:04,926
What can I get you?

632
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:08,109
I can’t drink right now.

633
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,910
If I drink I will sleep.

634
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:16,502
Do you have a coffee?

635
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:19,877
Nam?

636
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:23,202
Coffee, what do you think, Nam?

637
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,780
Coffee?

638
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:29,687
Drinking a lot of coffee
can boost too much energy,

639
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,847
can cause high heart rate,

640
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,238
and make you feel restless.

641
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,240
If you have too much coffee.

642
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:41,618
It can make people has
palpitate till they can’t live normally.

643
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:01,036
Thai?

644
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:04,606
Thai?

645
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:08,396
Well, any memories stirring?

646
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:13,305
I’m getting serious.

647
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,633
I... I can’t sleep.

648
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:19,015
Because...

649
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,272
everytime I fall asleep

650
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:25,506
I see...

651
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:27,547
a woman.

652
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,060
Do you know?

653
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,623
If you don’t get
enough of sleep.

654
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,926
It will has a lot of bad effects

655
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:43,583
especially, when
you don’t sleep at all.

656
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,158
I don’t even know.

657
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,680
That girl.

658
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,180
She is a girl or a ghost or...

659
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:00,618
And I don’t even know.

660
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,643
But,

661
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:04,347
I just want to know

662
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:09,553
what do I need to do?

663
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:18,413
Tle.

664
00:58:18,438 --> 00:58:20,501
I know someone who name Tle.

665
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:25,180
Tle been searching for his
brother in spirit world for a year.

666
00:58:26,472 --> 00:58:27,697
And now...

667
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:30,995
you face the same thing
that Tle faced before.

668
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:40,894
What’s wrong?

669
00:58:41,908 --> 00:58:42,908
Nothing.

670
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:52,556
What?

671
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:55,196
No, it’s nothing.

672
00:59:03,616 --> 00:59:04,616
What are you doing?

673
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:20,747
Well...

674
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:22,439
I was sleepwalking.

675
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,551
I was sleepwalking again.

676
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:28,403
Come here.

677
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:30,947
I’ll keep you awake all night.

678
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,543
No, no, no.

679
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:50,904
Not allowed.

680
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,358
What the hell, Tle!

681
00:59:52,557 --> 00:59:53,557
I can’t do it.

682
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:54,645
Tle!

683
01:01:11,387 --> 01:01:12,387
Tle!

684
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:17,231
Come on.

685
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:21,261
Come on.

686
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:31,811
Come to talk with Thai.

687
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,182
[speaking in foreign language]

688
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,501
Mhom says...

689
01:01:57,888 --> 01:01:59,138
you can help me.

690
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:01,722
I have...

691
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:03,097
a problem.

692
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:06,525
Sleep problem.

693
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,844
What sleeping problem do you have?

694
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:11,743
Maybe...

695
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,037
something about...

696
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,565
ghost,

697
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,401
spiritual thing.

698
01:02:19,863 --> 01:02:20,863
Something like that.

699
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But

700
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:25,612
you have to tell me.

701
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:29,097
What will happen to me?

702
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:32,304
How can I prevent it?

703
01:02:32,973 --> 01:02:33,973
You...

704
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:36,322
could you help me?

705
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:40,202
That party...

706
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:43,124
[speaking in foreign language]

707
01:02:44,156 --> 01:02:45,490
A year ago or maybe two.

708
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:47,128
I'm not quite sure about it.

709
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:53,628
My brother and his friends.

710
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:58,122
They played that
fucking Pee Tuey Gaew.

711
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:05,308
What happened after that?

712
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:09,759
After that, I heard that...

713
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:19,057
Rath hit his head on
the table until he died.

714
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:29,597
And there was Danny,
who was Belle's boyfriend.

715
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:30,867
Do you know him?

716
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:35,830
He died while sleeping.

717
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:49,208
And what happen to your brother?

718
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,730
Sleep.

719
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:20,071
I’m sorry for hearing that but

720
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:22,695
I think...

721
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:30,676
I think it has a way
to survive these thing.

722
01:04:32,037 --> 01:04:34,678
But can you bring me to Belle?

723
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,929
Who is Danny’s girlfriend

724
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:51,732
You put a lot of pepper on it.

725
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:53,646
Don’t you feel spicy?

726
01:04:56,968 --> 01:04:58,343
I know it already spicy.

727
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:00,345
But you know?

728
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,370
The way I eat too much spicy,

729
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:06,404
it can raises my
body temperature.

730
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:08,932
When my body
getting high temperature,

731
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:11,370
I can stay awake.

732
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:14,698
Are you crazy?

733
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:17,449
Who told you?

734
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:21,015
Chef told me.

735
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,600
Chef?

736
01:05:23,511 --> 01:05:24,511
There.

737
01:05:27,264 --> 01:05:32,846
Many spicy dishes contain capsaicin.

738
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:35,179
Found in chilli peppers,
gingerols, and ginger.

739
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,180
These can increase
your heart rate,

740
01:05:39,222 --> 01:05:42,133

741
01:05:42,158 --> 01:05:45,023

Side effect.

747
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:02,054
Side effect.

748
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:06,597
I can’t watch you go
through this much longer.

749
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:12,217
We need to get you help.

750
01:06:13,229 --> 01:06:15,646
We’ll find that boy.

[speaking in foreign language]

752
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:25,511
Mhom told me about your sister.

753
01:06:27,602 --> 01:06:28,839
[speaking in foreign language]

754
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:33,763
Could you tell me?

755
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:38,930
My sister?

756
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,368
It started after...

757
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,930
My sister played that stupid Pee Tuay Gaew.

758
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,972
Whatever spirit she called out.

759
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:53,805
From that Pee Tuay
Gaew, it latched onto her.

760
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:56,097
It followed her everywhere.

761
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,972
Everywhere.

762
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:00,917
Why it keeps following?

763
01:07:01,428 --> 01:07:02,803
What does it want?

764
01:07:05,077 --> 01:07:06,098
Her.

765
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:10,089
Us.

766
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,780
What does it want is our soul.

767
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,605
It’s the only way,

768
01:07:23,842 --> 01:07:26,883
that it can bring us to their world.

769
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:33,013
And your sister...

770
01:07:33,013 --> 01:07:34,638
How did it take her?

771
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:51,718
Everyone that slept have to die.

772
01:08:50,948 --> 01:08:52,615
What’s happening to you?

773
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:56,103
Why you can’t sleep?

774
01:09:00,294 --> 01:09:01,294
There's...

775
01:09:02,632 --> 01:09:04,134
There’s something.

776
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:09,732
It has a noisy  sound in my head.

777
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:12,870
That can make me can’t fall asleep.

778
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:19,972
A noisy sound?

779
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,180
Thank you.

780
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:38,151
Thank you so much.

781
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,990
You are on time.

782
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:47,641
Hurry up.

783
01:09:47,885 --> 01:09:49,385
They’re waiting.

784
01:09:56,065 --> 01:09:57,065
Aren’t you coming?

785
01:09:58,188 --> 01:09:59,188
You go ahead

786
01:09:59,426 --> 01:10:00,509
I’ll catch up.

787
01:10:04,154 --> 01:10:05,737
Are you okay?

788
01:10:08,723 --> 01:10:09,931
I’m okay.

789
01:10:12,187 --> 01:10:13,187
Hurry and follow me.

790
01:10:46,931 --> 01:10:47,931
You?

791
01:10:52,138 --> 01:10:53,138
You?

792
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,422
Who are you actually?

793
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:01,110
Who you are actually?

794
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:07,478
What do you want from me?

795
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:11,168
I don’t know.

796
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:18,842
But I think we suppose to meet.

797
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,345
With this Pee Tuay Gaew,

798
01:11:23,764 --> 01:11:26,473
it will bring back
you both memories.

799
01:11:27,473 --> 01:11:29,389
Once you both ready,

800
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:32,848
place your finger on the glass

801
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,014
and ask each other...

802
01:11:35,098 --> 01:11:36,639
Who you really are?

803
01:11:54,374 --> 01:11:55,415
Who are you?

804
01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:00,130
Mhom... what’s going on?

805
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:02,189
After they finish

806
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:03,906
playing that Pee Tuay Gaew,

807
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,631
their memories will return.

808
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:09,376
What are you doing?

809
01:12:10,054 --> 01:12:11,054
Mhom!

810
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:12,867
Mhom!

811
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:13,933
Mhom!

812
01:12:14,757 --> 01:12:15,781
Mhom!

813
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:17,765
Mhom!

814
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:22,915
It’s the only way to
bring my sister back.

815
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,978
Mhom!

816
01:12:24,003 --> 01:12:25,003
Wake up!

817
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:31,678
Mhom!

818
01:12:32,451 --> 01:12:33,456
Mhom!

819
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:34,662
Mhom!

820
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:36,338
Mhom!

821
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:40,712
Mhom!

822
01:12:41,873 --> 01:12:42,873
Wake up!

823
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:46,951
Mhom!

824
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:52,762
Mhom!

825
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:54,883
Wake up.

826
01:12:57,826 --> 01:12:58,946
Mhom!

827
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,707
Why are you here?

828
01:13:09,637 --> 01:13:10,637
What’s going on?

829
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:12,929
You need to go back.

830
01:13:13,754 --> 01:13:15,147
They still need you.

831
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:17,768
I can’t handle it anymore.

832
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:21,169
I don’t know what I should do.

833
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:25,741
Did I do okay?

834
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:28,849
You did okay.

835
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,840
Mhom...

836
01:13:42,973 --> 01:13:44,014
Tle, where’s that bitch?

837
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:45,198
That way.

838
01:13:45,223 --> 01:13:46,223
That bitch has to see me.

839
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:57,392
Bitch, there you are!

840
01:13:57,417 --> 01:13:59,283
Why don’t you mind
your own damn business!?

841
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:01,129
Because you are such a bitch!

842
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:05,051
How dare you?

843
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:06,076
God damn it!

844
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,972
You bitch! How dare you!

845
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,783
You freaking psycho!

846
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:15,214
Damn it!

847
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:16,639
Wait!

848
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:17,639
I'm hurt.

849
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,056
Oh damn! You make
me bleed!? Bitch!

850
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:34,514
Die! You asshole!

851
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:40,049
Did you try to kill me!?

852
01:14:40,074 --> 01:14:41,491
How dare you to hurt me bitch!?

853
01:14:46,075 --> 01:14:47,492
Where are you going? You bitch!

854
01:14:54,435 --> 01:14:55,435
You idiot!

855
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,528
You punch me!

856
01:14:59,688 --> 01:15:00,897
You idiot!!

857
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:38,905
[speaking in foreign language]

858
01:15:40,184 --> 01:15:42,498
[speaking in foreign language]

859
01:16:32,063 --> 01:16:33,554
Why your friends
always bully you?

860
01:16:34,835 --> 01:16:36,014
I have no idea.

861
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:37,889
Maybe because I...

862
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:39,598
I’m different.

863
01:16:40,855 --> 01:16:41,855
Or maybe...

864
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,389
because I can see you.

865
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:48,548
So you're not scared of me?

866
01:16:52,328 --> 01:16:53,578
You...

867
01:16:54,536 --> 01:16:56,036
You’re different.

868
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,139
You're not that scary.

869
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:11,027
So?

870
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,995
How long have you been here?

871
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:14,955
It's been a long time.

872
01:17:16,037 --> 01:17:17,815
Aren't you lonely
when you're alone?

873
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:27,721
This Pee Tuay Gaew.

874
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:31,816
It will connect the world of the
living and the world of the dead.

875
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,681
It will take you
to the spirit world

876
01:17:36,181 --> 01:17:38,098
to connect with the
spirit from the other world.

877
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:39,829
So...

878
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:41,686
What is the spirit world?

879
01:17:42,956 --> 01:17:47,456
The spirit world is the world divided
between the living and the dead.

880
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:50,431
When people die...

881
01:17:50,831 --> 01:17:52,826
their spirit will go to the spirit world.

882
01:17:54,114 --> 01:17:55,406
Then their souls will wander,

883
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:58,483
waiting for the time to be born.

884
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:01,036
The spirits of those
who have recently died

885
01:18:01,061 --> 01:18:02,809
will remain close to
where they passed away.

886
01:18:02,947 --> 01:18:04,502
But I died a long time ago,

887
01:18:05,462 --> 01:18:07,346
so I wander around.

888
01:18:08,556 --> 01:18:11,986
Living people can't go in there.

889
01:18:12,476 --> 01:18:13,552
But I've been there.

890
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:19,407
Because you're different.

891
01:18:42,434 --> 01:18:43,840
What the hell is wrong with you?

892
01:18:43,865 --> 01:18:45,186
What the hell are you doing?

893
01:18:45,612 --> 01:18:47,952
Why did you dress like
this!? I cannot accept this!

894
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,098
You are my son.

895
01:18:49,178 --> 01:18:51,625
Do you have any idea what
they’re talking about you!?

896
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:55,049
Look at me! You stupid!

897
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:57,149
You put the lipstick on you!?

898
01:18:57,174 --> 01:18:59,049
And this damn
clothes too! Take it off!

899
01:18:59,074 --> 01:19:00,083
I cannot bear this!

900
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:02,075
What on Earth is wrong with you?

901
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,410
Why are you like this!?

902
01:19:03,763 --> 01:19:04,780
Lipstick, huh!?

903
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,181
You like it that much, huh!?

904
01:19:06,206 --> 01:19:07,457
You love it!?

905
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:09,816
If you like it that much,
let me do it for you!

906
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:14,064
I’m sick of this
shit! I hate it!

907
01:19:36,942 --> 01:19:38,734
What the hell are you doing?

908
01:19:49,014 --> 01:19:50,430
Don’t you understand?

909
01:19:52,303 --> 01:19:53,970
I did this...

910
01:19:56,514 --> 01:19:57,848
because...

911
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:01,006
I need to bring my sister back.

912
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:07,941
So you use Arin’s
body as sacrifice?

913
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:10,360
Because of your guilt...

914
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,848
Because I killed Sam!

915
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,834
That time...

916
01:20:24,478 --> 01:20:25,478
when we...

917
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,293
played that Pee Tuay Gaew togehter.

918
01:20:30,897 --> 01:20:32,147
I felt like,

919
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,004
there was something...

920
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,254
controlling me.

921
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:42,532
But that time,

922
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,833
I was young.

923
01:20:46,999 --> 01:20:48,499
All I remembered

924
01:20:50,534 --> 01:20:51,534
I picked up...

925
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:55,324
that knife.

926
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:01,639
Then I...

927
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:18,073
I stare...

928
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,390
at my sister who died right in front of me.

929
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,441
You don't have to
feel guilty amymore.

930
01:21:43,742 --> 01:21:44,742
No.

931
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,302
You don't have to
feel guilty amymore.

932
01:21:53,752 --> 01:21:55,460
I told you. You’re not wrong.

933
01:21:56,826 --> 01:21:57,826
I told you.

934
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,156
Don’t feel this way anymore.

935
01:22:00,594 --> 01:22:01,594
Back then.

936
01:22:02,383 --> 01:22:03,383
How old were you?

937
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,545
How would you know
this would happen?

938
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,760
I know.

939
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:11,817
That you carried this
feeling for a long time.

940
01:22:12,192 --> 01:22:15,566
If I can stop the
demon inside of me.

941
01:22:16,931 --> 01:22:17,931
Right now.

942
01:22:18,186 --> 01:22:19,394
My sister would’ve been...

943
01:22:20,162 --> 01:22:21,370
What did I said?

944
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:24,281
You’re not guilty.

945
01:22:25,058 --> 01:22:26,058
Right now.

946
01:22:28,057 --> 01:22:29,557
I have two options.

947
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:32,955
You can stay.

948
01:22:33,276 --> 01:22:34,276
Or you can go...

949
01:22:35,981 --> 01:22:37,307
And if you want to stay

950
01:22:38,031 --> 01:22:39,289
to search for your sister,

951
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:42,348
you have to play
this Pee Tuey Gaew.

952
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,122
For the last time.

953
01:22:50,369 --> 01:22:52,077
And I will let you use this.

954
01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:54,351
My special glass.

955
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:57,807
In order to go find your
sister in the spirit world.

956
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:24,786
Hey! Bitch?

957
01:23:31,077 --> 01:23:32,889
Thai and Arin is
about to finish theirs.

958
01:23:38,134 --> 01:23:39,134
Hey.

959
01:23:43,205 --> 01:23:44,205
Right now.

960
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:46,916
Tle seem...

961
01:23:47,354 --> 01:23:49,141
something on your mind?

962
01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:51,511
Tle, you don’t want to stay...

963
01:23:51,931 --> 01:23:53,056
in this world anymore?

964
01:23:55,591 --> 01:23:57,585
I can’t stay in this world anymore.

965
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:02,276
The reason I kept on staying is...

966
01:24:03,268 --> 01:24:04,704
to search for my brother.

967
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,389
But now that my brother is gone.

968
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,204
Then...

969
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:13,826
there’s no reason to
stay in this world anymore.

970
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:16,985
Tle knew right?

971
01:24:18,982 --> 01:24:21,399
If you leave this body behind.

972
01:24:22,527 --> 01:24:23,844
You can never return.

973
01:24:25,431 --> 01:24:26,764
I think it’s the best.

974
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:10,470
I know who you are.

975
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:21,946
I know who you are.

976
01:25:24,623 --> 01:25:25,623
I already know.

977
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,901
I know who you are.

978
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:56,965
I know.

979
01:25:57,117 --> 01:25:58,541
I know who you are.

980
01:25:59,632 --> 01:26:01,678
I know who you are.

981
01:26:21,117 --> 01:26:22,492
I know who you are.

982
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:29,378
I know who you are.

983
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:15,545
I know who you are.

984
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,340
Pee Tuay Gaew,

985
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:24,724
it’s just a tool.

986
01:27:26,173 --> 01:27:28,389
Some people use it for
helping someone they love.

987
01:27:30,014 --> 01:27:32,306
Some people use it
for fixing their mistakes.

988
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:35,389
Some people use it for finding answers.

989
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:40,067
The answer that might
connect to their past.

990
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:42,389
But don’t forget,

991
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,217
Pee Tuay Gaew is just the beginning.

992
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,243
But after that,

993
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:50,681
it is a reality that must be faced.

994
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:54,038
Even if in the
end there is death.

995
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:31,098
Hello.

996
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,764
Today we are with the famous
seer that everyone want to see.

997
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:38,098
- Mhom, hello.
- Hello.

998
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:43,098
Actually, a lot of people
knows her well already.

999
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:46,098
But can you introduce yourself?

1000
01:28:46,899 --> 01:28:49,162
Hi, my name is Mhom.

1001
01:28:51,223 --> 01:28:54,223
I heard the rumor that you have
a sense which can see ghost.

1002
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:55,973
You can contact with the spirit?

1003
01:28:56,473 --> 01:28:57,473
Yes, I can.

1004
01:28:58,181 --> 01:29:00,014
And what about horoscope?

1005
01:29:00,139 --> 01:29:03,139
What are your method
in being prophet?

1006
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:05,306
Can you describe it to us?

1007
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:09,281
Of course.

1008
01:29:09,306 --> 01:29:13,139
My horoscope uses tarot cards as a medium.

1009
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:16,264
And uses my sense to contact
with spirit and do prophecy.

1010
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,514
The main one is my six sense.

1011
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:20,889
Because I have sense since I was young.

1012
01:29:20,914 --> 01:29:22,394
Horoscope.

1013
01:29:22,419 --> 01:29:23,419
Contact with the spirit.

1014
01:29:23,444 --> 01:29:27,652
If you interest, you can contact
me via all channels below.

1015
01:29:27,677 --> 01:29:28,969
Is it okay?

1016
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:30,514
Oh, okay.

1017
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:51,598
[chanting]

1018
01:29:58,251 --> 01:29:59,376
Is it finished, sir?

1019
01:30:00,056 --> 01:30:01,264
Yes.

1020
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:05,306
Is it going to work?

1021
01:30:06,059 --> 01:30:07,351
Absolutely 100 percent.

1022
01:30:08,868 --> 01:30:12,577
Good things will come
into your life for sure.

1023
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:15,747
But you have to wait for it.

1024
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:19,605
Yes, sir.

1025
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:38,389
The cost of the
ceremony is 9,999 baht.

1026
01:30:38,526 --> 01:30:42,419
How would you like to
pay? By cash or QR scan?

1027
01:30:49,181 --> 01:30:50,323
Can I use promtpay?

1028
01:30:50,348 --> 01:30:51,681
Of course.
