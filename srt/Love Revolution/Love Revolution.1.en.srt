Pajama Party Guest Hostel

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,690
- Gong Joo Yeong, catch.
- Yes.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,390
- More coming.
- Hey, Hey.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,010
Are you not being careful just because it's not yours?

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,630
Gong Joo Yeong (17/ High school student) Moving Today

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,490
Just order some delivery food now.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,300
Time attack mode on!
Lee Gyeong Woo (17/High School Student) Gong Joo Yeong's friend

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,920
Please stop.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,120
Construction robot preparation complete.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,160
Kim Byeong Hoon (17/High School Student)

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,820
- Next person, catch!
- Hey!

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,280
Jeez.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,330
There's just the three of us.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,100
Anyway, if anything is broken, one of you is the culprit.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,390
Bull*. It's just clothing.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,860
Hey, this is my favorite outfit. If you're going to do that, go home.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,280
What? Actually, we could totally be treated to jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk in exchange for our work today. (Black been noodles and sweet-sour pork, eaten when you move.)

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,320
Are you kidding?

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,540
- Tang-tansgsuyuk?

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,870
Yes.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,910
The cost-benefit ratio is dirty.

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,080
Hey. I am taking my first step toward independence by moving out of the nest.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,360
But you kids are just looking for food.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,500
Your parents pay your rent and living expenses. What kind of independence is that?

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,600
It's more like life is sweet for you.

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,770
Gong Joo Yeong

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,470
What is this? Did I draw this?

28
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,490
Yes. I'm almost there. I'm on the bus now.

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,050
This stop is Ilsam-dong. Ilsam-dong.

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,660
What is this? Why does it look like her?

32
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,600
princess_0 (Translation of his name)

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,590
Love Revolution: Every first meeting is mostly fate.
kyungwoo @princess_0: "Actually, no."

34
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,620
💝 Episode 1 #Moving #First meeting #Fate

35
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,690
- What are you doing?
- Joo Yeong is sleeping.

36
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,690
Wow, you delinquent. It's 8:30 now.

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,890
You're late on the first day of school.

38
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,510
Mom! Why didn't you wake me—

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,720
...up?

40
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,320
- Gyeong Woo, wait!
- Come quickly.

41
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,990
Wait a minute.

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,380
Gyeong Woo, I need bus fare.

43
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,900
Here.

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,970
Balance is insufficient.

45
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,170
Balance is insufficient.

46
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,440
Not enough?

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,890
Student, don't you have cash?

48
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,200
Ahjussi, can't you just let me ride today? Tomorrow I'll pay double.

49
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,990
How would I know that?

50
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,690
I will definitely ride your bus tomorrow, please?

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,170
It's my day off. Get off.

52
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,020
There are people waiting.

53
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,470
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,570
For two people. Him too.

55
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,450
Multiple fares.

56
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,570
Thank you.

57
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,410
Sir.

58
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,930
Kyeong Woo. Isn't she beautiful?

59
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,390
Who?

60
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,860
Her.

61
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,590
So?

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,460
When we were moving yesterday, I saw her too.

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,970
I think she and I have some kind of connection.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,220
- No ... I should grab onto something...
- Got you.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,910
I got you.

66
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm so embarrassed.

68
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,650
Welcome to Yisam Information High School

69
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,240
There are surely some of you who chose Yeesam Information High School because you don't like studying.

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,400
Now that you are in my class, put aside any of those illusions you have in advance.

71
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,070
Dokgo Moon (45/single)
Joo Yeong's homeroom teacher/school principal

72
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,150
Kim Baeng: Heol, I think our homeroom teacher is really harsh.

73
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,350
I heard he's like the dean of students. Shiver.

74
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,340
To Kyeong Woo's classroom during break time? Go Go?

75
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,860
Gong Joo: Go Go

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,340
There's no shortening of class because it's the first day of school so do your best.

77
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,880
I hope you won't do anything to wear me out on the first day of class.

78
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,770
Jo Yeon Sa (38/single)
Ja Rim's Homeroom teacher

79
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,170
He's sleeping?

80
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,340
Forget it. End of assembly.

81
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,840
It smells like rotten danmuji (picked raddish)! You didn't brush your teeth yesterday, did you?

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,120
I collected it all night for you.

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,930
Why are you stinking up some one else's class, you ass?

84
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,390
An Gyeong Min (17/High school student)
Alone since birth.

85
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,700
Are you still middle schoolers?

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,940
Went to middle school together.

87
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,700
Again? Again? Hurry, hurry.

88
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,460
- How was it?
- Ah, it's hot.

89
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,420
It feels worse because it was hot.

90
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,630
Wang Ja Rim (17/High school student)
Was grabbed by the collar

91
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,530
Crazy punk.

92
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,970
Yang Min Ji (17/High School student)
Was hit by the burp

93
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,510
Oh Ah Ram (17/high school student)
Blackbelt holder

94
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,770
You grabbed her by the collar?

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,290
- From the first day, you've done something legendary.
- I said it was an accident!

96
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,070
Would Wang Ja Rim agree? It probably looked like you were asking to fight her.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
- Wang Ja Rim? Is her name Wang Ja Rim?
- That's what I heard.

98
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,480
Why didn't you tell me in advance that she's in your class?

99
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,050
I was sleeping.

100
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,570
Because of you, the goddess looked at me with contempt.

101
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,710
Hey. But isn't it total destiny?

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,600
Seeing her two days in a row, being in the same school and in the same grade.

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,100
On top of that, she paid for my bus fare, and I even grabbed her by the collar.

104
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,270
Does grabbing someone by their collar also count as fate?

105
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,060
So are you going to confess with a knee kick?

106
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,730
Hey, listen. Romance is supposed to start naturally when a man and woman meet by accident.

107
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,460
I heard her name is Wang Ja ("Prince") Rim and mine is Gong Joo ("Princess") Yeong. A prince and princess.

108
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,580
Isn't that perfect fate?

109
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,660
My romance manhwa (comic book) has already begun!

110
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Shut your mouth! Fate, what a joke. How can you fall in love when you only brushed past her?

111
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,920
I really want to goose you with a shigan.
(aka Finger Pistol, combat technique from the manga, One Piece.)

112
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,940
But we're fated for each other!

113
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,580
Thanks to you I finished unpacking quickly. Thank you.

114
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,760
Stop by my house. My mom said she would make you some side dishes because you're living alone.

115
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,940
Really? I like jangjorim (Beef boiled in soy sauce).

116
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,740
Jangjorim is my destiny.

117
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,720
Shut up and just accept whatever you're given.

118
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Yes.

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,870
What?

120
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,360
She must live in that apartment house.

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,480
Look, my house is there, and she lives here.

122
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,910
Total goosebumps. With this, you still say we weren't meant to be?
Red: Joo Yeong's studio - Blue: Kyeong Woo's house - Black: Wang Ja Rim's apartment.

123
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,430
Hey, my house is closer that way.

124
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,500
On top of that, I'm in her class.

125
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Fine. Then, if we meet again tomorrow at 8:30, it really will be fate.

126
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,630
Look. Indeed, we are meeting her. I knew we were meant to be.

127
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,180
Weirdo. You've been waiting for 20 minutes.

128
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,140
You almost made me tardy.

129
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Then later at the snack bar if she buys the same drink, it's fate.

130
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,250
I knew it was fate. Bananas are white;

131
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,840
polar bears are white, and polar bears like coke!

132
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,470
Do you want to get hit by a polar bear?

133
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,830
What! When did you get here?

134
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,090
Banan

135
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,750
You don't have to know.

136
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,710
If Wang Ja Rim comes out wearing a skirt, it's destiny.

137
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,200
Just say if she is breathing, it's destiny.

138
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,590
Hey, how could you rip your skirt already?

139
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,670
Exactly. Isn't that some sort of sign?

140
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,030
Your school life is destined to be eventful.

141
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,190
What are you talking about? I don't believe stuff like that.

142
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,120
You're here. Let's go to the internet cafe.

143
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,510
Hey. Isn't that enough for you to be dating Byeong Hoon? It's destiny.

144
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,640
- Why are you doing this to me?
- What have I done?

145
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm going Mid. Someone come here.

146
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,480
Got it.

147
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,660
As you said, I guess it's not destiny.

148
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,860
- Should I give up?
- Stop whining and focus.

149
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,600
- Hey Lee Kaeng, come in and gank, gank! Now!
- Push the line.

150
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,030
You are being slaughtered.

151
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,940
You were too late.

152
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,160
- Goodness...
- Let's just surrender.

153
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,660
If my level goes down because of you, what are you going to do?

154
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,760
- Life is more important than games.
- Lee Kaeng, Gong Joo!

155
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,890
A moment ago I told you to enter and gank.

156
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,980
I need to drink some cola, this is frustrating.

157
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Hyung, a coke please.

158
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,500
Order it.

159
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,590
Hey, Hyung. Of course, the coke is on the house, right?

160
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,950
You crazy bastard.

161
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,810
You were simply too scared to take action, so you waited, calling it fate or whatever.

162
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,570
If you really had feelings for her, you should have approached her.

163
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,100
How should I do that though?

164
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,420
I totally ruined my first impression. I don't even have anything to talk to her about.

165
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,010
The bus fare.

166
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,110
Didn't you borrow the bus fare from her?

167
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,120
You've got to pay her back.

168
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,050
Right, there was that. I should get going right this instant!

169
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,780
Do you even know her apartment number?

170
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,300
Can't you just get close to her quickly and help me out?

171
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,490
Why don't you ask me to date her in your place as well, while you're at it?

172
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,710
This dating dummy.

173
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,000
What is that supposed to mean?

174
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
With a face like this, I basically have a Ph.D. in dating.

175
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Move it before I smash your head in. Let's just start with the basics.

176
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,770
- Just try and talk to her properly.
- Piece of cake.

177
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,820
I thought it was a piece of cake?

178
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,470
It's awkward because you're always by my side.

179
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,110
Tomorrow, you go first.

180
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,520
- Yes, yes.
- From tomorrow.

181
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,110
Day 1

182
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,350
She's coming. She's coming!

183
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,510
Day 2

184
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,190
Excuse me?

185
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,760
Day 3

186
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,320
Gosh.

187
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,870
Hey! Do you want me to set you up with a guy?

188
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,150
- No!
- You don’t have to answer this fast.

189
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,980
- Won't you see who he is, at least?
- I'm not looking.

190
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,370
- Can you arrange a date for me, then?
- You can't.

191
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,950
- Why not?
- Why would I risk him hating me by introducing you?

192
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,360
You're an asshole! By chance, do you like m—

193
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,460
- Are you crazy? Look at you in the mirror, you'll see why.
- Gosh!

194
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:10,170
Hey. That aside, I think someone's been stalking me these days.

195
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,380
What? Really?

196
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,900
Since a few days, every morning the same guy follows me.

197
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,990
- Did you see his face?
- Not really,

198
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,260
but he has a bowl cut and wore a red sweatshirt, today.

199
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,430
His height is average.

200
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,340
- What?
- Hey! Wang Ja Rim just told me that she's being stalked every morning.

201
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,320
What?! What kind of pervert would do something like this?

202
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,600
But wait, I follow her every morning and I’ve never seen anyone stalking her.

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,820
You're stupid! She's talking about you! She even knows what you look like and how you’re dressed.

204
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,140
A bowl cut and a red sweatshirt.

205
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,090
- What are you doing?
- Ah! Ahn Kyeong Min.

206
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,390
Wait a second.

207
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,930
What are you doing?

208
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,720
- What? Are you giving this to me?
- Yes! My God! It looks better on you.

209
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,210
What are you doing?

210
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,580
All right. Perfect!

211
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,890
Yeah, it would be perfect if I hadn’t been here.

212
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,740
This is the stalker Ja Rim told us about, right? Kyeong Woo, what this is all about?

213
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,310
No! I've been following her, but I'm not a stalker!

214
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,250
What nice and fresh bullshit. That's what a stalker is.

215
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,140
I have my reasons.

216
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,640
I want to pay her my bus fare, but it's hard for me to talk to her.

217
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
You like Ja Rim, don't you?

218
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,800
What? No!

219
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,950
What are you doing?

220
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,990
You can't! I recommend you give up quickly!

221
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,770
- Why?!
- That scared me!

222
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,070
So you do like her!

223
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,020
But it's a pity. Ja Rim totally dislikes boys like you.

224
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,330
Then, what's her style?

225
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,110
I don't know. She's never dated anyone before.

226
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,410
She's never dated anyone before?

227
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,040
Wow, unbelievable. She's so pretty...

228
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,470
Wait a minute. What the heck?

229
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,690
Then you wouldn't know whether I'm her style or not.

230
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,730
I know that at the very least, she doesn't like people who are as forward as you.

231
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,510
Instead of getting hurt, just quit. I'll be going now.

232
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,020
Who does she think she is?

233
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,950
Who do you think you are?

234
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,310
Did you try to make me a stalker just now?

235
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,920
I mean... about that... Yes.

236
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,690
So disappointing.

237
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,870
Hey!

238
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,930
You need to give back my jacket.

239
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,140
- Hey, wait!
- Hey.

240
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,780
Forget it.

241
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,860
Just pay her back by tomorrow.

242
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,170
- The longer you drag it out, the more difficult it'll get.
- Okay.

243
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,970
Okay. Today I will surely!

244
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,960
Where are you going? Who are you? Why do you keep following me?

245
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,530
Huh? Oh... T-To pay you back.

246
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,000
- Pay me back?
- You paid for my bus fare.

247
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,820
I accidentally grabbed you by the collar that day.

248
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,150
Yeah, that's me.

249
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,210
You don't have to pay it back. It's only 1000 won (~$0.85).

250
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,470
No, I have to pay you back!

251
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,790
Then pay me back.

252
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,180
Here.

253
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,850
Why the envelope? The envelope looks more expensive than the fare.

254
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,250
Um... I'm Gong Joo Yeong. What's your name?

255
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,830
Wang Ja Rim.

256
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,540
Your name is pretty.

257
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,700
I live in a studio just over there. Let's be friends.

258
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,840
Sure.

259
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,640
5 Days Ago

260
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,300
The most fabulous day of my life has been decided, and it won't ever change.

261
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,800
That's the day that I first met you.

262
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,200
My eyes were made to see you, my hands were made to give you this letter,

263
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,930
and my heart was made to flutter for you. I'm sure of it.

264
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,650
We don't know each other well yet, but that's not the case for our names.

265
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,300
Wang Ja Rim, Gong Joo Yeong. These two words, prince and princess, are always paired together.

266
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,150
If it's for you, I will happily become a princess.

267
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,620
To my handsome prince.

268
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,950
Please accept the feelings of your princess...

269
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,800
Love Revolution

270
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,560
Love is all about timing.

271
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,060
Can you tell me your phone number?

272
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,180
- Well, right now is not the time.
- Why?

273
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,350
What in the world is this?

274
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,130
Don't people usually give up at this point?

275
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,560
Except for him...

276
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,120
I do think he's a bit special.

277
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,580
Wang Ja Rim didn't bring an umbrella.

278
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,510
Why would I use your umbrella, you crazy buffoon?

279
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,730
Isn't this Ja Rim's? Doesn't she need her keys?

280
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,150
Hey!

281
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,310
I picked it up on the way here.

282
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,010
Wang Ja (prince) and Gong Joo (princess). Even their names are a perfect match!

283
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,400
Starting from their names, they're a match made in heaven!
