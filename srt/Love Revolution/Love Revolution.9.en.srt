1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,900
The weather is wonderful. The sky too is pretty.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,750
But these days, no matter how beautiful things are, they're just so-so to me.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,170
Is it because my standard for beauty has gotten too high?

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,550
If you compare anything to my Ja Rim, it is insignifi—

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,750
Shut your trap!

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,570
Did it get broken? Why do the words in your head keep leaking out?

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,470
So cringe-y.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,530
But I keep thinking of you.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,570
I have to at least do this to empty my head.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,590
Ja Rim, when do you think of me?

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,410
When I get a text from you.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,470
- Then I should text you once a minute.
- Yeah. You'll get blocked.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,860
Actually, I too think of you just once a day.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,740
From the time I wake up until I fall asleep, exactly once.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,860
Sorry. I'll stop.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,410
It was far from a done deal, but somehow they're still dating.

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,030
But it's more like having a pet than a dating relationship.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,820
At least when you have a pet, you nurture it. This is just a master-servant relationship.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,550
Do you think this snack will really be able to enter your mouth?

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,890
Let me go, let me go. Hurry and let me go.

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,900
Ah, ah, you're too much.

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,220
Are you crazy, seriously!

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,540
If you have something to say, say it.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,700
- Are you busy this weekend?
- Yeah. I am. I have to go clothes shopping.

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
There, it's done. Thanks.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,790
You can go now.

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,760
Gong Joo Yeong. Have you still not managed to take Ja Rim on a date?

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,000
- Yeah. Because Ja Rim seems to not want to. What if we break up again because I keep pushing?

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,970
Gosh, I do feel bad for you, but you two are really something in your own separate ways.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,030
Totally frustrating.

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,610
Hey! Extra! Extra!

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,660
Look at this.

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,170
Ilsam-dong cafe with a nice ambiance. A place where handsome guys work

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,660
Shall we go together this weekend?

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,320
Not fond of that idea.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,200
- Oh why? I need you to bring Ja Rim.
- What? You want me to help again?

37
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,950
Please. When you date I will support you totally.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,790
- What's up?
- What?

39
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh? About what?

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm asking what are you doing?

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,320
You want to surprise Kyeong Woo?

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,930
Okay. I get it. Over.

43
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,690
I mean, you guys can just tell me you're throwing me a birthday party. Why make up an excuse?

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,050
Surprise party

45
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,500

Love Revolution: Surprise Party
Episode 9 #Today'sWork # Strange #Customers #NoThanks

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,300
Min_jji @Kyungwoo: Please call the boss.

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,990
- I'm here.
- What? You're early.

49
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,320
- I had some free time. I'll change.
- Okay.

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,980
Hey, you need to wear a bowtie.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,310
If I button up the shirt tightly, my neck will bruise. The customers wouldn't like to see that.

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,640
Jeez.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,100
- There's a call from room 2 so go there first.
- Yes.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,040
Is there anything I can...

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,390
- Hey!
- Hi!

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,780
- What's with you, guys? How did you know I work here?
- Look at you.

57
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,120
We are guests. Why aren't you speaking politely?

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
I think we should call the boss.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,760
Boss!

60
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,030
Is that a birthday punch?

61
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,520
I heard the concept here was handsome guys,

62
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,220
but there's no handsome guy and the service is so poor.

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,170
Aren't you going to order? If you're going to fool around, please beat it, dear customers.

64
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,330
We'll order, though.

65
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,760
I will get rosé pasta.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,930
Please use hand-made noodles and keep them separate from the sauce. I like to dip.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,060
For the cream in cream pasta, is it whipping cream?

68
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,030
Yes.

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,370
You are cruel. Please give me cream that's already dead.

70
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,570
For me, give me water as clear as Italy's Lake Como in which you put ice colder than an Icelandic glacier,

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,090
into a minimalist cup of Swedish sensitivity.

72
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,800
I want to admire the dew that forms like jewels on the smooth surface of the cup.

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,620
- Iced water?
- Yes.

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,440
These punks. So you're throwing me a surprise party?

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Okay, okay. I'll play along with you for now.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,350
Do you bring the Hawaiian pizza directly from Hawaii?

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,130
You can leave for Hawaii, then.
(T/N: famous line from the 2001 movie "Friend")

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,450
Boss, could you make some seafood-ri zotto for me?

79
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,990
It's seafood risotto.

80
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,490
Yes. With a lot of zotto, please.

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,640
Guests. Could you just order what's written in the menu?

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,760
We'll let you know once we've decided. Just go for now.

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,430
How boring.

84
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,650
Why do you want to have fun at someone's workplace? Is this what you called me for?

85
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,180
No, well, we thought it would be fun.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Then you guys should play. I'm leaving first. I was going shopping for clothes anyway.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,230
Okay. Leave Super Serious out.

88
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,260
Hey! Don't speak carelessly about my girlfriend.

89
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,630
- All right. I'll sit next to Min Ji then.
- Bye.

90
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,020
Yeah. You guys are going to buy me a cake.

91
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,220
I'll wait for you.

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,500
Are they all acting gods?

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,850
Ja Rim, wait for me.

94
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,730
What are you coming along for? I'm more comfortable shopping alone.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll just be with you. I won't bother you and be like the invisible man.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,160
If you need, I can carry your stuff.

97
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,520
Okay, follow me.

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,780
You would come even if I told you not to, anyway.

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,700
How do you know me so well? Are you thinking about me?

100
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
It's room 2.

101
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,990
What?

102
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,870
Some water please.

103
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,510
What?

104
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,580
Some tissue please.

105
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,600
What is it?

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,120
The air conditioner is too cold. Please hug me.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,100
Warmly.

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,310
Order everything at once, dammit.

109
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,230
The joke is going a bit far.

110
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,930
Kyeong Woo.

111
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,850
- Please tell your friends to stop playing around with the bell.
- Yes.

112
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,190
And there are other customers around, so speak politely to them.

113
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,540
Why did you call for me again, dear customers?

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,370
I pressed the bell by mistake. Sorry!

115
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,090
Too funny!

116
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,640
- How was it?
- You did well.

117
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,150
Excuse me.

118
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,090
Yes. Do you need anything?

119
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,280
Your phone number, please.

120
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,920
- Mine?
- Yes.

121
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,510
Don't tell me they really forgot my birthday?

122
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,180
Do people like this kind of stuff?

123
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,530
This is filled with eternal love for you, my dear. Love you.

124
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,000
Of course, I love it!

125
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,680
Guys! Thank you so much.

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,960
I really thought you guys forgot about my birthday.

127
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,850
Of course not! That's impossible! We're so close!

128
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,430
How can we forget your birthday?

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,630
Did you prepare this?

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,840
Of course. We're all gathered here for Byeong Hoon, right?

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,990
Right. That's right.

132
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,860
But, did you prepare this yourself?

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, I just brought it in.

134
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,130
Happy Birthday!

135
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,740
Happy Birthday! Congrats!

136
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,390
Ja Rim. I think this will look good on you.

137
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,940
I said I'll choose myself.

138
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,620
Ja Rim. One is for me, right?

139
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,060
No. Both of them are mine.

140
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,350
I'll buy these, please.

141
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,610
No. I'll pay...

142
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,510
By chance, did you get those on purpose?

143
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,720
You're so mean.

144
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,320
Do you want to hang out with me that much?

145
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,250
Of course. Hanging out with you is my life-long dream.

146
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,650
Okay then. What do you want to do?

147
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,820
Happy birthday to you!

148
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,950
Happy birthday to you!

149
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,390
Happy birthday to our dear Byeong Hoon!

150
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,390
Happy birthday to you!

151
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,790
- And the candles?
- Don't we have candles?

152
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,700
- No candles?
- No candles?

153
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,660
No candles?

154
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,150
If there's none, let's just eat it.

155
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,230
- Let's eat!
- Looks so tasty!

156
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,740
Take this one at least.

157
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,160
- Are you Gong Joo Yeong?
- What the?

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,280
You're Wang Ja Rim, Wang Ja Rim.

159
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,500
Let's eat, let's eat!

160
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,730
Hey, these strawberries are super sweet. Eat some, hurry up.

161
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,490
- A valley?
- Yes.

162
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,180
Last year, us guys went to Byeong Hoon's grandpa's house.

163
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,890
He told us to come this year as well. He said the more friends we bring, the better.

164
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,800
- Forget it. I'm not going.
- Come on.

165
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
If you don't, you'll regret it so much. The water there is so clear and refreshing.

166
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,710
Plus, you don't have to pay anything, and they even prepare food for us.

167
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,150
Also, you can see that there are plenty of stars in the night sky.

168
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,690
You can also see the Milky Way there.

169
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,260
You like dogs, right? There is even a really cute dog there.

170
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,960
What do you think?

171
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,110
I'll think about it.

172
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,750
Okay! Then, you're going.

173
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,690
I told you I'd think about it. Just decide where do you want to go now.

174
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,700
I've already decided where I want to go with you.

175
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,750
Don't hold my hand.

176
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Why are you calling for me again?

177
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,830
Kyeong Woo. Come here and eat some cake.

178
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Hey.

179
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,550
By any chance, this cake is...

180
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,590
Yes. Thank you.

181
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,360
You worked hard to secretly prepare for my birthday.

182
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,860
You crazy morons! Why would you eat it?

183
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,600
You didn't prepare this for my birthday party? I just brought it in, that's all.

184
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,150
Didn't you prepare it yourself?

185
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,350
It was left here by a customer for a surprise event.

186
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,460
What are we going to do now?

187
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,550
Right. Then that means no one knew about my birthday in the end.

188
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,750
But still, you had a birthday party.

189
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,670
I'm sorry about that, but what are you going to do about this?

190
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,600
What do you think? It's not going to fix itself while we whine about it.

191
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,320
What time is the event?

192
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,540
There is less than an hour left.

193
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,530
We have to keep these on?

194
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:20,710
Yes. The concept of the room you chose is where you have to escape while being handcuffed together.

195
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,230
- Hey. You chose this place on purpose, right?
- What?

196
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,710
No. I didn't know it was like this either.

197
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,110
But still... It seems fun, right?

198
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,850
Can't we just do it without handcuffs?

199
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,640
Ja Rim, let's give it a try.

200
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,770
It's not even holding hands anyway. Can't we just do it?

201
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,070
Okay.

202
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,310
- ka-talk
- ka-talk

203
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,390
- The guys tell me to come back.
- I also got a message.

204
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,400
They say it's super urgent, and to bring you back no matter what.

205
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,180
But, this is our date.

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,390
Hey...

207
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,350
What happened?

208
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,510
Can't you see? It's a complete mess.

209
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,430
We looked through a few places...

210
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,170
But there was only this left.

211
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,830
It's too different.

212
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,050
- What should we do?
- Lee Kaeng.

213
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,450
- Maybe it'll be okay if you use your capitalist smile a bit.
- Dammit.

214
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,820
Can you joke in this situation?

215
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,600
There isn't even much time left.

216
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,550
- Kyeong Woo. There are various types of whipping cream in the kitchen, right?
- Yes.

217
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,250
Okay.

218
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,710
Then, for the roses... Byeong Hoon and Kyeong Min, you guys are experts at rose paper folding now, right?

219
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,470
- Well, I could do it with my eyes closed now.
- Yeah...

220
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,190
Okay. Then, who is good at handwriting?

221
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,000
- Kyeong Woo, strawberry powder please.
- Okay.

222
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,250
Min Ji, ice.

223
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,150
Yes, Sir.

224
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,180
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

225
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,490
Ja Rim, the strawberries please.

226
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,600
- Here.
- Thanks.

227
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,570
It looks pretty similar.

228
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,980
Wow.
Dear...

229
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,210
What do you think of this big bro's skills?

230
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,200
Not bad.

231
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
When you come in,

232
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,950
please play a moist— no I mean, a sweet love song.

233
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,700
And please say "The eternal love you have ordered is here,"

234
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Can't believe there are other people besides Gong Joo Yeong who do this kind of stuff.

235
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,330
Who on earth is he?

236
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,290
Here is the eternal...

237
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,740
♫ Cause you are my girl  ♫

238
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,090
♫ You are the one that I envisioned in my dream ♫
(T/N: popular sitcom "High Kick Through the Roof" OST)

239
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:51,580
♫ And when you're around, I can't express— ♫

240
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,170
The eternal love you have ordered...

241
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,880
is here.

242
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,700
Yes.

243
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,030
This is filled with eternal love for you, my dear. Love you.

244
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,660
So, you working part-time

245
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,990
to help out in the cafe is really commendable.

246
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,230
Yes. Thank you.

247
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,260
About what you saw today... Forget it all.

248
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,300
I also... want to forget about it.

249
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,600
Right. Okay.

250
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,010
I'll go to the bathroom.

251
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,570
It's coming, it's coming.

252
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,320
♪ Real, real, real, real, it's real. It's totally real. ♪

253
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,350
♪ The real thing appeared now ♪

254
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,790

256
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,250
Mister, one more hour for this room, please!

257
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,980
From what I saw earlier, you're good with your hands.

258
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,690
I always have been, that's true.

259
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,490
I probably take after my father. He's a chef.

260
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,160
Oh, really? Are you good at cooking too?

261
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah. Look forward to your birthday. I'll make you something so good you'll cry.

262
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
You can have great expectations. Okay?

263
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,540
Not okay. If you do that, you're dead.

264
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,230
Then, go in safely.

265
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,790
No. I'll walk you all the way home.

266
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,060
Forget it. It's right in front anyway. Just go in.

267
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,090
Since it's right in front of us, I'll walk you there.

268
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,650
- You're really being stubborn.
- Come on.

269
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,500
I would have already brought you home by the time you say this.

270
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,560
Do whatever you want.

271
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,860
♫ I like you ♫

272
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,540

275
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,120
Couple outfits!

276
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,310
It's such a coincidence! Right?

277
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,180
Who are you?

278
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,760
Hi.

279
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,610
- I'm here.
- Byeong Hoon!

280
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,550
My cute puppy!

281
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,220
What do you think about getting married to Byeong Hoon?

282
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,290
Put on some ointment.

283
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,550
Hey, did you call us here to work?

284
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,130
Anyone have water?

285
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,820
Out of the way.

286
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,700
What's wrong with you?

287
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,550
Hey, Wang Ja Rim. Don't live like that.

288
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,800
Hey, where is this punk?

289
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,890
Joo Yeong! Joo Yeong!

290
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,890
What are you doing?

291
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,010
