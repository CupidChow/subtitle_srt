00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,400
Episode 16

2
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,750
Congratulations.

3
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,650
For?

4
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,800
Congratulations, you're no longer the Crown Prince Lee Shin trapped living in the palace.

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,380
But you are now a real person
who can feel the fresh air.

6
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,300
Where is this place?

7
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,580
-Summer palace.
-Summer palace?

8
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,410
It's a place where the Royals get
away from the heat during the summer.

9
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,650
It does look interesting.

10
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,100
Jeonha.

11
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,320
I really didn't think that you'll come.

12
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,200
I wasn't informed either,
what brings you here?

13
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,700
Are you doing well?

14
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes. Jeonha.

15
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,080
Aren't you the Bingung Mama?

16
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,300
I pay my respects to you now.

17
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,960
How do you do, grandfather?

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,160
I want to have an overnight stay, is it okay?

19
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,100
Of course, Jeonha.

20
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,750
Then, I shall go prepare everything first.

21
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,550
Hey!

22
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,550
What?

23
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,830
Are you not hungry?

24
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,940
Let's eat rice!

25
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,840
Rice?

26
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,220
When you came to my house
didn't I cook ramen for you?

27
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,450
You told me that you are a boy scout?
Then you should know how to cook rice.

28
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,700
Yes. I know how to cook rice.

29
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,100
Let's eat rice now, hurry!
I am hungry.

30
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,700
Okay, let's eat rice, but before that, look!

31
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,450
The scenery is so beautiful.

32
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,490
I can only see rice.

33
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,110
Let's eat rice!

34
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,700
Let's eat~

35
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,270
Why would you buy this??

36
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,390
Radish?

37
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,810
Onions are good for health.

38
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,550
-Put it back!
-Yes.

39
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,750
Look at this.

40
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,240
Wait a moment.

41
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,550
This.

42
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,390
Yeah, that's right!

43
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,340
We need to buy these.

44
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,250
-Toothbrush.
-Toothbrush.

45
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,100
Dried Laver.

46
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,840
-We don't need this.
-Why?

47
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,920
We are not buying this either.

48
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,910
Hey! You are really...

49
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,550
Bring over the sausage. Hurry!

50
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,960
It's good.

51
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,000
Move away!

52
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,850
What's wrong?

53
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,720
It's cold.

54
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,070
Delicious.

55
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,300
Shin Goon.

56
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,610
Can I ask you something?

57
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,870
Yes, say it.

58
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,390
Did you really bring me here to see the sunrise?

59
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,620
It's not normal and a little weird...

60
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,750
Could it be... this is our farewell trip?

61
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,350
What?

62
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,850
Why do you think of it that way?

63
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
The other time you said those, Hyorin also.

64
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,750
Don't restrict yourself just because of Hyorin.

65
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,740
I'm not in the mood to have a farewell trip.

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,830
Farewell trip. It's a bit old-fashioned. right?

67
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,250
Even though the rice is a bit uncooked,
it is still delicious.

68
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,410
Then what do you think of
us living together for 100 years?

69
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,830
Shin Goon, I didn't do it on purpose.

70
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,920
You are the first person to spit rice on a Prince's face.

71
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,450
I am sorry.

72
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,000
Sometimes I want to let you go.

73
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,510
But sometimes, I wouldn't want to let you go.

74
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,100
So, before my heart wants to let you go...

75
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,000
Growing old together is not a bad idea.

76
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,650
Why?

77
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,990
Are you afraid of being bored again?

78
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,420
No, because I can feel happiness
when I'm with you.

79
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,890
What do we do now?

80
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,360
I think we can't see the sunrise
because of this weather.

81
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,630
Let's come back again next time.

82
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,680
You know...

83
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,620
Looking at your expression...

84
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,150
I can feel that you are hurt and more lonely than I do.

85
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,820
So... from then onwards...

86
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,550
From then on, I can't help but to fall for you.

87
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,600
What is this?

88
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,690
Computer has a remote control?

89
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,790
Everything in the Palace is automatic.

90
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,190
The secret room's door is automatic
and so as the computer.

91
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,260
You just behave and watch.

92
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,550
It should be all nicely photographed.

93
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,580
With this pretty face.

94
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,030
There it goes!

95
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
The Imperial Officer can also take a look at my beauty.

96
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,110
Yes, Mama.

97
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,700
When did you take that picture?
You took it secretly?

98
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,160
Those shots are cute.

99
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Another snapshot.

100
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,360
Hey! I am quite photogenic right?

101
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,860
You look weird.

102
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,700
Your face is so big.

103
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,850
My face size is like this.

104
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,700
You keep quiet.

105
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,660
Got it.

106
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,320
What are those?

107
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,630
Shin Goon you~!
You are so bad...

108
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,790
Are you trying to embarrass me in front of the Imperial Officer?

109
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,150
Ahjushi, please don't laugh.

110
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,740
-That's a good shot.
-It's dad.

111
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,410
Dad?

112
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,840
Chaegyung.

113
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,330
Of course,
it's the same as your dad buying it.

114
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,600
Our madam Lee Soon Ae is already a legend in the insurance world.

115
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,770
Give me.

116
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,840
Princess!

117
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,200
When we married you off into the royal family, we didn't give you anything.

118
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,080
I will make it up to you this time.
Mom originally is so generous.

119
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,220
Just forget about the car accident,
you had the other time.

120
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,540
This car is definitely better than that car the Great Queen gave you.

121
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,680
Princess, you can never be looked down upon.

122
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,140
Hey, pig! Take care of this car, ok!

123
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,420
When I get my license,
I will take it back immediately.

124
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,310
So you have to take good care of it.

125
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,750
Chaegyung!

126
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,450
First you have to be careful, second to be careful, third you still have to be careful.

127
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Do you understand?

128
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,080
I miss you, Chaegyung...

129
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,560
Hey pig, you must remember what I told you okay?

130
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,910
Pyeha.

131
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,380
Since your return to the palace, are you over working yourself?

132
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,000
It'll be great if the Crown Prince can help out on a time like this.

133
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,500
When Pyeha wasn't in the palace...

134
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,220
The Crown Prince did considerably well.

135
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,630
You should trust and leave it to him,
how about that?

136
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,740
I have difficulty trusting the Crown Prince lately.

137
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,730
Pyeha. The Crown Prince is still young and needs care and guidance.

138
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,590
At this times,
we need to help him go on the right path.

139
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,960
The Crown Prince's behavior has become a public discussion since the last incident.

140
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,860
The history and traditions of the royal family is also the guide for the people.

141
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,580
The reason for the existence of the royal family,

142
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,510
is because there are people who worked hard to keep the royal family.

143
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,650
At this times, guidance is very important.

144
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,960
Pyeha should have more understanding towards the Prince with an open heart.

145
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,330
I will do all I can to help you.

146
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,960
Mama. Hwi Sung Goon Mama has arrived.

147
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,610
Hwi Sung Dae Goon?

148
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,820
Let him in.

149
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,100
Come in, Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

150
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,870
What brings you here?

151
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,170
-I have something to tell you.
-Is it?

152
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,110
Pyeha, I will leave now.
Both of you have a good chat.

153
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,490
I came here to discuss about the on going cultural festival we are organizing.

154
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,730
This is precious.

155
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
This is supposed to be the job of the Crown Prince.

156
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,950
But it is you, Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

157
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,530
You ran away from home too?

158
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,870
How did you get here?

159
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,860
Take a look at this.

160
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,140
Look.

161
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,770
What's with that expression?

162
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,180
She still thinks that she's the Crown Princess?

163
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,140
So annoying.

164
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,900
It is still the same as it used to be in here.

165
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,550
Since first year of high school,
I avoided schoolmates and met you here.

166
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,250
Do you still remember what happened in Thailand?

167
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,450
Perhaps you are trying to forget it
but I really liked it a lot.

168
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,930
Shopping in that Tuk Tuk.

169
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,120
Hiding in that guest house to avoid the paparazzi.

170
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,120
I can't forget everything.

171
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,000
Even though I'm always like a shadow friend...

172
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,790
But that time,
I really felt like your true friend.

173
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,080
Thank you.

174
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,830
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

175
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:49,010
You really like her?

176
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,850
I think I am falling for her already.

177
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,100
-Let's get married.
-What did you say?

178
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,840
You didn't hear it clearly?

179
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,200
I am proposing to you now.

180
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,840
Rather than getting married
to someone I have not even met.

181
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,300
We are friends that know each other well.

182
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,700
I think I am falling for her already.

183
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,000
Myorn Nam Pyeong!

184
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,700
It hurts right? What are you doing?

185
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,070
Look at this.

186
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,980
-Why?
-Nothing.

187
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,510
-You took a picture of me right?
-What are you talking about?

188
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,930
-Why should I take pictures of you.
-I heard the sound.

189
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,780
Hey! Hey! What a terrible thing!
Hyorin! Hyorin...!

190
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,780
Why?! What's wrong with her?

191
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,040
-She overdosed herself with pills!
-What???

192
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,290
In the toilet.

193
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,780
Oh my! How can this be?

194
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,770
Move away.

195
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,100
I want to see too.
What is going on...

196
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,950
Isn't it so? This is unbelievable...
What happened?

197
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,700
Let go see.

198
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,600
Kang Hyun, is this true?

199
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,400
-Oh my!
-Please be quite.

200
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,230
Shouldn't you go to visit Hyorin?

201
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,270
You woke up already?

202
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,190
The owner of this hospital is my uncle.

203
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,710
Let me change the ward.

204
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,510
With my family background,
I can't afford a ward like this.

205
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,940
Don't be like this Hyorin. It's okay.

206
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't worry about the hospital bills.
I will take care of it.

207
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,380
Since when did you know about it?

208
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,800
From the start.

209
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,700
Hyorin. Please let go and stop.

210
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
You are the one who is going to get hurt.

211
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,000
You think Shin is going to come back to you?

212
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,600
Don't wait for him.

213
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,700
If he ever thinks about coming back to you,
then you wouldn't have to wait till today.

214
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,890
You turn out like this, all because of him.

215
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,440
But his shadow is not even around now.

216
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,830
Get well soon. Practice ballet again.

217
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,050
What?

218
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,190
What happened?

219
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,650
Yeah, this is the first time seeing her so depressed.

220
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,640
Is it because of me?

221
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,660
I was shocked too.

222
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,340
I didn't think that Hyorin would do that.

223
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,090
Yul Goon, why did Hyorin do such a thing?

224
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,930
Was it because of me?

225
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,050
If I didn't come between the two of them,

226
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,760
Then Hyorin wouldn't do what she did.

227
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,700
Is it because of Shin that she suffers?

228
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,710
I understand Hyorin's feelings.

229
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:19,100
Her mind wants to give up
but the feelings got stronger.

230
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,620
But, is it necessary to do what she did?

231
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,690
Chaegyung.

232
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,540
Please give back Hyorin's place.

233
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,120
What do you mean?

234
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,190
From the beginning, it belonged to Hyorin.

235
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,050
Before Shin is dethrone,
it is impossible to have a divorce.

236
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,460
So you should let go first.

237
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,280
But Shin also treats me...

238
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,870
Although I don't know whether Shin is opening his heart to you,

239
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,530
His feelings for Hyorin were happier
than his feelings for you.

240
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,250
In the end, Shin will  go back to Hyorin.

241
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,350
But, he is married to me.

242
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,370
Getting a divorce could make it harder for Shin.

243
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,350
That's a problem that Shin needs to choose.

244
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,740
Hyorin is having a hard time
from the memory of love.

245
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:39,420
It might be the end of this situation,
we will return to our original positions.

246
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,940
The positions we were in the beginning.

247
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,020
Who is this person?

248
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,500
He was a friend of the late King Hyo Ryul,

249
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,250
the editing chief of a newspaper publishing company.

250
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:06,700
Hye Jung Gong has sought him out since her arrival.

251
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,490
From what I see, the reports about Hye Jung Gong's welfare activities.

252
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,450
This person must be the mastermind behind it.

253
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,940
Is that so?

254
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,600
If it is, then the Thailand gossip article could be connected to this person?

255
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,360
It must be so, Mama.

256
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,350
To obtain the information, he might even sent the paparazzi after them.

257
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,000
Judging from his indistinct whereabouts,
it seems that he started the matter first.

258
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,450
That must be it.

259
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,050
Please check this child, as to what kind of relationship she has with Hye Jung Gong.

260
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
Yes, Mama.

261
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,010
You really can't look through a person's heart.

262
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,700
How can she resort to all means to satisfy her own selfish desires?

263
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,070
What if because of this child, the Prince involved again in another scandal?

264
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,820
That'll be a life-threatening blow to the Prince.

265
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,450
So Internal officer, you'll have an extra effort regarding this matter.

266
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Yes, I understand, Hwang-Hu Mama.

267
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,060
Choi Sang Gong unni, you have a very pretty face, and a nice body,

268
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,110
You must have a lot of suitors.

269
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,390
What I'm trying to say is...

270
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,940
Please tell me, Princess.

271
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,350
It's not my story but my friend Hwi Sung's story.

272
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,830
She is really having a hard time these days.

273
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,480
She has a guy that she likes but she doesn't know whether he likes her or doesn't like her.

274
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,210
So, she can't really understand...

275
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:39,030
Anyway, that guy had a girl he really liked...

276
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,970
But the girl couldn't let go of that guy and so things were really difficult.

277
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:54,590
She doesn't really know the guy's feeling that well so she thinks of giving up...

278
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,100
Does she need to give that guy back to that girl?

279
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,800
Does your friend truly love that guy?

280
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,640
Yes, of course! It should be like that.

281
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,030
Bingung Mama, you must trust your heart.

282
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,630
If you really feel that way, then it should be.

283
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,690
That is the truth's principle.

284
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,610
I told you it's not my story but,
Soon Young's story.

285
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:39,030
There's a possibility that your heart has already been conveyed, Mama.

286
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,290
I told you it's not my story.

287
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,800
That's why I don't know my feelings.

288
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,380
Did you hate me that much?

289
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,250
Enough to do this kind of thing.

290
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,850
Do you know who's Romeo's first love?

291
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,250
Romeo's first love was not Juliet but Rosaline.

292
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:08,100
Romeo was in love with Rosaline one-sidedly.
And so, he was suffering in pain.

293
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,000
Upon meeting Juliet at a party
he falls in love at first sight.

294
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Rosaline is just forgotten.

295
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:26,000
People only know Romeo and Juliet, they don't know who Rosaline was.

296
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,680
In their relationship,
Rosaline was just an extra.

297
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,710
She's just a first love that passed by and a forgotten bygone love.

298
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,680
Romeo.

299
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,430
Why is your love so insignificant?

300
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,470
How is it that you change so easily?

301
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,360
I'm sorry.

302
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,710
I'm going to visit Hyorin,
why don't we go together?

303
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,310
Hyorin is too pitiful.

304
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,710
Yes, so let's go to the hospital together now.

305
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,000
If we hold the card for too long,
it will start to counter-attack.

306
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,050
So now, it's the time to throw out that card.

307
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:44,970
To say that anyone can be real, and that anyone can be nothing ... is scary.

308
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,180
What are you saying?

309
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,880
If we had met earlier,
Hyorin would not be like this either.

310
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:02,330
That's why everyone became unfortunate because we met too late.

311
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,100
You... what do you mean?

312
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,610
I'm sorry Mom,
I'm not in the mood to go visiting.

313
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:56,050
Hyorin, do you feel okay?

314
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,620
Here, this is...

315
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,450
Just go.

316
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,020
I don't want to see you.

317
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,020
Mama, it's Park Sang Gong.

318
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,750
Yes, what is it?

319
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,740
It's okay, hurry up and speak.

320
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,750
Mama, Hyorin committed suicide and she's in the hospital right now.

321
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,550
Hyorin?

322
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,000
Princess, you know that child?

323
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,890
Yes, she was Shin's old girlfriend.

324
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,840
From what I know she is an unfortunate child,

325
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,700
though she is from a difficult home, she didn't give up on her dream.

326
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,050
She practices ballet very hard and has now become a ballerina who receives attention.

327
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,330
She tried to commit suicide, it seems that Shin must have hurt her seriously.

328
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,650
She's not a person with such a weak will.

329
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,700
To say that after passing one hill another hill awaits,

330
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,010
I don't know what to do.

331
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,650
Mother, this situation is quite serious.

332
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,010
This situation must not get big.

333
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,940
Park sang Gong,
is that child still in the hospital?

334
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,080
Yes, Mama.

335
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,550
OK.

336
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,970
Do you know the latest rumors that's in the internal of the palace?

337
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,550
There have been discussion about
the Prince's qualifications.

338
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,770
It may get so serious that Prince may be abolished.

339
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,730
Thinking about Shin makes me anxious.

340
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,160
If he was being abolished,
who else can he be together with?

341
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,490
Once, I think of Shin being on his own.
I feel really bad.

342
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,880
There's Chaegyung.

343
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,150
The political marriage which existed by force...

344
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,000
with addition of helping Chaegyung's family which was on the edge of bankruptcy as a condition.

345
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,050
Will that kind of marriage be able to maintain?
Especially after the abolishment?

346
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,570
The way I see it, it seems like those people don't seem to be affectionate with each other.

347
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,380
It must be because of the
bad term rumors going on lately...

348
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,970
So they must put on a show
for everyone to see.

349
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,700
Shin is a very responsible child.

350
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,750
It's possible that he's together with the Crown Princess because of his sense of responsibilities.

351
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,350
It will be the first time in history that a Crown Prince gets dethrone.

352
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,250
It will be a very big blow to Shin.

353
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:59,700
So how can that silly girl comfort the depressed Shin in that situation?

354
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,290
He will return to your side.

355
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:11,000
But if that happens it'll be hard for Shin and it'll be very hard for me as well.

356
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,520
Do you know what the most effective way of going to heaven is?

357
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,000
It's the knowledge of knowing
which way is it to heaven.

358
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,560
This is the Hell you must pass through in order to go to Heaven.

359
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,050
You must bear it. If you bear it you can get anything you want.

360
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,830
The book fell.

361
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,050
Shin Goon.

362
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,790
Say it. What is it?

363
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:37,110
You went to see Hyorin yesterday, right?

364
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,000
I know that you went.

365
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,170
I went today too.

366
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,430
Why did you go there?!

367
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,990
What?

368
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,770
Because of you she was there,
of course we have to visit her, right?

369
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,690
I'll do my business on my own.

370
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,140
Why are you so angry?

371
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,390
I don't like you concerning yourself
about that kind of stuff.

372
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,770
Mama.

373
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,680
Yes.

374
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,710
What is this?

375
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,680
Awfully, they say that female student attempted to commit suicide.

376
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,150
Mama.

377
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,310
Is that so? The response is much stronger than what we expect.

378
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,080
We must keep on creating waves and keep striking when we are winning until he falls.

379
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,020
We only have that  one chance.

380
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,370
Through all these countless
temptations I trusted you.

381
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,000
It must be a misunderstanding,
it must be a passing rumor.

382
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,700
But, this is the result of that respect?

383
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,750
This was the conclusion?!

384
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,710
Instead of sitting with your mouth shut, don't you have to say something?

385
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,030
How in the world did all this happen?!

386
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,320
Father, Shin is very flustered right now, seem like he doesn't know what to say.

387
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,320
Please suppress yourself and Shin will think of what to say and again...

388
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,300
Can't you hear what I'm saying?!
Hurry and speak!!

389
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,850
Is the Prince ignoring his Father and looking down at the King??

390
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,160
Don't you at least give an explanation!

391
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,960
-Pyeha, please don't raise your voice.
-I have nothing to say.

392
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:11,650
Is that so... everything is the truth?

393
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,520
During the whole time you lied at everything.

394
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,640
What an evil fellow.

395
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,100
Father, from how I see it
this situation is not Shin's fault,

396
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,910
but rather after someone plans it with a purpose to enlarge the reports.

397
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,540
That's enough, stop it.

398
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,600
The Imperial Household has been bestowed with a hell that cannot be erased.

399
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,230
And do you think that you have the competency to be a King?

400
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,680
Leave.

401
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,130
Father.

402
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,660
Shin Goon, are you okay?
What did the King say?

403
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,120
Shin Goon!

404
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,510
Shin Goon!

405
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,190
Let Shin go.
He needs to be alone right now.

406
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,650
But...

407
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:52,300
Chaegyung, this is only between Shin and Hyorin's problem to resolve.

408
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,350
That is the first time that I've seen Shin with such a troubled face.

409
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,030
If I leave him alone,
I think it'll be hard for me.

410
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,940
If you go you'll get hurt from Shin again.

411
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,780
Shin is not the kind of guy to care about others in this kind of situation.

412
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,520
It's okay if I get hurt.

413
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,200
Shin is often troubled because he is alone.

414
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,340
So I don't want to leave him alone anymore.

415
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,000
Can't you see me?

416
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,440
Why can't you see the real me whose heart is hurting because of you?

417
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,980
Shin Goon, you can't do this, go back and ask for forgiveness.

418
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,000
Running away like this is such a childish act.

419
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,640
You are the Crowned Prince.

420
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,090
That's enough. It's all over.

421
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,410
Mama, the wind outside is cold.

422
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,100
Yes, Mama, please go inside.

423
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:34,900
Shin is fine and nothing to worry about, right?

424
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:39,000
It must be nothing.
No matter...

425
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,160
Hello?

426
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes.

427
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,510
Yes, I'm okay.

428
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,800
Announce please.

429
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,650
My apologies, Tae-Hu Mama.

430
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:36,710
The Queen says she does not want to meet anyone.

431
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,540
Where is she?

432
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,500
What is it you speak of?

433
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,230
I'm speaking about that child.

434
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,770
The truth is that I am also curious about the whereabouts of that child.

435
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,430
I thought that she seemed to be a nice child.

436
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,120
I don't understand why the Prince threw her and married Chaegyung.

437
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:16,780
Can it be that the Prince is regretting it?

438
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:26,290
I will also meet the child soon.
I'll know when I meet her.

439
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:46,320
Hello? Is this Min Hyorin's hand phone?
Yes, wait a moment.

440
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,520
Mama, the phone is connected.

441
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,410
Hello?

442
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,360
Yes, Hwang-Hu Mama.

443
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,140
The number you dialed is not available.

444
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,870
I didn't want to lean on you that much.

445
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,470
But it always ends up that way.

446
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:39,050
Whenever you need me,
I'd like you to lean on me.

447
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:46,650
I was angry. Until I went to the hospital,
I was regretful and sorry.

448
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,030
But now I can't understand.

449
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,640
But it doesn't have to be like that..

450
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:57,210
If you like him that much, you can't make it difficult for the person you like.

451
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,410
You don't know if she did it because she wanted it but couldn't have it.

452
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,450
If you make Shin this troubled,
does that mean you get him?

453
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,300
You want Shin's heart too.

454
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:26,150
Although that's true,
I won't forcefully take what I can't have.

455
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,630
That's being greedy.

456
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:38,040
Are you that worried?

457
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,370
I think that just being annoying and troublesome on the side is better.

458
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,320
Because he's not here,
I get anxious and worried.

459
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,400
You still haven't found Hyorin?

460
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,270
Even if you have to uproot all the houses, find her immediately.

461
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,670
Yes, Mama.
