1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,950
Episode 17

2
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,140
I have been thinking about the past.

3
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,640
Do you still remember?

4
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,060
The train tickets we kept when we first met.

5
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,260
We made a pact to open it 10 years later.

6
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,970
But I guess there wouldn't be such a day already so I took it out.

7
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,800
To a person like me...

8
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,650
the warm memories I shared with someone,

9
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,400
it seems like it is not easy to wipe it away.

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,020
It's very stupid but...

11
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,950
after giving you up, I just realized...

12
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,990
The importance of your existence in my heart.

13
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,150
Perhaps...

14
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,350
Till the end,
I can't bear giving up my love away.

15
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,200
But from now on,

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,800
there won't be any entanglement from me anymore.

17
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,670
Because everything is wiped off.

18
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,830
To me... Shin's existence...

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,090
There is nothing that can replace that.

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,610
And there's nothing to be snatched away either.

21
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,230
I've acknowledged it.

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,600
Lee Shin and Shin Chaegyung.

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,090
I didn't mean to let things go this far, putting you up in a difficult position.

24
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,370
I'm sorry for the things that
have gone out of hands.

25
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,350
Hyorin.

26
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,100
It seems that you already walked too far.

27
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,670
Right. I was feeling frustrated.
Luckily you called.

28
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,010
If the boredom carries on, show us the dance power of the Crown Prince.

29
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,240
I am thirsty.
Get me something to drink.

30
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,190
Go get it then.

31
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,980
Let's go together.

32
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,880
Don't want to.

33
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,950
Why? My treat.

34
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,730
Really?

35
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,360
You brought shame to the Royal family which has never happen before.

36
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,420
You think you still have
the right to become the king?

37
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,900
Jerk, where is Hyorin?!?

38
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,890
Where did you hide Hyorin?

39
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,220
Kang In, don't do that.

40
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,800
What are you doing?

41
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,930
Why tarnish your reputation like this?

42
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,510
Don't bother.

43
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,110
What's wrong?

44
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,170
Playing with someone's heart...

45
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,550
is it interesting?

46
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,280
What are you saying?

47
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,090
I met Hyorin earlier than you did...

48
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,460
but I still gave Hyorin to you.

49
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,570
I thought that would make her happier.

50
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,640
But...

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,510
My thinking was wrong.

52
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,690
You are not someone that
can give someone happiness.

53
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,050
You...

54
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,930
Just care about yourself.

55
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,550
Living a full life under
the elegance as a Crown Prince.

56
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,650
Things like someone's heart didn't even cross your mind right?

57
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,760
That is a bit too much.

58
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,350
You are despicable.

59
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,500
If it was me...

60
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,150
At the least, I wouldn't do things like leaving someone I love and marrying someone else.

61
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,570
Because of your irresponsible act,

62
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,180
Hyorin suffers all the hurts.

63
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,320
It seems like you've forgotten.

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,350
I am the Crown Prince of this country.

65
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,440
Comparing to you people who talk about love all day, I have more responsibilities.

66
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,900
Is that so?

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,340
Amongst the tons of responsibilities you have,

68
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,940
Why did you leave Hyorin behind?

69
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,130
If I can't hold the responsibility till the end,

70
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,940
I wouldn't choose to start it.
That is my principle of doing things.

71
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,020
As a friend, the listening of advice,

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,710
ends here for now.

73
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,640
This isn't the first time Shin acts like that.

74
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Just forget it. Let's go dance.

75
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,200
Don't provoke me.

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
Don't act like that.

77
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,540
Go dance and release some stress.

78
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,670
That's right.

79
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,750
What the heck are you all doing?

80
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,900
Yah. Are you all joking?

81
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,280
What?

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,260
I'm really sorry to bother you with such matters.

83
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,540
I've been waiting for you since I got your call.

84
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I am the Crown Prince's Palace Assistance.

85
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,620
This is the royal family's lawyer, Lawyer Han.

86
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,460
What exactly has happened?

87
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,930
How...

88
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,460
What happened?

89
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,910
Who is that uncle?

90
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,480
I heard he's from the police station.

91
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,670
Police station?

92
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,830
Why?

93
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,050
We don't know, Mama. But it doesn't look good.

94
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,550
But it doesn't look good.

95
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,110
The situation right now is
not favorable to the Crown Prince.

96
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,240
The matters regarding the Crown Prince, is there anything as reference? We have to investigate on it.

97
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,150
- What is your opinion?
- It is possible.

98
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,820
If it is like that ,
it can be used as reference.

99
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,690
I will come up with a more detailed report.

100
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,690
The Crown Prince is not around now.

101
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,190
Nice to meet you, Bingung Mama.

102
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,450
Gung Nae Gwan ajuhshi...

103
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,270
What happened?

104
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,920
Don't tell me it's Shin?

105
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,350
What happened?

106
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,840
Continue.

107
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,960
In different situations...

108
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,370
What is it?

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,200
Someone mentioned that he saw Crown Prince at the crime scene.

110
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,630
Hyorin is missing.

111
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,020
She's something that we can make use of.

112
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,150
But it seems like someone is ahead of us.

113
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
Stop provoking Hyorin.

114
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,580
She has hurt enough.

115
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,080
Hurt will automatically
heal after time passes by.

116
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,830
But a person's will becomes stronger
because of these hurts.

117
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,590
We need someone who can affect Shin directly.

118
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,680
Tae-Hu Mama, Kwak Sang Gong has arrived.

119
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,980
Come in.

120
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,240
What is the matter?

121
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,140
The Crown Prince is being involved in a violent incident.

122
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,580
He's now being questioned by the police as someone related to it.

123
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,970
He really got himself entangled in a web.

124
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,720
We're just going by the flow.

125
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,420
He seems to be falling in deeper.

126
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,110
How can you be like this?
I was so worried for you.

127
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,730
You went out like that,
you didn't even try to contact me...

128
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,630
You try that one more time,
I would let you off.

129
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,300
Go back first.

130
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,150
It's late.

131
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,190
I know Shin Goon always keeps everything to himself and suffers alone...

132
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,730
But, I am also suffering if you're like this.

133
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,160
We are a set.

134
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,380
Why is it that I'm always away from your side?

135
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,190
You can't lean on me for once?

136
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,930
Why do you always suffer alone? Stupid.

137
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,710
I am tired.

138
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,120
Don't say anything anymore.

139
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,000
I am worried about you.

140
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,960
Where are you, what are you doing...

141
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,110
That stubborn temperament of yours, would you get into trouble.

142
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,220
Do you know how much I'm worried?

143
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,390
Can't breath...  Why are you...

144
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,530
Even if I'm not the Crown Prince anymore...

145
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,320
please stay by my side.

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,980
The Crown Prince didn't participate in this act of violence directly.

147
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,180
This is just a routine check.

148
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,890
Yes. Pyeha.

149
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,720
I received the reports already.
There shouldn't be any problem.

150
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,050
Recently, the Royal Family hasn't been portraying a very good image to the public.

151
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,130
I believe I don't have to elaborate on the reason.

152
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,350
For requesting you to make a trip so late in the night.

153
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,820
Can I think of it this way?

154
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,500
Of course, Pyeha.

155
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,580
I will handle this with care.

156
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,400
The Queen doesn't need to be too worried about this.

157
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,570
The Queen has requested this secret visit so it wasn't a comfortable journey.

158
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,040
The Queen will be arriving now.
Please wait a moment.

159
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,930
Yes, I know.

160
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,400
This is honey mandarin flower tea.

161
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,830
- Please enjoy your drink.
- Thank you.

162
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,930
I heard you are a ballet dancer?

163
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,380
Yes, Mama.

164
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,680
I heard you rejected the Crown Prince's proposal because of your ambitions.

165
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,080
I think that you are a very bright girl.

166
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,800
Yes, Mama.

167
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,110
As a woman myself, I can totally understand how Hyorin must feel.

168
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,660
Because of this incident,
you must have worried a lot also.

169
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:45,330
And because of this,
I am also worried you.

170
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,810
My deepest apologies, Mama.

171
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,950
Also, even though you grew up in a difficult environment you did not give up your dream,

172
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,250
and you became an attention-focused ballet dancer.

173
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,890
If I become the one who can support Hyorin's dreams, how about that?

174
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,910
I am thankful but...

175
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,390
To become the world famous ballet dancer...

176
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,540
You'll need someone who can support you.

177
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,860
To produce the perfect environment so that you can concentrate on your arts...

178
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,340
That I feel, is the best way to produce a great artist.

179
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,270
The royal family is also researching on students like you

180
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,940
who can carry on the fight of one's own dream, despite the harsh environment

181
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,640
and also to give all kinds of aids to those who need them.

182
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,440
The Crown Prince is already someone's pillar of support.

183
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,920
He is someone who will succeed the crown to rule the country.

184
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,880
Do you understand what I mean?

185
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,480
Yes, Mama.

186
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh? Hyorin?

187
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,250
I am not too sure of what I should say.

188
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,440
Should I ask, "Are you okay?"

189
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,060
or should I ask, "how have you been doing?"

190
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,110
I will bury Shin deep inside my heart,

191
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,900
if one day Shin wants to come back to me,

192
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,320
regardless of when that time is,
I will gladly accept him again.

193
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,490
We as friends, did we give each other too much pain and misery?

194
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,360
But...

195
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,030
I slowly realized that you are a good person.

196
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,080
Him being with me, it is not only for happiness and the comfort he gets...

197
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,050
I know.

198
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,990
Don't let go of Shin.

199
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,360
I am going.

200
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,740
Have some tea before you go.

201
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,960
I'll just go.

202
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,370
Thank you.

203
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,010
There are a lot of depressing things happening in the Palace recently.

204
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,770
It is because I didn't teach the Crown Prince properly. It is my fault.

205
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,530
At this point of time, Mama has
to take care of her health.

206
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,740
Mama's health...

207
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,870
is the balance of the royal family.

208
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,860
Yes.

209
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,530
I will accept your kind advice and get better as fast as possible.

210
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,620
You are welcome, Mama.

211
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,200
Why don't you look good either?

212
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:46,300
It is because the Jong Jin having very strong discussions regarding the quality of the Crown Prince.

213
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,400
Is that so?

214
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,650
It seems that it started because of the Crown Prince's scandal.

215
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,960
Especially after that violent act
toward Yul Sung Dae Goon.

216
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,120
The elders were very angry.

217
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,410
The situation is getting us, the mother and son in a very awkward position.

218
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,530
My deepest apologies, Mama.

219
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,880
I, believe in the Crown Prince.

220
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,150
The Crown Prince has the sense of responsibility that is stronger than anyone else.

221
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:30,350
When he succeed the crown, he will be put in for more responsibilities.

222
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,400
My deepest apologies, Mama.

223
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,220
The position of a King is not determined by the people, but by the Heavens above.

224
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,240
It is wrong to have such
discussions regarding that position.

225
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,770
Regarding Hyorin, you sure work fast, Hwang-Hu.

226
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,100
It is something that affects the Crown Prince.

227
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,850
As a mother, what would I not do?

228
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,770
That is really touching, Hwang-Hu.

229
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,980
It's the Crown Prince that smears the reputation of the royal family.

230
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,250
Can the Crown Prince become a king who will be loved and respected by the citizens?

231
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,890
It seems that Tae-Hu Mama thinks too lightly in the power of truth.

232
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,030
Did you call for me, Pyeha?

233
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,140
Yes. Please sit down.

234
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,790
Kim Dae Gwan, please sit down too.

235
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,930
Yes, Pyeha.

236
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,510
After entering the Palace...

237
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,150
do you experience lots of difficulties?

238
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,400
No.

239
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,340
With the your blessings...

240
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,130
I am doing very well.

241
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,090
There must be somewhat inconvenient to have lived in such a broken down place.

242
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,690
And also, from now on, Kim Dae Gwan here...

243
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,520
He'll be assisting Dae Goon.

244
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,790
Actually this should've been done earlier.
I only decided on this now, hopefully you'd understand.

245
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,230
No, that's okay, Pyeha.

246
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,740
Dae Goon Mama, Kim Nae Gwan hereby officially send you my regards.

247
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,450
Kim Nae Gwan will not only handle your daily necessities...

248
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,350
he will also help you out in the work areas.

249
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
Thanks for your guidance in the near future.

250
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,030
What kind of words is that? Dae Goon Mama.

251
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,880
It is me who should ask for your guidance.

252
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,880
About the suggestion in regards
of the overseas artifacts.

253
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,250
From now on, inside the palace...

254
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,330
Hwi Sung Dae Goon will have to help me out in a lot of things.

255
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,440
I will anticipate the results from
both you and Kim Dae Gwan.

256
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,600
Yes.

257
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,300
Even though it's not good enough, I will try to do my best.

258
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,050
You don't look so good.

259
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,300
I heard you met with the Queen?

260
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,810
Yes, Teacher.

261
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,660
Hyorin, do you know...

262
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,710
How scary the royals are?

263
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,610
They can't tolerate anything that'll affect their benefits.

264
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,930
I'm so worried that you might get hurt.

265
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,150
Because of the overseas report...

266
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,040
Many people got hurt and got into difficult situations.

267
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,340
It is time for me to stand up and clear up the mess.

268
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,770
Hyorin? What do you mean?

269
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
You will suffer more like that.

270
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,830
I will help you.

271
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,530
Whether it is some other things or the royals, I will back you up.

272
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,870
You have to give up those.

273
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,630
How can there be no sacrifices, if you want to get something you want?

274
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,650
You must have the courage.

275
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,210
You will get what you want.

276
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,560
I don't want to rush myself into making a decision.

277
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,250
As long as I wait, whether it is a dream or love...

278
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,150
They will come back to me again someday.

279
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,820
Thank you.

280
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,280
Yes. Shin and I are schoolmates.

281
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,510
And as what the rumors say,
we did have dated for 2 years.

282
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,950
I heard that the Crown Prince did propose to you?

283
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,550
Yes, he did propose.

284
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,560
But I rejected him.

285
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,500
Because to me,
my dream is more precious.

286
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,210
I'm not what the rumors say, "A woman abandoned by the Crown Prince".

287
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,580
I chose this myself.

288
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,820
And I am not regretting that decision.

289
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,860
Is there nothing else you want to say?

290
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,340
Yes.

291
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,740
Can I take a picture of you?

292
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,840
I am sorry.

293
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,280
Right now, I just want to be Min Hyorin, the ballerina.

294
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,890
Oh oh, okay, okay...
Just follow the road line!

295
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,820
YAH!

296
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,320
How many times do I have to say it?!
Step on the brakes lightly!

297
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,110
You are doing this on purpose, aren't you?!

298
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,440
No...

299
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,150
I didn't do this on purpose.

300
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,880
I did step on it lightly.

301
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,690
If you step on it lightly,
will a person get flunk out of the seat?

302
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,080
Does it hurt a lot?

303
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,170
Ok. Let's try once again.

304
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,500
Place the back of your foot on the ground.

305
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,570
Use the front of your foot to step on the accelerator. Understand?

306
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,360
Like this?

307
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,750
Okay, now try to drive...

308
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm going...

309
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,050
Slowly...

310
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,580
Going... aah!

311
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,430
Don't be so tense, relax...

312
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,890
The signals lights! The signals!

313
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,700
Signals?

314
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,920
Quickly turn on the headlights!

315
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,180
Stop shouting!

316
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm nervous enough already!

317
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,090
It's because you're too retarded!

318
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,140
This is the first time,
meeting with such an idiot.

319
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,440
That's enough!

320
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,900
You drove very well when you just started driving?

321
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,400
If you keep throwing your temper,
I will drive by myself!

322
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,450
Ok, restart again.

323
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,790
I know.

324
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,960
We'll drive straight.

325
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,220
Left turn, left turn!

326
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,160
Left turn.

327
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,200
Yah. LEFT TURN!

328
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,250
Left turn!

329
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,110
Why does it keep going to the left?!!

330
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,480
You kept turning left!!!

331
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,080
But I am driving straight!!!

332
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,470
I say how did you do that?!!

333
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,940
I want to get off the car!!

334
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,940
I say I want to get off!!!!

335
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,470
Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama, it is Suh Sang Gong.

336
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,850
Please come in, Nanny.

337
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
Welcome, Nanny.

338
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,890
Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama,
do you still remember?

339
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,020
When you were younger and you ate youkan, you always had to add ice in with it.

340
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,710
I remember.

341
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,540
I still remember the taste of
the youkan that you made.

342
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:23,600
I made this after thinking about the past, Mama.

343
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,530
Nanny.

344
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,170
Yes, Mama?

345
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,300
After the change in the owner for 14 years, how was the Palace like?

346
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:41,500
If my dad was still alive, the Palace would be in a different state, right?

347
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,500
If my dad didn't pass away,

348
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,200
the original position between me and Shin would not have changed..

349
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,810
That's what I sometimes ponder about.

350
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,590
My deep apology, Mama.

351
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,950
The memories about my dad doesn't get to me.

352
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:09,450
But, the old Palace and my dad's face are still vividly remained in my mind.

353
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,420
Dae Goon Mama, you must have a strong heart.

354
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,300
Dae Goon Mama, there might be a problem that you may not be able to handle.

355
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:29,520
Nanny... Would I really be able to become the Prince?

356
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:37,020
I would put all my effort and help Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama.

357
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
During this time, the royal family's efforts towards the Cultural heritage activities

358
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,150
have not been receiving excellent results.

359
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
The citizens have been giving us support

360
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,900
for preserving the image of the traditional culture

361
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,200
and with us involving in the welfare activities.

362
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,200
But now, we need to do more.
We are not just going to be a type of symbolism.

363
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,300
We're not the royal family that's being tied down like existing puppets.

364
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,900
But we're the royal family
that's alive and has strong power.

365
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,500
I know the blueprints of the royal family plans that my father was unable to achieve.

366
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,900
It's also time to show everyone, the new future that my father had wished for the royal family.

367
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,300
Oh no! How embarrassing!

368
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,730
I really didn't know that it was your birthday.

369
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,670
It's okay, Hwang-Hu Mama.

370
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,540
Please don't blame yourself.

371
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,630
When I was in England...

372
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,150
I'm not sure if it's because I was living in an unfamiliar place...

373
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,920
but I didn't like celebrating my birthday when it arrived.

374
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,860
There were many times when I even forgot about my birthdays too.

375
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,500
What to do, Yul!
I'm sorry, I didn't know about it either.

376
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,690
Hwi Sung Dae Goon, as your grandmother, too.

377
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,010
I didn't think about it fully. So as a compensation, tell me what you want as a gift.

378
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,920
Then...

379
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,120
I was thinking about having a birthday party with my friends, please approve it.

380
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,900
Birthday party?

381
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,470
Yes.

382
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,520
I was thinking of going to the countryside nearby and spending a night and two days there.

383
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,530
If possible, I'd like to go together with the Prince and Princess too.

384
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,460
And there's already an agreement that their friends are going to come too.

385
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,200
But if it's a birthday party, then can't you do it inside the Palace?

386
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,670
The truth is that I want to do my graduation project.

387
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,930
Since it's an arts school, I have to finish my art project before I graduate.

388
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,670
From what I'm see, I don't think there's a reason why you should disagree.

389
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:02,070
Alright. The three of you can go so that you can get some fresh air and some inspiration.

390
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,210
But have you decided on where to stay?

391
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,690
Yes. Dang Sook Officer
promised to lend me his villa.

392
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,410
Oh! That's good.

393
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:20,460
I know you'll be good, but there must be no mishaps so that the people can't gossip about it.

394
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,260
We'll keep that in mind.

395
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,180
Thank you for your consent...
Halma Mama, Hwang-Hu Mama.

396
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,680
Why didn't you tell me? If Yul Goon invited us, then you should've told me.

397
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,640
What kind of birthday party spreads over a night and two days? I'm not going.

398
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,200
But if we don't go,
don't you think he'll be upset?

399
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,140
My friends told me that they got invited, too.

400
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,690
Do you really want to go?

401
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,120
I do want to go, but I really want to wish him a happy birthday.

402
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,890
On your birthday, Yul Goon also came.

403
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,930
Why do you care so much?

404
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,210
What do you mean "care"? Said who? I'm just saying that I'm going to my friend's birthday party.

405
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,930
Friend... yeah right!

406
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,400
Let's just go! Huh?

407
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,720
You're going, right?

408
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,550
The Queen has found out about your actions.

409
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,080
If this is the case,
then it isn't safe being around you either.

410
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,920
How did they find out about me?

411
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,210
You have really underestimated the Royal family's information abilities.

412
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,850
Now what can I do?

413
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,950
Leave Korea.

414
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,030
What do you mean?

415
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,280
If the Queen starts to enclose investigations,

416
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,800
it would only be a matter of time before they'll find out about me.

417
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,170
So, if we do this,
this is the path of safety between us.

418
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,590
There is no way that they'll find out it's me.

419
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,270
Moreover, if I'm not here, who will help you?

420
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,230
For someone who cannot keep their identity as a secret, how can I make that person handle such a big task?

421
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,650
I don't accept any mistake.

422
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,500
Mama, how can you do this to me?
I can't leave.

423
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:30,840
I was trying to persuade you nicely because of our past friendship, but that ends today.

424
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,050
The person who had been bestowed with great kindness from Crown Prince Hyo Ryul...

425
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,900
He's Baek Chun Ha, the son of Baek Joon Ki.

426
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:05,210
Chun Ha, you will be a loyal bodyguard of Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama.

427
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,210
Yes.

428
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,620
I heard that Head editor Choi has already left the country, Mama.

429
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,200
Is that so?

430
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,300
Did you check for other movements?

431
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,510
Right now, this is all Mama.

432
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
We must always set a plan and look out.

433
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,750
The storm always chooses to attack when everything is peaceful.

434
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,730
I understand, Mama.

435
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,990
Myung Seon Dang has changed a lot, right?

436
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,300
Time has changed many things.

437
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,770
This was the place where both of us had shared lot of memories.

438
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:55,800
One time, my Yul who had run and played around, was the royal grandson at the time.

439
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,500
Now it's impossible to take back anything, right?

440
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,820
So there is this thing called, "inherent responsibilities".

441
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,200
But since you are a man, don't you have any dreams that you want to fulfill?

442
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,070
That's exactly what housework is.

443
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,970
I really... should I say that I was born to do housework..

444
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,970
No, it's not like that.

445
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:03,490
He may say things like this but of course he had dreams before..

446
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,560
and he had a very big dream.

447
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,090
What dream?

448
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,680
Then that's good.

449
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,550
Since we have our own standpoint, how is it, if we let you manage the royal family's leisure place?

450
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,510
When you say "leisure place", do you mean PX?

451
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,630
What do you mean by PX?

452
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,500
The small retail shop in the leisure place.

453
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,660
During my army days, that was in the Loyal Club time, I was the PX soldier.

454
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,280
Didn't you say that you were from the Navy?

455
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,870
The PX inside the Navy.

456
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,090
We are.. of course, really grateful.

457
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,050
We'll put in more effort
not to waste your good intentions.

458
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,300
Anyway, I'll take out
the working zeal that I had in the army.

459
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,220
Staying loyal... to my duties.

460
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,230
Forgive me for being impolite.

461
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,570
Chaegyung, is this car really yours?

462
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,550
Pretty, right?

463
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,790
Is that right?

464
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,700
But did you get your driver's license?

465
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,350
Of course! I'm so good.

466
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,660
Yah!

467
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,460
How did you get your car to park backwards?

468
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,200
It just turned out that way.

469
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,900
Are you really thinking of driving this car?

470
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,240
Of course.

471
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,780
But isn't it that you've
never driven on the road before?

472
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,000
Didn't Shin Goon practice it with me last time?

473
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,900
Ah, forget it, ride in my car.
It's too dangerous.

474
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,680
No!

475
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,930
I want to drive there myself!

476
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,040
You girls, also want to ride in my car to get there, right?

477
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,920
Am I right?

478
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,250
Yeah. Of course.

479
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,540
That's right.

480
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,760
Okay, then drive slowly.

481
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,740
Just contact me if something happens.

482
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,880
Shin Goon, don't you want to ride in my car as well?

483
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,860
Because I'm the Crown Prince,
my life is very precious.

484
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,690
See you there.

485
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,410
Shall we go now?

486
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,570
OK, let's go.

487
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,460
Let's go.

488
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,100
Hurry! It's time already.

489
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,450
Come in quickly.

490
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,990
Hyorin, you can refuse to go if you don't want to.

491
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,270
No, I want to go.

492
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,090
I haven't had a good talk with
my friends since that incident.

493
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,420
Now, I want to live the same as other people without being pin-pointed.

494
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,160
Alright.

495
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,000
We'll do it if you want to.

496
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,750
Yah! Why aren't you driving your own car?

497
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,130
Yah! Don't you know how expensive fuel is?

498
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,850
These days I don't have money for fuel so I can't pay for the gas.

499
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,730
But then, where's Shin?

500
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,150
Hey, let's hurry up.

501
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,000
Chaegyung already left with her car.

502
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,350
Yah! Shin Chaegyung!

503
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,500
Yah! Shin Chaegyung!
You said you knew how to drive!

504
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,540
So what the heck are you doing now?!

505
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,560
I don't know!
Something's wrong with the car!

506
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,180
I think it's broken! It's broken!

507
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,070
What do you mean your car is weird?! It's a new car! A new car!

508
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,900
You're the weird one right now.

509
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,900
Don't you guys feel it?

510
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,280
Am I the only one that can feel it?

511
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,440
Chaegyung...

512
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,440
Yul Goon.

513
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,240
You still haven't left yet?

514
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,460
I'm about to leave now.

515
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,020
But... will you be able to drive there?

516
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,860
Of course!

517
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,200
There seems to be some problem with the car.

518
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,580
We'll be making a move
once we have it checked out.

519
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,850
So just leave first.

520
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,950
Hey, can't we just go with that car?

521
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,930
Me too.

522
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,320
I'm scared, Chaegyung!

523
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,550
That's right.

524
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,150
Let's save gas by leaving the car here huh?

525
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,400
So just don't drive your car.

526
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,900
Now, now, you girls...

527
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,220
You guys don't trust me?!

528
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,040
No!!

529
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,590
No.

530
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,660
No.

531
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,540
So let's make a move now.

532
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,250
Yul Goon, just leave first.

533
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,110
We're leaving, goodbye...
We're going. We're off.

534
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,720
What to do? What to do?

535
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,050
Chaegyung, it's now only 40km.

536
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,880
It's 40km?! I better drive slower! Slower!

537
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,270
Even my grandfather goes up to 60km!

538
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,420
That's right, push the accelerator.

539
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,110
There's going to be an accident if this carries on.

540
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,620
If this keeps up,
we'll get there by tomorrow morning!

541
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,640
That's enough!

542
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,760
You girls, just pay attention on reading the map.

543
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm going to throw you out if
you make too much noise again.

544
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,880
Let's listen to some music, okay?

545
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,500
Music? Okay.

546
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,930
Let's turn on the music.

547
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,270
Yah.. how do I turn this off?
Turn it off for me!

548
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,060
This is not music!

549
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,520
Yah! If this keeps up,
then there might be no food to eat!

550
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,300
That can't happen!

551
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Chaegyung, can you speed for once?
Overtake some cars up ahead.

552
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,630
Other people can overtake, isn't that so?

553
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,000
Other cars do that?

554
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,880
Okay, hold up!

555
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,510
Yah! It's not safe to overtake cars.

556
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,160
It's faster to go in a straight course.

557
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,200
Don't worry, I'll drive faster.

558
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,370
I'm going! Be careful, I'm going to speed up.

559
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,350
We're here!

560
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,650
Why are you so late?

561
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,200
I've waited for three hours.

562
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,810
Hey, it's only three hours.

563
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,910
Anyway, we've finally arrived.

564
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,750
I want to throw up.

565
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,360
Why? Throw up?

566
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,390
Oh, you came?

567
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,170
Did you wait long for me?

568
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,290
Let's go in.

569
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,300
Why are you here so late?

570
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,660
Shin Chaegyung, I want to go to the restroom.

571
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,770
Restroom?

572
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,240
I'm going to throw up.

573
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,270
Hey! You can't throw up here!

574
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,970
Go inside quickly.

575
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,950
Why are we staying separately
when we are already here?

576
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,150
It'll be more fun and lively if we stay together.

577
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,900
It's right, we'll be sharing in one room.

578
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,000
Is that so?

579
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,390
There are rooms with three beds, so just stay there if you like.

580
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,520
Then, let us share the same room too.

581
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,790
I'm more sensitive and I'm not used to staying in the same room.

582
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:10,700
What a joke.

583
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
You grind your teeth, snore and slept really well, the last time.

584
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,080
That's what I meant.

585
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,660
Stop talking bad about me.

586
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,540
It shall be very interesting to share a room.

587
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,020
Let's go.

588
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,460
Wait a sec.

589
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,930
You will be sharing a room
since you are a couple, right?

590
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,300
There's no need to ask about such things.

591
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,370
That's an of course.

592
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,480
That's right.

593
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,770
Girls, just bring me along with you.

594
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,110
I haven't stayed overnight
with you for a very long time.

595
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,750
I'll be very bored just staying alone.

596
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,160
How can you ever be alone?

597
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,450
Your husband is here for sure.

598
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,140
Now.

599
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,180
Let's go.

600
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,560
Wait, Kang Hyun... your bags.

601
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,020
What...

602
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,670
Let's go!

603
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,990
Let me.

604
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,260
I'll help you bring it up.

605
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,930
It's alright.

606
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,450
Let's go.

607
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,450
Hurry up.

608
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,900
What? Let's go.

609
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,860
I said let's go.

610
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,820
What's this?

611
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,120
It's a closet.

612
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,500
I feel a little awkward to
be sharing the same room with you.

613
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,830
Isn't it so?

614
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,210
Why must you pretend to be shy?

615
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,550
Shouldn't you be already used to it by now?

616
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,160
That's right.

617
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,440
But still, it's such a pity since I was able to come here with my friends.

618
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,100
Do you dislike sharing a room with your husband?

619
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,410
Then, you can go out and ask for another room.

620
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,500
I didn't mean it that way.

621
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:27,750
Bad things will happen if we keep sharing a room together, right?

622
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,850
Bad things?

623
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,290
Just like that time at my house.

624
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,600
And when we stayed together overnight too.

625
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,050
I don't know when you're going to be all over me.

626
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,080
If somebody hears this,
they might think I'm a pervert!

627
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,050
Well, you are an animal.

628
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,530
What?!

629
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,960
Who asked you to kiss me by force?

630
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,040
Hey, you are not at a loss either.

631
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,840
Why are you so curt now?

632
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,150
Forget it, let's change our clothes.

633
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,950
In here, together?!

634
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,460
What about it?

635
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,590
Are you still shy in front of me?

636
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,470
What's to be shy about?

637
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,170
We've already shared the same room so many times already.

638
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,260
Fine, let's just change.

639
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,230
Just try to look.

640
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,080
Okay, I'm fine with that.

641
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,200
Shin Goon, why did you close your eyes suddenly?

642
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,500
You.. don't look!

643
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,460
If you open your eyes and you see me naked, then you're a real pervert!

644
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,340
OK. I know.

645
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,160
Hey, don't open your eyes.

646
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,410
I'm only wearing my underwear.

647
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,130
Don't try to peek!

648
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,850
I'm not done yet...

649
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,100
Not done,... you...

650
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,580
How much longer will it be?

651
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,300
Hey Shin Chaegyung! Just wear your clothes on.

652
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,440
I'm opening my eyes.

653
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,200
I already made it clear
that I'm going to open my eyes.

654
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,000
Where are you looking at?

655
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,220
That smells nice.

656
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,270
Turn it over.

657
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,240
Kang In, you...

658
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,830
Aigoo! Why are you here so late?

659
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,360
There's no point in asking.

660
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,900
Oh my! Even thinking about it makes it feel very wild.

661
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,720
Chaegyung, you must've like it!

662
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:43,920
What?

663
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,780
What are you pretending about?

664
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,240
I'm going to starve.

665
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,360
Chaegyung, he's eating too little.

666
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,790
Give him some.

667
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,920
It's embarrassing.

668
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,600
What again?

669
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,150
Nothing.

670
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,770
Why aren't you eating?

671
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,680
I think it kind of smells a little..

672
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,200
Don't be too picky.

673
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,420
Didn't you like to eat lettuce wrapped rice?

674
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,430
I'll wrap it for you.

675
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,270
Open your mouth.

676
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,250
I'm not eating.

677
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,450
Eat it.

678
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,950
Forget it.

679
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,020
I said eat it!

680
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,460
Shin, you... seemed to have changed a lot, lately.

681
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,830
Which way?

682
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,920
Should I say, you became more gentle?

683
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,420
Men are still dependent on women by habit.

684
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,150
It's because of Shin Chaegyung.

685
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,350
Where are you?

686
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,350
What do you think?

687
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,330
It's worse than I imagined.

688
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,520
It's really making people speechless.

689
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,930
Fine. Let's see Yul Goon's piece.

690
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,450
No... you can't.

691
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,000
I'll show it to you next time.

692
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,570
That's not fair!

693
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,190
Let's see how well you drew.

694
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,900
No. I said you can't.

695
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,330
It's because it's my graduation project.

696
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:56,900
Let me look.

697
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,030
Aye! I told you I'll show it to you next time.

698
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,970
Is it going well?

699
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,280
So so.

700
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,500
I'm going to take pictures. Let's go.

701
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,340
I still have a lot of things to finish.

702
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,900
Okay. Fine.

703
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,200
Yul Goon, we're going to take pictures.
Do you want to come?

704
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,820
Just go.

705
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,100
I have to continue drawing my piece.

706
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,210
You guys, let's go take pictures!

707
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,480
Hey! Let's go.

708
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,980
Let's go.

709
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,480
I have to take a shower.

710
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,340
Did I bring it?

711
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,040
Is it here?

712
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,400
Hunger prevention stuff.

713
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,310
Yes, I must have left it in there.

714
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,780
What's this?

715
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,400
Yes, Hyorin.

716
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,490
Hyorin?

717
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Wait.

718
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,570
Won't that fellow throw his temper when he finds out that I ran through his bag?

719
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:02,550
My soul was almost scared out of my own body.

720
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,170
OK, Hyorin.

721
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,600
We will talk more after we meet later.

722
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,460
Yes.

723
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:16,790
Oh, my god! What do I do about that?
