00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,650
Episode 24

2
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,730
I wanted to be a person who looked good with you,

3
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,380
but it's not working out the way I wanted it to.

4
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,690
You don't look good with me.

5
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,500
You shine so much that I can't even look at you.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,820
And because of you,
I was able to know the real world.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
Congratulations on your solar conquest.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,460
What does that mean?

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,910
You were always in your own star,
but now you started to see other stars.

10
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,350
Soon the solar conquest will start.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,360
Until the day of the solar conquest. Aja!

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,480
Jeonha.

13
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,680
The criminal of the fire incident has appeared.

14
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,510
Really?

15
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:43,910
By looking at your expression, it must not be a good news, right?

16
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,340
From staying at the Palace all my life, I was given a peace like heaven.

17
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,950
So, I could not reject the Prince's request.

18
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,580
I will, for the rest of my life,
live with a regretful heart.

19
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,450
Is this all really true?

20
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,630
I'm sorry, Mama.

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,710
So where is Suh Sang Gong?

22
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,450
She's already receiving an investigation.

23
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,670
There's a lot of suspicion.

24
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,200
Shin, requesting to set the fire in the building, it doesn't make any sense.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,030
The proof of this has appeared,
what shall we do about this?

26
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,790
Of all the days I have left to live,

27
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,510
ever since my husband asked me to promise to keep the Palace safe,

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,450
it seems as though
I won’t be able to keep that promise.

29
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,500
I have to end it with this disaster.

30
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,580
I'm sorry, Umma Mama.

31
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,210
I'm speaking the truth.

32
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:14,650
If I were only to delete the phone call on the Princess' cell phone, I'd receive money... so...

33
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you really not know that person?

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,050
I really don't know that person.

35
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,080
I just made a phone conversation.

36
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,160
Go outside first for now.

37
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:42,590
To erase a phone call, it seems like someone wants to make the Prince a suspect.

38
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,990
Until now, we can only conclude that Suh Sang Gong received your request,

39
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,670
and moved to another place.

40
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,040
Did she confess herself?

41
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,730
No, we found out that after the fire,

42
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,670
that there was a stash of money in her account moved right before that incident.

43
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,190
Then, are you saying that I sent that money?

44
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:19,010
Although the money was in her hands, the last activity made in the account was you.

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,750
Isn't it very possible that it was just a fabrication?

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:36,070
Yes, but all activities made in the banks are closely watched over.

47
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,760
TaeJa Jeonha, I will ask one last question to you.

48
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,280
You may speak.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,340
From what we have found out until now, the corroborator had transferred the money from a Swiss account.

50
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,350
Do you have an account in a Swiss Bank?

51
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,740
Yes.

52
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,500
Yes, tomorrow is the summons.

53
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,240
I guess so.

54
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,840
In the end, our Prince is…

55
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,540
Mother, the truth is not something you see, it is something you believe.

56
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,900
And we all need to believe his truth.

57
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,960
Hwang-Hu, we must become stronger in these times.

58
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:33,790
Even if bad results come out, we must protect the Prince until the end.

59
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,790
I am , Mama.

60
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,170
A parent is supposed to be trusted to handle situations like these until the last hill.

61
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,790
But we weren't able to do
that for the Prince and Princess.

62
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,180
I was never able to be a true parent to the Prince.

63
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,450
I was a raging storm to him.

64
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,350
Hwang-sang King...

65
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,570
Don't they say that when it rains, the ground only becomes sturdier?

66
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:22,320
After this event, our Prince will only become one who extends to the heavens.

67
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,940
I'm so sorry, Mama.

68
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,080
I was being prepared for this.

69
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,260
Shin Goon!

70
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,380
Jeonha!

71
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,030
Father must have done this for the Palace.

72
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,540
If I were him, I would have done the same.

73
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,650
Imperial Officer.

74
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,600
Yes, Jeonha.

75
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,700
What is today's decision?

76
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:03,850
To win this fight, if you sign it, the judge will consider your case right away.

77
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,840
Is that so...

78
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,030
Could I sign that later?

79
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,420
You may do so, Jeonha.

80
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,060
Hey you crybaby, are you crying again?

81
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,210
I'm not crying.

82
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,240
Who says I'm crying.

83
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,970
You're leaving tomorrow right?

84
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm glad that it is.

85
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,690
What is?

86
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,010
I didn't think that
I would be able to handle this without you.

87
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,850
And I can't endure being summoned in front of you.

88
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,440
It's okay.

89
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,350
Nothing will happen.

90
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,350
Oy.

91
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,920
But aren't you supposed to at least say that you'll stay by my side?

92
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,790
Who wouldn't want to?

93
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:34,700
But we promised the citizens that you will
receive the punishment for our mistakes.

94
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,460
So I want to keep that promise.

95
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,280
Because I am the Crown Princess of this country.

96
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,430
Good.

97
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,740
I won't give up until they find out I'm innocent.

98
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,780
Because I am the Crown Prince of this country.

99
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,850
Will everything end tomorrow?

100
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,760
Nothing has ended yet.

101
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,300
Do you still think there's hope?

102
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,850
There's still the truth left.

103
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,740
Are you saying that I lost when I got attacked?

104
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,880
You didn't make it up once before.

105
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,260
How can you be sure of that?

106
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,260
The reason how I know is that you would never cross that line.

107
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,020
What is this?

108
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,680
I thought that you were a good person.

109
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:51,530
But, now that I think about it, the person who
loses in this fate is not me, but you.

110
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:09,220
When the crown of the Prince was taken away from
me by you, I wasn't comfortable with it.

111
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,740
If we were to switch places,
I would have done the same.

112
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,030
Is it tomorrow?

113
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,960
Are you almost done getting ready?

114
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,500
Yes, Mama.

115
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,080
Park Sang Gong.

116
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,130
Yes, Mama.

117
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,480
Are you giving this to me?

118
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,410
Thank you so very much, Hwang-Hu Mama!

119
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,130
It was made to be given to
the daughter-in-law when she comes.

120
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,810
Hwang-Hu Mama.

121
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I've been feeling bad because I wasn't able
to do anything kind for you.

122
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,780
No, I am more .

123
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,380
I have come into the Palace
through my grandfather.

124
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,030
Because I was not a Princess at first,

125
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,590
I have not received an education like the ones born with this title.

126
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,600
I wasn't able to attract people's attention.

127
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,940
To be honest, I was jealous of you.

128
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,920
When I came into the Palace as a Princess, I was quite lonely.

129
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,900
I wondered if I would do a good job of being the nation’s mother.

130
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,390
Will I not become a failure?

131
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,240
I worried about those things.

132
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:36,150
And then I started to relax
as things started to fall into place.

133
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:44,480
But, as I saw you, I reflected myself.

134
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:54,910
I lost myself to fit in the Palace, but you always kept your spirit.

135
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:07,020
If I could turn back time, I would try to be like you with courage.

136
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,490
Hwang-Hu Mama...

137
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:20,470
Sending you like this, hurts my heart, but I'm
going to believe in you to understand me.

138
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:39,120
Bingung, call me mother.

139
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,790
A mother-in-law is also a mother, right?

140
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,550
Mother.

141
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,970
Pig!

142
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,100
ChaeJoon!

143
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,400
Mom! dad!

144
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,780
Eat slowly!

145
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,350
Hey pig, aren't you going to give it to your husband?

146
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,030
Do you think you can trick him to eat it if you wanted to?

147
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,510
He can’t eat it because he never ate it before.

148
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,900
Then what about Pig?

149
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,690
Have you seen our Princess
bring something like that?

150
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,810
Because it isn’t here she can’t eat it.

151
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,830
I told you to not be like that outside.

152
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,940
You're always like this.

153
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't cry.

154
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,250
And take care of your health.

155
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,290
And drive safely.

156
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,240
And don't worry about me.

157
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,880
Even if you drop me at a desert,
I'll be living in an oasis.

158
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,470
Our daughter is almost an adult, knowing how
to show concern for your parents first.

159
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,340
Our family has increased.

160
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,660
At first I was shy, but now I'm used to it.

161
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,940
At first, sending our Princess to the Palace
was so-so, but now I'm relieved.

162
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,610
At first I was tired and lonely,
but now I like this place.

163
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,630
I'm going to go to a wider world
with the things I have learned here.

164
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,990
Yes, whose daughter are you?

165
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,090
Do everything you haven't done in the Palace.

166
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,940
Go and come back safely, sister.

167
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,930
Hey! Shin ChaeJoon!

168
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,550
How come you don't call me "pig" anymore?

169
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,940
Why are you calling me "noona"?

170
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,610
I'm a high school student, too.

171
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,270
Do you think I’m a small kid?

172
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,680
We must not look back at the Prince's stuff.

173
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Yes, I won't do that.

174
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,010
It must be more elegant, more luxurious,
and more standing out.

175
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,790
Yes.

176
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,800
Yul, come here and look.

177
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,220
Do you like it?

178
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,720
What's wrong?

179
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:43,390
Why did you break up with someone you liked?

180
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,950
Why are you curious about that?

181
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,050
Because I want to hear it.

182
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,780
What's wrong with you?

183
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,770
I feel for my father.

184
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,820
What?

185
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,320
I thought you wanted to achieve the dream your husband wasn't able to accomplish.

186
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,520
But within that,
there was a lie hidden within one woman.

187
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,830
Yul.

188
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,840
You have deceived my father and me to get what you desired.

189
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,690
Why did it have to be the King?

190
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,450
Yul, it's not like that...

191
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,130
Karma will come around again.

192
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,870
Now, I know.

193
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,000
The reason why I couldn't love Chaegyung,

194
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,850
and why I couldn't have her,

195
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,170
was all planned.

196
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,150
Why am I always so sad?

197
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,410
Why am I always so messed up?

198
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,120
WHY!?

199
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,220
Shin Goon!

200
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,400
You being like that seems like you’re getting farther away from me.

201
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:55,060
If I go near you, I might not let you go.

202
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:03,270
I might make you forever stay here and wait for me.

203
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,800
Our paths are different now.

204
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,980
Shin Goon, come back and protect the Prince spot.

205
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,320
I told you before, right?

206
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,630
You look better being a Prince than anyone else.

207
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,230
I'm going to be the world's most coolest person ever.

208
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:47,120
Shin Chaegyung outshined everyone that
I have met before.

209
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:57,140
Shin Goon was the most loneliest
person I have ever met.

210
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,820
I must remember the Shin Goon today.

211
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,730
Why?

212
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,700
Because this is the real Shin Goon...

213
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:26,630
Warm, honest, innocent.

214
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:42,120
The meeting is beautiful as a flower,
the farewell will once again bring back the flower.

215
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:52,920
While shining radiance is like a dream,
the cries of a baby continue on forever.

216
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,530
You think you're all that for being a Prince!?

217
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,150
Do you think I'm you servant?

218
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,890
I'm a Princess at my home too!

219
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,400
Sorry!

220
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,560
I'll wipe it for you.

221
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,400
I told you to stop!

222
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,330
Throw this away.

223
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,170
Were you eavesdropping
on our conversation?

224
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,850
stop there!

225
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,150
P.E. Clothes!

226
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,280
You’re not stopping?

227
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,800
We will be outside first.

228
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,260
Gong Nae Gwan.

229
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,100
Yes.

230
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,680
Do you think I can request a favor?

231
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,030
Yes, Jeonha.

232
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,070
I may not return for a long time.

233
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,080
I want to hand over
my father for you to take care of.

234
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:17,480
Like you have been the sky for me,
please be the heaven for him

235
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,560
Everything is perfect.

236
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,970
Please.

237
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,710
Aren't you scared of going to a foreign country?

238
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,320
Since I made this decision,
I'm going to go with power.

239
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,030
You're so Shin Chaegyung-like.

240
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,540
All I wanted to do was
to make you laugh and protect you.

241
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,120
But in the end, it's become
like this because of my greed.

242
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:03,290
I'm going to take 3 most valuable items
with me and leave.

243
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,020
Love, friendship, and family.

244
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,240
I won't forget our friendship, and I'll store it.

245
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,540
Next time...

246
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:32,880
In the next world, if you meet me before Shin, then will you look towards me?

247
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,390
We will become adults.

248
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,640
Then we will have thoughts of
looking good with adults.

249
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,180
Shin Goon!

250
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,110
Shin Goon!

251
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,730
Shin Goon!

252
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,770
Shin Goon!

253
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,330
Shin Goon!

254
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,560
Shin Goon!

255
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,690
Shin Goon!

256
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,800
Bingung!

257
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,320
I'm sorry.

258
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,900
Grandma will not let go like this.

259
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,600
Please believe in me.

260
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,940
Live healthily.

261
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,870
I don’t know if I can do this.

262
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,860
I will miss you.

263
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,580
I will miss you.

264
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,120
Dae Goon Mama.

265
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,250
Are you sure you want to carry on with this press conference?

266
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,110
If I don't tell the truth,

267
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,740
There will be endless blows to the royal family.

268
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,580
Someone should stand up and end all these.

269
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,110
I want to reveal the truth today.

270
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,280
Maybe this maybe hugely affect the reputation and rules of the royal family.

271
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,940
But please don't criticize
the royal family because of me.

272
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,560
This fire incident,
do you have something to do with it?

273
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,880
What is the motive of the fire?

274
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,900
Recently, all reports of Crown Prince Lee Shin being the suspect of the fire starter,

275
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,480
It is all caused by me, Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

276
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,050
Framing the Crown Prince so as to overthrow him.

277
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,780
That is my motive.

278
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:37,480
Then, you did this alone? No accomplices?

279
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,680
I did this alone.

280
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,830
If you answer the next question,
I will be very thankful.

281
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,050
Please ask.

282
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,430
There was a time where there were scandal of you and Bingung Mama...

283
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:54,070
Being the original fiancé, how do you feel?

284
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,620
In the world,
if there is a marriage fate that can be held on to,

285
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,780
then there will also be marriage fate
that should be released.

286
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,640
Also...

287
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,130
It was a meaningless marriage fate from the start.

288
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,690
Bingung Mama and I,

289
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,100
I feel that we belong to the last category.

290
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,630
Where is the art's department?

291
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,310
Art's department is at the side building 2nd floor.

292
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,900
Question.

293
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,470
What is your motive of telling the truth?

294
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,090
How is your mood after revealing the truth?

295
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,730
You really did it by yourself?

296
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,590
Please state your motives.

297
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,860
This is it. Hwi Sung Dae Goon's press conference has hereby ended.

298
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,360
Mama.

299
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,910
Please comment.

300
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,220
Please give some brief comments.

301
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,570
Tae-Hu Mama.

302
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,250
Joong-ah.

303
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,220
Take a good look here.

304
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,350
The house without an owner, how pitiful it is.

305
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Tae-Hu Mama.

306
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,820
Something big happened.

307
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,010
Big?

308
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,420
Hello.

309
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,170
What?

310
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,360
Now our Crown Prince is clear of all crimes.

311
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,840
Peace has also come to the royal family.

312
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,730
During this period, it has been hard on everyone who has been living in fear.

313
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,800
To think back...

314
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,770
Whatever sadness and
tragedy that had happened...

315
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,570
Started because of me.

316
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,640
So...

317
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,510
I feel that it is time to take responsibility
of what happened.

318
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,560
From now, I stepped down as king.

319
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,460
I think it fits the current situation.

320
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,650
King, how can you say that?

321
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,260
Please allow that, Umma Mama.

322
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,190
I made this decision after reflecting on
my actions and a lot of thinking.

323
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,780
Since I am not worthy...

324
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,800
I should empty my position.

325
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,610
If I can live healthy, I hope to read up more
and contribute more to the people.

326
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
Are you that tired?

327
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,820
Penya.

328
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,840
Father.

329
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,280
I have a lot of things to say to the Crown Prince but...

330
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,640
I don't know how to start.

331
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,860
TaeJa.

332
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,630
I hope that you can take over the position and become a wise king.

333
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,370
I didn’t trust you and now I have
no right to tell you advices.

334
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,750
Wait till your heart feels better...

335
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:05,290
Hope that you will forgive me, your father...

336
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,580
Now you already believe me.

337
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,870
This is already enough.

338
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,970
But...

339
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,440
Before my heart decides,
I have one thing to say...

340
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,940
Congratulations on your rebirth, Hye Jong ssi.

341
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,830
I am afraid you might leave me alone in this world.

342
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,760
Thank you for coming back.

343
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,420
I did a lot of wrong doings.

344
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,440
Can mother be salvaged?

345
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,860
I'm sorry, my son...

346
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,810
Can't return here anymore right?

347
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,300
Didn’t we live very well outside the Palace?

348
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,390
The heaven is looking down upon us.
We can still live on right?

349
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,980
Even though it hurts but I am happy.

350
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,790
I am contented.

351
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,980
Auntie!

352
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,100
Hi! Hi!

353
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,330
Like it?

354
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,130
This is the 10th one already, look at how many you've got?

355
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,570
A lot. OK? OK?

356
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,330
I am asking you, OK?

357
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,800
If it was me I would have meet him already.

358
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,890
Auntie, give me this for service.

359
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,450
Hi! Hi!

360
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,690
Antonio, Hi! Hi!

361
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,690
Sister, I came back.

362
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,010
I bought pies...
where is Unni?

363
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,580
Unni, are you in here?

364
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,740
You came back, Mama.

365
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,780
I thought you went to some other places.

366
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,460
I bought egg tarts from Peter’s shop.

367
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,490
Hurry and eat while it is hot.

368
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,890
To get the master degree, I need to read lots of books and do lots of work.

369
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,320
Mama, you have to work hard.

370
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,210
I know.

371
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,750
But sister...

372
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,530
Yes Mama.

373
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,880
Changing your hair style. How about that?

374
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,700
You should wear pretty clothes and dress yourself up. You will become prettier.

375
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,050
Your hair. How come it is all tied up together?

376
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,050
Mama.

377
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,240
Cannot, Unni come with me.

378
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,730
Let's try this on...

379
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,560
Mama.

380
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,220
Why do you keep calling me Auntie"Mama ya~... Mama Mama"...?

381
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,200
-Look at this waist!
-Mama... Mama.

382
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,000
-The hair should be a bit more loosen.
-Mama.

383
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,380
Yes.

384
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:08,090
Mama. One of the Palace rules states that Sang Gong cannot be materialistic.

385
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,610
If you continue to say this I will disappear.

386
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,890
Sexy!

387
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,600
I see Shin!

388
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,560
What is this?

389
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,460
Try to eat it.

390
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,720
How have you been?

391
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,960
Father and Mother have returnedAuntie to live in the countryside.

392
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,030
What about Gongju Mama? No, I mean the Queen. How is she?

393
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,160
She feels tortured but Auntieshe is doing her duties well enough.

394
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,460
I feel that I did the right thing by giving the crown to my sister.

395
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,910
Right. Yul Goon sent me a letter.

396
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,870
It seems like he is living well with Tae-Hu Mama.

397
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,020
Did you all meet after that?

398
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:25,290
But the atmosphere here is a bit different.

399
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,350
Right? Macau is a place where Auntiethe east meets with the west,

400
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,040
Two cultures existing together.

401
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,250
The buildings are of western style.

402
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,180
But there is the trace of eastern culture
everywhere, I really came to the right place.

403
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,140
Compared to the Palace, Auntieyou are really more suitable here.

404
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,980
Really?

405
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,570
What...

406
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,410
But what is this, Auntieyou are reading it so seriously.

407
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,130
If I use this to study, I can do better work.

408
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,400
Really. Look at this!

409
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,190
Bringing your dreams, you can achieve them.

410
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,310
Cool right?

411
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:26,480
Writing down the dreams as a log, the book
acts like a form of guidance to achieve my dreams.

412
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,080
You don't even do the homework Auntiethe Palace gives you.

413
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,270
Why do you want think of learning now?

414
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,300
Why do you say that?

415
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,910
Learning another country’s culture,Auntie it is a very interesting thing.

416
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,380
Understanding the culture and traditions.

417
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,290
It is the fastest way to understand
the spirit of a country.

418
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,910
Next time, I want to go Spain.

419
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,140
Spain?

420
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:50,170
Spain is a place where Christian culture and Islamic culture cross.

421
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,410
You will keep traveling around the world?

422
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,610
If it is possible, I will.

423
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,400
I still want to learn more about design.

424
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,540
He is my boyfriend.

425
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,600
What? Boyfriend? You... really..

426
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,020
Shin Goon?

427
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,410
Oh Shin Goon! I know you very well.

428
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,770
I know you very well. How are you?

429
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,550
OK.

430
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,380
Shin Goon.

431
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,150
I'm your husband and you say that
I'm your boyfriend... What are you.....

432
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,110
Grandma!

433
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,050
Mama, Royal cannot run.

434
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,140
Then, isn't you running too now?

435
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,730
Grandma!

436
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,090
Bingung!

437
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,660
Grandma!

438
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,780
-Are you living well?
-Are you living well?

439
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,750
Yes, how about Grandma?

440
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,400
Are you living well?

441
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,020
Yes, I missed you!
Are you living well?

442
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,350
Mama, you cannot call her like that.

443
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,030
"Grandma" is incorrect.

444
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,730
It's okay, to call it here.

445
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,380
Choi Sang Gong changed too much.

446
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,590
My creation.

447
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,520
Then...

448
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,220
The international charity function, is it very tiring?

449
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,380
No, our Shin is helping me. AuntieI am doing it with ease.

450
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,470
Shin Goon?

451
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:49,130
Comparing to when he was Crown Prince, now
he participates more actively in charity functions.

452
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,890
He is no longer the Shin in the past.

453
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,510
Really? That is good.

454
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:03,760
If one places himself number one in his
heart then he can only see himself.

455
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,220
But...

456
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:12,460
By stepping back, Auntiewhat you see is not yourself but others.

457
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:18,590
People learn and grow until they die.

458
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:29,150
Grandma is tired.
I'm going in... want to rest early...

459
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,500
Well then...

460
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,300
You are really more suitable
living outside the Palace.

461
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,940
It looks like that?

462
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,770
Also, I don't dare to imagine myself as a Crown Princess.

463
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,220
Like now... to be free,

464
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,820
to feel, to breathe...

465
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,830
Living a real life...

466
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,840
How long more do you want to live like this?

467
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,630
Just...

468
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,220
I don’t want to think of other things now.

469
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:45,570
If it is possible
, I want to live without limitations.

470
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:50,040
If it is not now,
I might not have any chance in the future.

471
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,760
Then the heart that wants to be with me...

472
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,620
No longer has any standing position anymore.

473
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,570
Comparing to me,
your dreams are more precious...

474
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,600
Ugh, fool!

475
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,530
I don’t mean it that way.

476
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,170
How come you still haven’t change a bit?

477
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,850
Let's go. It's late.

478
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,300
I will get scolded by Choi Sang Gong.

479
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,440
Though it is the agreement made by two elders...

480
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,380
Allowing two strangers to get married,
I felt very uneasy.

481
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,730
However, now,
seeing that both of you are so close...

482
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:04,200
Grandma is also happy.

483
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,960
I don’t really know, Halma Mama.

484
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:15,280
Will Chaegyung love me, who is now no longer the Crown Prince?

485
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,540
I have no confidence.

486
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,600
What are you saying? It is not like Shin.

487
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,990
Look at Bingung’s eyes.

488
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,010
Grandma already knew.

489
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,360
How much Bingung likes our Shin.

490
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,760
Accept this.

491
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,330
What is this?

492
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,870
The late king...

493
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,260
gave this to me as a token of his love.

494
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,880
I thought I will give this to the both of you,
when both of your feelings are real.

495
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,600
Now it is the time to do so.

496
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,840
Believe in yourself, trust the other party.

497
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:15,630
Amongst the thousands of western phrases,
there is a saying “the brave gets the beauty”

498
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,890
What is this?

499
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,400
Let's get married for real.

500
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,170
What?

501
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,740
Get married for real?

502
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,700
Not following the agreement made by the elders...

503
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,150
To the woman I want to spend
the rest of my life with,

504
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,830
I give all my heart to propose...

505
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,500
Give me some time to think.

506
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,710
I am leaving tomorrow.

507
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,110
Why are you here?

508
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,230
To send you off.

509
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,470
Shin Goon.

510
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,050
Before you leave, untie this for me.

511
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:10,840
Maybe it is tangled together.
I can't untie it.

512
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:17,880
Sorry I feel so stuffy. Hurry...

513
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,910
I will also feel bored without Shin Goon too.

514
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,010
Pretty, right?

515
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,830
Yes.

516
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,390
Wait.

517
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,480
Please take this.

518
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,890
You should also get married.

519
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,780
Are you not feeling well?

520
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,670
Is it...

521
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,750
Baby?
