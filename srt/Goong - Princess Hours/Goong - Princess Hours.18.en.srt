Episode 18

2
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Should I just go out now?

3
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,050
But if I go out now, I would look so weird.

4
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,200
Didn't see it.. didn't see it...

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,450
I didn't see anything. I must forget it...

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,230
Why can't you go in quickly since you want to shower?
Why are you still wasting your time? Rascal..

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,110
I have to go out.
No matter what, I have to go out.

8
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,030
No way!

9
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,030
If I go out now, we will be embarrassed with each other our whole life.

10
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,780
I get cramps all over...

11
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,450
It's me...

12
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,870
Shin Goon, it's me...

13
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,110
Who... who are you?

14
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,670
I said it's me, I am Shin Chaegyung...

15
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,840
I feel so numb.

16
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,150
I say...Shin goon...
TaeJa Jeonha~~!

17
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,250
I was almost scared to death by you.
What were you doing hiding in there!?!

18
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,930
I was crammed in there for a while.
And now I have cramps all over.

19
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,070
Wait, Shin goon...

20
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,800
Are you now... no panty, right?

21
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,860
You didn't...

22
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,570
Don't tell me, you...

23
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,670
You didn't see anything right?

24
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,980
No! I was just joking. Joking!
What can I see from you?

25
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,670
You're still scared that I might've seen something? How can this be possible? You..

26
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,540
I didn't see anything strange.

27
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,640
Ahhhhh~ What am I gonna do...

28
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,810
Wow~ It's actually nice to have a royal friend.

29
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,060
We can actually come to a place like this.

30
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,480
That's right! This is all thanks to Bingung Mama Shin Chaegyung.

31
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,140
Hey, take that hat away.

32
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
That kind of style is not in fashion now.

33
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,350
It's not interesting..

34
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,350
Kang Hyun, lend me your glasses.
Knowledgeable girls are in fashion nowadays.

35
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,650
Hey, are you going to become knowledgeable just by wearing glasses?

36
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,960
- Give me my glasses back.
- No~

37
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,800
What are you guys doing here?

38
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,350
Are you ducks trying to become swans in the spa?

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,080
Can you guys watch what you are saying?

40
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,710
You guys spend money getting tutors, how come your manners are so bad?

41
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,700
You are...?

42
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,380
What's wrong?

43
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,870
How can a player like me
not notice a swan like her?

44
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,160
Swan...

45
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,700
Are you crazy???

46
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,250
You said she became a swan, then have we turned into swans as well?

47
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
She has the blood of a swan flowing in her!

48
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,380
Is this an ice cream?

49
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,000
This?

50
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,700
Whenever I come to such places in the past.
Me, Kang Hyun, Hee Soong and Soon Young...

51
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,410
We would drink beer on the sly, tell ghost stories,

52
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,650
and we would chat and paint ugly each other's face before we sleep.

53
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,040
But I'm sharing the same room with you, the world most boring and lame person.

54
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,700
What?

55
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,380
Lame?

56
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,430
Then why don't you go to your friends right now?

57
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,970
I won't stop you.

58
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,320
Hurry up just go!

59
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,340
Go~ I don't want to stay with a peeping tom like you. It scares me.

60
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,690
What... peeping tom?

61
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,390
That's right, peeping tom.

62
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,550
Besides, sneaking in when someone is showering.

63
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,380
And also, you...

64
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,200
Are you sure you didn't see?

65
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,300
See what? I didn't see anything. It was a joke.

66
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,530
You were only joking??

67
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,350
That's right.
How can a big guy like you be so petty?

68
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,350
A married couple can actually see those kinds of stuffs between them as well.

69
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,000
You... you did see. You saw right??

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,700
No~ I didn't! Your panties..
Let go... it's hot!

71
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm going to take an afternoon nap.

72
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,000
Thanks for inviting me.

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,030
Aren't we friends?

74
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:55,580
I was hesitant to come cause everyone else might be uncomfortable because of me.

75
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,440
That's all I could think about.

76
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,610
You were really tired weren't you?

77
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,000
I think I am tired of this that I might as well give up.

78
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,750
So I might struggle everyday and regret it.

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,830
But... I think I am doing the right thing.

80
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,050
I can tell that Shin likes Chaegyung a lot.

81
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,410
People say that love moves on.

82
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,450
Yul~ speaking about love…

83
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,300
Doesn't it need two people
to manage it up together?

84
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,250
Are you okay?

85
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,050
Yes, I'm okay.

86
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,050
The TaeJa's big wedding...

87
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,890
The returning of Hye Jung Jong
and Hwi Sung Dae Goon...

88
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,820
The royal family have
become more lively than before.

89
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,060
My deepest apologies, Mama.

90
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:42,080
Now, it's the time that TaeJa and Hwi Sung Dae Goon to increase the number of people of the royal family, right?

91
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,830
Although the common people are only giving birth to one or two. But that their own personal business,

92
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,210
and it has nothing to do with the royal family, right?

93
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,880
That's right.

94
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,540
From the past till now, the members of the Royal family has lesser descendants.

95
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,700
And that means that our end is drawing near.

96
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,000
That will be the strength of the royal family if we have lots of descendants.

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Queen and Hye Jung Jong, you must remember this in your hearts.

98
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,550
I'll keep it in heart, TaeHwangTaeHu Mama.

99
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,450
Speaking of it. From what I see now.

100
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,180
Our Bingung and Hwi Sung Dae Goon seem to be really close.

101
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,480
Didn't the two of them just get to know each other for not long?

102
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,340
Although they haven't known each other for long,
but since...

103
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,120
Bingung and Hwi Sung Dae Goon are classmates, it's natural they are close.

104
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,330
Is that so?

105
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,850
So that's why they seem so friendly to each other.

106
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,540
When Hwi Sung Goon just return to our country.

107
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,850
Bingung Mama gave him lots of help. That's why they are so close.

108
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,450
No wonder, they seem to have lots of understanding for each other.

109
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,580
But then, both of them are far too close.

110
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,850
So won't the Prince get jealous?

111
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,310
Mama. Although the Prince is still young, his heart is really open.

112
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right, I was only saying for fun.

113
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,550
Anyway the royal family is so harmonious.
There's nothing even better than this, isn't that right?

114
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Please eat.

115
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,270
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

116
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,840
It's been a long time, Tae-Hu Mama.

117
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,390
You've been fine these days too.

118
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,730
You can go now.

119
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,550
Yes, Mama.

120
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,770
Speaking of it... Internal Officer...

121
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,000
When Crown Prince Hyo Ryul was still alive, you were the person that was waiting on Hwi Sung Goon, right?

122
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,370
But now, you have pledged your loyalty to the Prince.

123
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,550
So what exactly are the standards of
the Internal Officer's loyalty based on?

124
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,380
The duties of an Internal officer is not
to wait on the person but the position.

125
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
After the death of Crown Prince Hyo Ryul.

126
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,350
My heavens have been changed.

127
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:39,000
Now I can only pledge
my full loyalty to Crown Prince.

128
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,070
Is that so?

129
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,630
So let's say...

130
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,330
If the Crown Prince was changed
to Hwi Sung Dae Goon...

131
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,010
You will be waiting on Hwi Sung Dae Goon again?

132
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,650
I was just speaking casually. Well then...

133
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,440
Then, I have some words that I don't know if I should tell you, Mama.

134
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,120
Just say it.

135
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,590
Lately, Hwi Sung Goon Mama...

136
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,680
Seems to have been going in and out
the Myung Seon Dang quite often.

137
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,350
Maybe Hwi Sung Goon Mama got to
know about that incident, right?

138
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,920
What? Yul?

139
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,550
That's impossible for sure.

140
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,700
That's what I wish for, too.

141
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,390
It's still best that the juniors don't
know about the seniors' entangled fate.

142
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,700
Then, I'll be taking my leave first.

143
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,340
You! How can you be saying those words?!

144
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,310
I was only speaking the truth.

145
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,300
Compared to the Crown Prince, Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama has more potential that's suitable to be the king.

146
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,380
Are these the words that should come out of the royal relative's mouth,

147
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,090
who have pledged to
stay loyal to the royal family?

148
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,050
Senior..

149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,550
Didn't you also witness personally the
things that happened around the Crown Prince?

150
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,430
He's now bringing shame to the royal family.

151
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,110
The Royal relatives are now very disappointed towards the Crown Prince.

152
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,440
We have now begun to shift our hopes on Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama.

153
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,550
It's not that Hwi Sung Dae Goon doesn't match with the traditions.

154
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,450
Isn't he also the son of the mourned king?

155
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,570
Have the Crown Prince couple and Hwi Sung Goon all safely arrived?

156
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,090
From I heard, yes.

157
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,850
Is that so?

158
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,420
I feel really bad because I didn't help him prepare his birthday in the Palace.

159
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,450
Fortunately, the Crown Prince couple will be accompanying him for it. That's a relief.

160
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,450
Pyeha.

161
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,450
There are lots of rumors flying around outside the Palace now.

162
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,010
Tell me, please.

163
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,350
My deepest apologies, Mama.

164
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,450
The position of Hwi Sung Dae Goon in the citizens' hearts have been on the rise.

165
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,800
They are even leaning towards the idea of getting Hwi
Sung Dae Goon to take over the Crown Prince's place.

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,340
Looking from the incidents that happened
around the Prince during this period of time.

167
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,970
It's not surprising that such
a thing would even happen.

168
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,600
Pyeha, it doesn't seem too right to keep quiet about everything.

169
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,660
The soundless debate is the most frightening of all.

170
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,480
Internal Officer.

171
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,850
Yes, Pyeha.

172
00:15:51,850 --> 00:16:01,450
To be honest, I, too, feel that Hwi Sung Dae Goon is more suitable than the Prince to be the King.

173
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,580
Pyeha.

174
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,700
How can you be saying such things?

175
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,750
You can't never ever think of it that way.

176
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,570
I know.

177
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,550
But, I have been having such thoughts often, lately.

178
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,080
Mama, Baek Chun ha has requested to meet you.

179
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,550
Ask him to come in.

180
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,410
You requested to see me?

181
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,970
Please sit.

182
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,350
From now onwards...
I may be needing your help.

183
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,450
Help me find a person secretly.

184
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,700
But... you must not leave a trail behind.

185
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,210
I understand.

186
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:51,650
Here, a nice hair style. Shin Goon..
Your lips are really thick.

187
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,740
What the...

188
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,450
Wow he has thick lips.
Am I pretty?

189
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,880
Mirror, mirror... who is the
prettiest girl in the world? Hee soon~

190
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,720
She's crazy... Crazy...

191
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,700
Well... about that...

192
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,450
Hey~ Where do you live? I live in Kang Nam.

193
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,420
I live in Kang Book. It only takes one
hour to go to Kang Nam if I take the subway.

194
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,700
Ah, do you know who my dad is?

195
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,230
Hyung, what are you doing?
He's looking for you.

196
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,580
Why?!

197
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,450
Okay, tell him I'll be right there.

198
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,350
Then, bye.

199
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,430
Bye~

200
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,590
Get your head straight. Get a hold on yourself. Steady.. Steady..

201
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,700
Shin Goon!

202
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,450
Shin Goon!

203
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,250
Where did he go?

204
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Should I have just gone out
when he told me too?

205
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,700
I came all the way here and it's so boring to play with Shin Goon.

206
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,490
Ah, that's right.

207
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,650
What are we watching?

208
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,780
Lets just watch something that's on TV.

209
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,350
Just be quiet.

210
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,310
Bingung Mama will show us a funny romance royal family film that she took of Shin.

211
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,850
Funny, what funny... you're funnier!

212
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,700
Here, just watch.

213
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
Yay, it's coming out.

214
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,380
Who filmed it?

215
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,310
What happened?

216
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,490
I thought you filmed it.
How come you're in it?

217
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,550
Don't know...

218
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,090
Yah! Hey, that camcorder!!!

219
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,930
Ahhhhh~

220
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,130
Why are you showing that video to all of us?

221
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,590
Hwang TaeJa couples love story.
We watched it well.

222
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,700
Hey! Hey hey hey! It's nothing like that.
Don't misunderstand. It's not like that.

223
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,750
Hey~ Chaegyung.

224
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,650
Why did he film that?

225
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,000
Is he a pervert?

226
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,340
Or is he trying to tease me?

227
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,380
Aw, the girls were all there.

228
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,780
Ah~ so embarrassing!

229
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,490
Should I watch it again?

230
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
Wait! Kim Sang Gong.

231
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,300
Hi. How are you?

232
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,190
Well if you have any questions, just ask me.

233
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,000
Please take care.

234
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,080
This way...  Try this. I tried it and it's great.

235
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,380
Hello.

236
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,340
Please eat slowly.

237
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,650
Just to let you know, the persimmon was grown personally by me.

238
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,650
Please enjoy it.

239
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,450
Yes.

240
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,700
So how's the job? Can you handle it?

241
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,230
Who do you think I am??

242
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,700
I can do anything.
Housework, working at the leisure room...

243
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,350
All the problems will be
solved when I put out my hand.

244
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,490
Anyway what are you doing?

245
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,380
I came here to pull in more clients.

246
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,450
You are hunting down the whole Palace.

247
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,590
Madam Lee. I think there is no one left in the Palace to ask to have insurance.

248
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,850
What do you mean?

249
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,750
Who can find a bigger gold mine than here?
Let the person stand out.

250
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,250
The Palace is crowded with people.

251
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,000
When there are people there is insurance.
Where there is insurance, there are people.

252
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,470
You are amazing.

253
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,500
So who is it today?

254
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,890
Today's target. Choi Sang Gong.

255
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,750
Ah~ Choi Sang Gong!

256
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,750
That iron chicken, Choi Sang Gong,
Singles usually don't take insurance.

257
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,450
What do you mean?

258
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,290
Singles are more dangerous so they need it.

259
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,550
So if I get her to take, I will have a
celebration party for you for getting a job.

260
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,150
A celebration party? Really?

261
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,320
Yes.

262
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,450
On a day like this,
we need our Princess Chaegyung.

263
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,610
Why? Where is she?

264
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,740
She went to Hwi Sung Dae Goon's birthday party.

265
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:41,140
I bet I am the only dad in the world who got a
job in the Palace to see his daughter. Don't you think?

266
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,010
I think I love my daughter too much.

267
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,150
Aigoo~

268
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,170
That's because you have
the same age mentality as her.

269
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,590
Well I'm going to work.

270
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,250
You worked hard.

271
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,190
It tastes not bad, right?

272
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,000
So here... you are single right now but...

273
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,350
When you get married in the future and have kids...

274
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,450
You don't know what will happen.
So you need to have an insurance now.

275
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,580
We, the Palace maids aren't allowed to get married.

276
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
What..?

277
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,510
A pretty lady like you can't marry?

278
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,450
That's impossible.

279
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,250
Palace maids can't get married?

280
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,680
No way! That's not fair. It's not
even the olden times. That's impossible!

281
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,130
I was born in a poor family and I grew up in a poor environment.

282
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,560
Yes?

283
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,390
Luckily, Hwang-Hu Mama supported for my
tuitions and I was able to finish university.

284
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,120
To pay back for Hwang-Hu Mama's kindness, I came into the Palace.

285
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,450
So not being able to marry is not a problem for me.

286
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,530
What do you mean?

287
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,650
What's the interesting part of life?

288
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,710
That's to marry someone that you love, have fights and give birth to nasty..

289
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,550
Well.. you have kids and live together..

290
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,550
Do you think it's fair that you can't marry?

291
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,980
It was my choice.

292
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,720
But what I am trying to say is...

293
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,960
In such a fast pace modern society generation,

294
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,000
why can't they let you marry?

295
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,450
This is just...

296
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,850
It's an exploitation of the labor force.

297
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,900
And also, what's it? Right...
Trampling on human rights.

298
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,450
This is also the inferior thinking
of the women's modern day principle.

299
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,380
It's a forced submission.

300
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,350
But many of elders in
the Palace aren't married too.

301
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
No! The place that our Chaegyung have to spend her whole life.

302
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,200
I can't just sit here and see that my daughter lives in a place where people can't marry.

303
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,520
I will go complain and solve this problem.

304
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,380
Just believe me and
I will get you married for sure.

305
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,970
But that's not it...

306
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,810
Just trust me. I'm going.

307
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,260
What do you think of this??

308
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:28,050
Forbidding a young lady from marrying is such an unfair thing in our country.

309
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,440
I think you should drink some tea.

310
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, where was I?
Why does my throat hurt so much?

311
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,050
Well you were talking for 30 minutes.

312
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,650
Anyways, don't you think I'm right?

313
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,250
Well, I have felt many things after you told us this.

314
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,190
But it has been a tradition for many years that I haven't thought of that.

315
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,040
Isn't that right, Hwang-Hu?

316
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,860
Yes, I should have reorganized the rules myself.
I'm sorry.

317
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,450
No, it's okay.

318
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,550
Now that we have heard what others think, we can discuss what to do from now on.

319
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,550
Are you feeling better now?

320
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,550
I feel much better now, yes.
Thank you for listening to me.

321
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,150
How come I was so high?

322
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:51,310
Well you were talking about
the rules that you didn't like...

323
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,730
Yul, happy birthday!

324
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,870
Thanks!

325
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,530
Happy birthday.

326
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,700
You need to do cheers, too.

327
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,680
Doesn't it feel like we've become celebrities?

328
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,350
Yeah, I know.

329
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,850
You are very creative.
How did you think of getting masks?

330
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,190
Just for everyone else to have fun.

331
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,330
But, where did she go?

332
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,550
Since it's a birthday, you need a cake.

333
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,950
What're you waiting for Yul Goon, hurry and blow.

334
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,620
Go ahead and blow the candles.

335
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,800
Cheers!

336
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,410
Cheers!
Happy birthday!

337
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,810
I want today to be a fun day.

338
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:35,650
My birthday is just an excuse, I've always wanted to spend time with my friends like this.

339
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,230
When I lived in England,
I didn't have much friends,

340
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,830
Now, you have us.
Right, Shin Goon?

341
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,070
Right?

342
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,140
Yeah.

343
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,580
Anyways, happy birthday.

344
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,110
Thanks.

345
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,580
For being able to attend.

346
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,350
Shin, don't drink that.

347
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,820
This is peach champagne.
You're allergic to peach.

348
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,330
Is this peach?

349
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah, it is.

350
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh well.

351
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,310
Last time, Shin ate canned peach, and his body became a red carrot.

352
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:38,620
But, the funny thing is, his back had a spot, and it was always shaped like a heart.

353
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,190
It was really funny, wasn't it?

354
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,560
That spot lasted a long time.

355
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,590
It could've caused big trouble if you drank it.

356
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,570
Oh yeah, Shin, did you tell her that you're allergic to peanuts, too?

357
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,450
Huh?

358
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,470
No.

359
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,770
You can't eat peanuts too?

360
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,740
I really like peanuts too.

361
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,650
If you're not going to drink that, give it to me.

362
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,590
Yah~! Are you trying to show off?

363
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,930
Peaches? I reaaally like peaches.

364
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,100
I've been looking for you.

365
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,050
What were you doing?

366
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,160
Just here...

367
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,370
Is it because of Hyorin?

368
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,610
Hyorin knows more about Shin.

369
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,780
I don't know much about him.

370
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,190
They've met for 2 years, but I heard that they were very close.

371
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,960
Two years, isn't a short amount of time.

372
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,500
That's true, but I still feel bad.

373
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,040
I know nothing about Shin...

374
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,910
Will time take care of it?

375
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,580
Time doesn't take care of everything.

376
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:15,910
They said that they will sponsor me, but the truth is that they want me to leave Korea.

377
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,040
Don't worry about it.

378
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,450
Even if it's the royal family, they don't have the right to interfere with my life.

379
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,280
No.

380
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,420
Honestly, I have been calmly thinking about it.

381
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,190
I don't want to be a burden to teacher.

382
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,800
The sponsorship is a much deeper step in support for what I own right now.

383
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,140
And so?

384
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,940
I'm considering about it.

385
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,010
I was thinking about going outside of Korea to study, and then I thought of another thing.

386
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:03,660
Soon, you were going to major in films and I was going to study ballet.

387
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,260
At that time, you said that about 2-3 years later, you were thinking of going overseas to study.

388
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:18,670
If that were to happen, if we were to study together, then it would've been great.

389
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,770
Going alone would have been lonely.

390
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,710
I really did want to go overseas to study.

391
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:34,120
If you were to spread out your wings of dreams to study movies in Paris, you'll produce the best movies.

392
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah. After 2-3 years, going to Paris was thought to be my future.

393
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,900
I knew you were thinking that, then if...

394
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,800
But.

395
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,770
I think something more valuable than my dream has appeared in my life.

396
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,550
If I were really going to go,
I'd want to go with that person.

397
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,190
But now, I can't leave the Palace.

398
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,300
My mother's intentions are not that pure but in conclusion, I think this is better for you.

399
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,880
Go achieve your dream in Paris.

400
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,630
Did you see what Shin likes or not?

401
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,300
Shin Goon must be different than me.

402
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,400
How so?

403
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:04,040
Shin Goon already calculated the future without me.

404
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm not like that.

405
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:16,050
Thinking of Shin not being in my future,
my heart hurts.

406
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,830
But Shin isn't like that.

407
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,100
He's really different than me.

408
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,250
I told you not to trust his heart.

409
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,000
You and Shin don't match.

410
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:42,580
This makes me feel bad though,
he could've told me about studying overseas.

411
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,620
But Hyorin would be
more comfortable to him than you.

412
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,270
What is wrong with my dream?
How can it be so vivid?

413
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,870
Time has gone by just like this.

414
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,370
What's wrong, Pyeha?
Did you have a nightmare?

415
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,110
I must have woken you up.

416
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:32,620
I wasn't in deep sleep, either.
What did you dream of?

417
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,820
It's nothing.

418
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,400
It's been 20 years living with you.

419
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,830
It has been a long time.

420
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,470
During that time...

421
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,580
I have been there for you, but...

422
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,620
I guess I haven't been able
to get close to your heart.

423
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,750
What are you talking about, Hwang-Hu?

424
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:15,550
I always waited for you to empty your heart for me.

425
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
But that place was never emptied.

426
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,540
I have been waiting and waiting.

427
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:34,580
There have been things that
I could give up and couldn't.

428
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,050
I must see that my son will become the king.

429
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:53,450
That's the best life present that you can give to the me who has been suffering in silence by your side.

430
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,470
Hwang-Hu.

431
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,500
About that...

432
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,340
So...

433
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,840
Pyeha, you must protect the Prince.

434
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,250
You just definitely have to.

435
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,060
When will we be able to get together like this?

436
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,970
It would be hard...
It's going to be our graduation soon.

437
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,070
This is so unsatisfying.

438
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,810
Yeah.

439
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,110
We're already talking about graduating.

440
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,010
If we graduate,
do we become members of the society?

441
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,350
I'm afraid that we will be
wasting away our lives like now.

442
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,590
In that case,
we have to live our lives more seriously.

443
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,830
Whenever, wherever.

444
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,330
We have to live life seriously
no matter where we are.

445
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,800
Duckie, you are going to spend the rest of your life in the Palace, so how can you still be talking of living seriously?

446
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,210
I might have some freedom 2-3 years later.

447
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:13,380
How can you get free?
Do you remember who you are?

448
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,320
Anyway, I still have to think of it.

449
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,520
Then, wouldn't there be reports on you escaping from the Prince?

450
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,320
Does it make sense for a Princess to leave the Palace?

451
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,300
I could dream about a different future, too.

452
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,440
AH! THAT'S HOT!

453
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,250
Oh, Chaegyung! Are you okay?

454
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,780
Why are you so careless?

455
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,980
I'll get you some ice.

456
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,350
No, I'll go.

457
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,350
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

458
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,560
Chaegyung!

459
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,600
Are you okay?

460
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,240
Let me take a look.
Are you hurt!?

461
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,470
What to do?
Blood!

462
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,470
Are you okay?

463
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,750
I'm not the one who got hurt!
Are you okay?

464
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,910
I'm okay.

465
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,050
It's fine, as long as you're not hurt.

466
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,580
Let's go together.

467
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,880
Are you sure you
don't need to go to the hospital?

468
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,950
Yul Goon, are you dumb?

469
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,590
You already know that you're hurt.
I feel sorry.

470
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,190
It's better for me to get hurt.

471
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,370
Didn't I tell you already?
If you're hurt, I'm hurt.

472
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,380
Now that we're like this, it brings back the memories when we were playing polo.

473
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,210
At that time you came to me.

474
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,820
At that time, no one was concerned over you.

475
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:44,360
At that time, when you were running towards me, I was really happy for a moment.

476
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,610
I'm really sorry, it's all my fault.

477
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:10,750
If you're really sorry,
can you receive one present from me?

478
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,330
Present?

479
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,660
But today is your birthday.

480
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,440
There's something I really want to give you.

481
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,470
Okay.

482
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,590
Yul Goon!

483
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,250
Not as friends, I wanted to tell you something as a man to a woman.

484
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,300
Thank you for appearing and
becoming my destiny.

485
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,250
Get up.

486
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,620
I don't want to.

487
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,790
I said get up.

488
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,320
I don't want to.

489
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,130
She said she doesn't want to.

490
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,750
It's not enough for you to be hugged by another guy and now this?

491
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,700
Do you really like him that much?
Are you that concerned over Yul?

492
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,110
What are you talking about?
Who do you think Yul Goon got hurt because of?

493
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,280
To me, it looked like it was the moment you two have been waiting for.

494
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,050
Didn't he do that on purpose?

495
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,850
Stop talking nonsense.

496
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,290
Why don't just focus your attention on your great future plans?

497
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,360
What are you talking about?

498
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,170
After 2-3 years, we're going to divorce and you're going overseas to study.

499
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,940
You better start planning now.

500
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,000
Studying overseas?

501
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,450
Oh that.

502
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:26,080
Well, I don't care who you go study overseas with.

503
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:33,530
By that time, I'll be back with my family.
That's the future I want.

504
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,630
The future you want is to go back to your home?

505
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,500
Yes.

506
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,670
If you think about it, it might work out well.

507
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:51,380
You can go find your dream and I can start a new life with a guy I like.

508
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:58,650
By any chance, does your future plan of starting fresh have to with Yul?

509
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,150
What?

510
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,620
You really don't know anything but yourself.
Yul Goon and you are different.

511
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,490
At least he's honest to me.
You're not honest with me.

512
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,200
If you're not honest, we can't get any closer like we are right now.

513
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,140
What are you doing?

514
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,650
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm your husband.

515
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,590
You're such a jerk!!
