00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,300
Episode 12

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,350
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,350
When you are still on the position as Crown Prince?

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,060
2 or 3 years from now..

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,300
What?

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,780
I'm giving up my place as the Crown Prince.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,190
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,300
If I am to give up right now..

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,150
I will be thought as a teen that's being rebellious..

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,150
And so, I'll have to wait till they can take
my words seriously before I tell them.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,750
I'll make an excuse to go overseas for studies
and leave this place forever.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,450
Anyway, there's a more suitable person to be the Prince who has set his eyes on my position.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,050
In that case, you can also get to leave
this boring Palace life as well.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,700
And find back your complete freedom.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Will it be as easy as what you said?

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,080
Let's take it as because I hate to hear
your whining that you want to go home..

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,090
I'll be doing it for sure, so don't worry too much.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,070
If you patiently wait a few years, I'll send you off...

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,310
So please bear with it first and remain by my side.

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,890
Let's do it according to the Royal Laws for
the mourning of the dead King.

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,760
If uncle becomes a dead King that's being mourn...

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,080
Isn't it an "of-course" thing that his wife and son be changing their ranks as well?

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,700
Although the ranking of their titles will be ranked just below the King's position in the name list.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,430
But it doesn't mean that Yul can directly skip over the Crown Prince to become King.

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,180
Also in Uhmamama's case,

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,150
Hye Jung Gong who is about to be the Great Queen will still be her sister-in-law.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,080
And so, there won't be too big for a problem.

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,190
If Father doesn't do the mourning when you are still in position...

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,700
then are you thinking of holding it back...

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
and instructing me to do it as your last wish?

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
If you wait until I become King...

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
to do the mourning for Uncle as a King...

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,080
Then that will be too absurd.

34
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,350
Yes...

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,530
Didn't think that you'll be thinking of that so far off.

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,230
There will be no changes for
my wishes to do the mourning.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,470
I was only thinking of the possibilities of some political problems occurring.

38
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,370
And so, the ranking of the positions will not be as easy as you said.

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,370
You must think carefully.

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,970
The Goong's internal and media..

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,270
You must think over it really carefully before you make the decision.

42
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,700
Yes.

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,900
Duk Cheong of the Chosun era had also drag the mourning problem was like that for a few years.

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,200
Even Ahbamama has prepared for 14 years..

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,900
Right, that's right...

46
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,070
Good.

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,850
So for now just temporary put the mourning problem as a solo project.

48
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,150
Do it according to the procedures and wait for the National Assembly's approval.

49
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,780
Yes, Ahbamama.

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,440
It was laborious.

51
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,950
It was laborious.

52
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,450
Teacher!

53
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,430
Have you been well?

54
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,700
Yes.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,780
You always behave indifferently
and look somewhere else.

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,160
Is it true that there's only you in your solitary heart?

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,260
Is it really a waste of time to habor any hope for you?

58
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,830
Shin Goon...

59
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,490
What are you doing?

60
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,900
Whoa~ are you writing a scenario?

61
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,240
Ah... The movie department main projects are to be shown during the holidays.

62
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,970
Should we have a presentation as well?

63
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,370
Just in case...

64
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,890
If you had to choose between the two...

65
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,310
Would you want to become a movie director or would you want to become King?

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,580
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,840
Because it seems like it'll be difficult to be a movie director if you become King.

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,680
It's not that it's hard...

69
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,940
it's that you can't.

70
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,510
But my dream is to become a designer.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,510
It would be best to forget about it.

72
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,930
Way to go Korea!

73
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,130
Dreams...come true.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,590
Finish this and then continue.

75
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,720
They say that eccentric people
have to eat more chocolate.

76
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,120
To be able to travel the world like this.

77
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,150
Our HaeMyung is to be envied.

78
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,370
Although the world is round...

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,560
The world that Grandma sees is only those Bong Soon flowers under the fence.

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,350
Bong Soon flowers under the fence?

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
It means that...

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,350
the only means by which Grandma interacts with the world is through that TV.

83
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,050
How does the TV do that?

84
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,140
They say that there was once
a teacher with a square face.

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,760
One day the teacher walked into the classroom...

86
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,800
and the students started
singing a song to make fun of him.

87
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,060
"In the square classroom, there is a square desk."

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,150
"On the square shelf, there is a square book." ... there is a song like that.

89
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,810
Yes, I think I heard it too. And so?

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,590
But... even though they sang that song,

91
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,910
the teacher's expression did not waver.

92
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,210
So the students then asked
the teacher to sing a song.

93
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,720
At first, the teacher pretended
to not have heard anything,

94
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,810
but eventually
the teacher started to sing a song.

95
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,310
And then the students fell over.

96
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,320
Why was it so?

97
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,320
Well, let me see.
What song did he sing?

98
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,000
The Bong Soon flowers under the fence.

99
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,790
The Bong Soon flowers under the fence?

100
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,490
Sing it once.

101
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,330
The Bong Soon flowers under the fence, my shape...

102
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,690
My shape?

103
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,250
Square? Oh, really.

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,120
Our grandma's eyes are high.

105
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,330
Even that kind of thing comes out on TV?

106
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,310
No.

107
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,640
Crown Princess taught me it.

108
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,300
The Princess taught you the song?

109
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,410
Yes.

110
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,150
Although she has a lot of suffering getting use to the life of the Imperial Palace,

111
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,510
but because her personality is cheerful...

112
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,070
She even gives Grandma a lot of happiness.

113
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,550
How can they go ahead with the mourning?

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Like the speed of going a thousand miles in a day to get the National Assembly's approval?

115
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,440
When Hye Jung Gong is still overseas...

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,940
The National Assembly makes a yearly proposal for the mourning to be done.

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,240
It seems like there's some political power that supports Hye Jung Gong.

118
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,640
Yes, Mama.

119
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,140
When Hye Jung Gong was in England, she never stopped giving her supports.

120
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,240
To a few Assembly members as Political parties funds...

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,740
Why are you reporting only now such important news?

122
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,450
Most of the National Assembly are Uncle's old classmates.

123
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,450
So they must have got in touch with her secretly under the cover of personal relationships, Mother.

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,150
That's right, Mama.

125
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,450
Who could ever predict that she had been trying to get people over to her side?

126
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
When is Hye Jung Gong going over to the Great Queen Palace?

127
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,550
Have you come to visit the Palace?

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,560
Yes, hello.

129
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,350
Your speech have become very short during these days.

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,650
Hwang-hu Mama's case..

131
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,950
your speech seems to have become very long.

132
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,330
I remember that 14 years ago, you were more non-talkative.

133
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,910
Although I don't know your motive of returning...

134
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,550
but if you're thinking of pulling Hwi sung Goon up to the King's position..

135
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,280
It is preferable if you just say it out directly.

136
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,480
What?

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,050
If that's the case..

138
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,550
we can stop avoiding each other..

139
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,930
And compete fairly.

140
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,570
Fair play, you say?

141
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,380
I don't think that it suits what you are wearing now.

142
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,370
Although you had practiced for 14 years

143
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,570
you are still not skilled enough besides in the old way of speaking.

144
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,480
For fair play, don't we have to be of equal standings?

145
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,980
In Hwang-hu's case, you have everything while I do not...

146
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,380
and also Hwang-hu has gained many things while I have lost many.

147
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,380
So there's not going to be any possibility of fair play.

148
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,070
Oh my, who is this? HaeMyung Gongju.

149
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,710
When did you come back?

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,330
Hello, Aunt.

151
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,650
I came back some time ago.

152
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,630
Aunt, you look as attractive as before.

153
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,900
The clever and pretty Princess has already grown up so much.

154
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,260
Time really waits for no man.

155
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,550
When did you return?

156
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,530
It hasn't been long since I returned.

157
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,050
Mother...

158
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,740
Let's take it as a challenge to solve the Chu Jeon problem.

159
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,550
Although it's so...

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,280
Didn't you also see Hye Jung Gong's acted as well?

161
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,880
The Chu Jeon this time, is her jumping board to enter the palace.

162
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,190
It's only starting now.

163
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,650
What do you mean by that?

164
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,510
You must remain calm.

165
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,600
From now on, many occurences will arise within the Imperial Palace.

166
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,210
Just move along with the current.

167
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,130
If that's a justify wave, then, we can naturally get through it all.

168
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm going to...

169
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,210
stop coming to the Palace from now on.

170
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,070
And go back to England again.

171
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,090
Why are you speaking like this?

172
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,370
Return back to England?

173
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,950
Has someone made Hye Jung Hong feel uncomfortable?

174
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,260
No, Mama.

175
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,390
I thought it was strange that

176
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,070
even Hwi Sang Goon stopped visiting the Palace sometime ago.

177
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,570
Please tell me...
Who? Who did such a thing?

178
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,680
It is not so, Mama.

179
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,780
Besides Chu Jeon problem...

180
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,580
there're still other worries as well.

181
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,330
Other worries, you say?

182
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:25,570
Because of the Prince's scandal in Thailand, Mama, you must be worried over it as well.

183
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,650
What are you talking about?

184
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,370
the Prince's scandal, you say?

185
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,510
Mama, you don't know about it?

186
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,570
What are you taking me as?

187
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,460
Just because I'm always smiling,
you guys just see me an old lady without any thinking?

188
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,610
That is not so, Uhmamama.

189
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,110
It's because we are afraid that you might worried too much...

190
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,280
So you did it for me?

191
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,600
Haven't you always been like this even now?

192
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,000
I always the only one in the dark when everyone else already knows.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,900
So, aren't you treating me like a fool?

194
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,540
Mama, it is not like that.

195
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,660
What's no?

196
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,590
Although you kept saying that I am the Imperial House's highest rank senior...

197
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,890
What exactly do you see me as?

198
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,000
The same with the Chu Jeon problem this time.

199
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:24,200
It's problem that has been around for 14 years...

200
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,100
So where does much so many unhappiness come from?

201
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,220
Do you want to chase away again those people that only just return?

202
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,150
Had both of you planned it beforehand?

203
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,060
Why must you must inflict a wound again on someone that has already been hurt?

204
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,590
Yes? Mama, where did you hear it from?

205
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,070
That's enough.

206
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,580
From now on, I will not be a kindhearted old lady that's always smiling.

207
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,060
This is the official Royal family rank references according to the Chosun Era.

208
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Chu Jeon doesn't just concern one person but the whole family.

209
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,370
The bestowment of new names and ranking promotions as well.

210
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,550
On the official Royal family rank reference book...

211
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,670
As for the problems for the ranking positions to succeed the King after the Chu Jeon..

212
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,670
It has stated that we must follow the decision made by the Royal family's highest position holder.

213
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,040
For the problem about the Chu Jeon this time, I'll be making all the decisions.

214
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,080
Even though I am a weak old woman...

215
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,190
I still hold the rights to do it as I am not dead yet.

216
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,860
What is it?

217
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,810
I'm afraid that I have to report the facts to you.

218
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,630
The contents of the Thailand news...

219
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,030
I don't know where the Great Queen heard it from...

220
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,830
She's really angry because we kept her in the dark.

221
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,890
The truth that even all the elementary students know of...

222
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,290
We have been trying to cover it from the Great Queen who is in the same Imperial Palace with us.

223
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,890
Isn't that a strange thing to do?

224
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,280
Jeonha...

225
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,800
this incident is not that simple.

226
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,600
It is a problem in which involves your standing power.

227
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,650
What is it?

228
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,170
I had a lot to say...

229
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,970
but because you said "what is it"...

230
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,870
I don't know if it's right to say such things now.

231
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,880
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,720
You had a hard time because of me, right?

233
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,230
Where are you right now?

234
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,860
Then...

235
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,050
I'm leaving right now...

236
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,050
so, just wait for me at the bookstore.

237
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,530
We won't have much time to talk, so don't be late.

238
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,570
Okay, I understand.

239
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,090
I'm going out for a little.

240
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,130
Jeonha...

241
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,840
in times like this it is best to be careful.

242
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,100
I wish that the Chu Jeon will go smoothly...

243
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
and it's best that Hwi sung Goon
can become the King as well.

244
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,800
Hey, what are you talking about?

245
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,560
Honestly, the Crown Prince is too serious.

246
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,970
Look at Hwi Sung Goon Mama.

247
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,440
He's always smiling and kind-hearted as well.

248
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,740
ahh ~ he's so charming! What to do?

249
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,780
You have to stop saying that.

250
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,730
I'm not the only one saying it.

251
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,970
Look at the popularity votings.

252
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,070
Hwi Sung Goon Mama has a lot more points than the Prince

253
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,070
and Hye Jung Gong Mama should have more popularity votes than Hwang-hu Mama.

254
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,000
That's what you think.

255
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
Ah, look at her. I'm saying that it's not!

256
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,720
You look as so cold hearted
because you look like your owner.

257
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,090
What is this?

258
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,390
A butthole got pierced! Oh, really.

259
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,640
The good natured me..

260
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,500
Have decided to forgive your eccentric owner.

261
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
I did well, right?

262
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,320
Possibly, like he said,

263
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,110
I think that there is an existence that I can't even imagine.

264
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,110
But your owner doesn't even say that it's hard.

265
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,910
So I think that you and I have to comfort him well.
Understand?

266
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,410
It's done.

267
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,410
The sewing is really well.

268
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,400
Hey, aren't you even embarrassed?

269
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,490
Going around everyday naked. Oo, pervert.

270
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,710
If...

271
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,650
If you were the Crown Princess...

272
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We will never have any fights and
will get along really harmoniously.

273
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,680
Maybe we could have been together until we are old.

274
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
because we have a lot of similarities.

275
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,500
One day Chaegyung asked me what my dream was.

276
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,790
it seemed like at that moment I heard a bang.

277
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,790
No one ever asked me what my dream was.

278
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,900
And I never even thought about it either.

279
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,200
Because either way my future is already decided.

280
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
And it won't change because I dream.

281
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,420
But after hearing what she said...

282
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,700
It came to be that I wanted to have a dream.

283
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,690
No matter what your dream is...

284
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,060
I'll support you if that's what you want.

285
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,960
On the road to realize your dream,
I will be an aiding force for sure.

286
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,900
Hyorin...

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,250
Don't expect anything from me anymore.

288
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,550
There isn't anything that I can do for you.

289
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,650
The time when I escorted you to the airport in Thailand.
That'll be my last remembrance present for you.

290
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,350
From now on there won't be another instance like that.

291
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,280
You have to listen to what I have to say too.

292
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,800
I won't expect anything from you anymore.

293
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,160
Even though you can't be good to me anymore.

294
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,960
It doesn't matter.

295
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,960
Just ... you just ... have to be as you are.

296
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,020
Just like how you're standing next to me right now...

297
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,280
... just as you are.

298
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,580
That's all I need.

299
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,000
Where did you go?

300
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,590
I'm ignored again.

301
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,810
Because Alfred's butthole exposed, I sewed it up.

302
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,130
As a service.

303
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,160
You did well.

304
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,450
Am I your maid?

305
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,280
What?

306
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,450
In these instances instead of
'you did well' you go 'thank you'.

307
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,590
Right?

308
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,900
That's right, owner. That's right,
that's right, that's right! Ou ~

309
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,840
I don't know that kind of stuff.

310
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,880
What about the pants?

311
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,830
You have become really charming.

312
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,030
You must have made a lot of girls cry.

313
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,820
Why are you like this?

314
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,430
Gongju Mama.

315
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,230
What Gongju Mama, kid.

316
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,720
Have you been well?

317
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,360
Just call me noona, okay?

318
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,560
Is it that hard to just say "thank you"? Jerk.

319
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,040
Duck and drake, syong.

320
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,820
WAH! Chiggachiggachiggachiggachigga.

321
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,610
Chaegyung, she...

322
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,280
it seems like she has a very good personality.

323
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,350
Although she is lacking in the maturity of a Crown Princess,

324
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,280
she has that kind of unique energy that fills up that gap.

325
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,280
Can't you feel it?

326
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,200
I heard you're in the same class as her in school.

327
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,200
Yes.

328
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,000
The more you get to know her, it seems like she has a charm that flutters the heart.

329
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,550
You guys don't know, right?

330
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,280
Yul Goon, is not a guy but a girl?

331
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,730
What? Really?

332
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,650
Before, he made me kimbap and it was very pretty.

333
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,000
Really?

334
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,600
Was there a time that we made kimbap during class time?

335
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,660
Nope.

336
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,180
Hey, perhaps Yul Goon only made it for Chaegyung?

337
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,450
No, it's not like that.

338
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,450
What about us? Yul Goon is stingy.
Why are you only giving it to Chaegyung?

339
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
I'm saying that it's not like that, really.

340
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,680
Tada~

341
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,080
It must be yummy.

342
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,460
Hey, be careful, be careful.

343
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,000
Alright!

344
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,650
It must be yummy.

345
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,810
Hey! It's not even done yet.

346
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,170
Finally, completion! Don't touch it.

347
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,190
Chaegyung..

348
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,080
Chaegyung ah~

349
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,590
Are you going to give the cake that
you made first time to your hubby first ?

350
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,360
Of course, he's her hubby.

351
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,990
How can I give him such kind of thing...

352
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,780
It doesn't matter if it's this or that kind...

353
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,520
the others aren't making a commotion
over giving it to their boyfriends.

354
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,900
If I gave it to him, would he like it?

355
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,010
What a blur fool.

356
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,610
What's so good about a husband who has secret love affairs?

357
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,110
Lee Shin.

358
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,240
What? H.R.?

359
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
Really... there's no other way.

360
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,770
What are you doing here?

361
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
To give you this.

362
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,020
It's the cake I just made.
Do you want to eat it?

363
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,700
It's okay.

364
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,910
Why? I'm telling you it's really yummy.
Have a bite. Really, say ah~.

365
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,780
You eat it.

366
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,040
Hey! A person has put effort into making this.

367
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,670
Can't you at least put an effort into eating it?

368
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,880
I don't want to eat it.

369
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,330
Especially since you touched it with your finger.

370
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,200
Next time, don't bring that sort of thing.

371
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,740
Really... really big jerk!

372
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,240
Ah, I'm really...

373
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,230
What is this? Duck!

374
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,090
Hey! Ish, that guy.

375
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,560
Whether I meet shin or not, it's my choice.

376
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,280
It's none of your business to come over
and start ranting at me.

377
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,250
It's not that I won't let you to meet Shin.

378
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,450
If you want to meet Shin,

379
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,200
Do it without letting Chaegyung knows.

380
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,900
Why? Why do I have to do that?

381
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,140
Didn't I beg for your help in the past?

382
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,030
But you said it before, right?

383
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,810
You can't let Shin give up his position on his free will...

384
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,570
You must snatch that position away.

385
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,270
I never said that I wanted to snatch it.

386
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,220
I just said that I can't bear to see
him giving his position on his free will.

387
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,570
Is there any difference?

388
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,260
Anyway...

389
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,500
I'll make Shin give up his position willingly.

390
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,140
It doesn't matter to me if you are or
not to snatch away that position.

391
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,070
Before I made my final decision..

392
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,490
I'll never allow Shin to give up his position on his free will.

393
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,110
I'm not snatching it..

394
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,810
I'm only taking back what should be returned to me.

395
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,910
And..

396
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
I'll never hurt what he should return to me.

397
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,180
That is all I want to say.

398
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,950
It's better for us to follow the Great Queen's decisions.

399
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,780
She'll still make a reasonable decision,
no matter how angry she is.

400
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,310
Pyeha...

401
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,850
Those are supposed to be their positions originally..

402
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,640
Our decisions were made to protect our standing power only.

403
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,090
Pyeha... why are you saying these?

404
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,330
The truth is...

405
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,850
I had already started considering
when Hwi Sung Gong came back.

406
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,050
The successor to the future King...

407
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,200
Will not base on the succeeding ranks but will be judged on their abilities and intelligence.

408
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,330
I finally finished the book of Filial Piety today.

409
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,050
So don't mention it anymore.

410
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,040
Choi Sang Gong is so strict.

411
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,400
You won't even last an hour if you were me.

412
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,740
Hey, time's up, I have to go...

413
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,130
Well... it's almost time that Shin
comes back after completing his fencing.

414
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
I want to appear suddenly before him as if it's a coincidence.

415
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,100
Surprise!

416
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,100
Hey, he really is here. I'll call you back later.

417
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Gotta go... bye~~!

418
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,510
Kang Hyun.. bye..!

419
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,130
Do you have anything urgent?

420
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,790
Why are you here at such a late hour?

421
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
HalmaMama, seems to have something urgent.

422
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,700
Is that so?

423
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,110
I have something to ask you now as well.

424
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
What?

425
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,050
What's the thing that you really
want to do most if you become King?

426
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,950
That's a very sudden question.

427
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,020
I never thought about it.

428
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,280
Really? Never?

429
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,870
That's right.

430
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,150
The thing that I want to do most is
to get rid of political marriages.

431
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,930
You?

432
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,090
Me?

433
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,590
All of the Princes besides the Crown Prince
must be living outside the palace.

434
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,240
I want to get rid of this kind of rules.

435
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
Is that so?

436
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,000
I feel that the Royal family's tragic story
started all because of it.

437
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,450
Yes, I agree as well.

438
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,590
It became like this because of that rules.

439
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,730
That's right.

440
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,250
But then...

441
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,400
The new tragic story had occurred
because of a political marriage, right?

442
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
You seem to have thought a lot.

443
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,850
Look like you'll have to be the King for sure.

444
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,960
It's not me but you.

445
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,410
You always seems to be rebellious and
unconcerned over the royal position.

446
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,400
But you have lots of thoughts as well over the King's place.

447
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,660
Is that so?

448
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,890
I have also thought over some things because of you.

449
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,750
What's so great about the King's position?

450
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,830
All the adults and children are all fighting over it.

451
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,570
I really can't understand.

452
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,340
The world is not as romantic as you imagine it to be.

453
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,970
Then are you also interested in the King's position?

454
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,250
To say it directly, it's time to start showing an interest in it.

455
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,850
I thought that you were not...

456
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,950
Even though you are part of the Royal family..

457
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,950
I thought that you won't be interested in
the Palace's internal position battle.

458
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,600
But I won't change because of that.

459
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,350
But then, you have became a stranger.

460
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,280
After Crown Prince Hyo Ryul had been mourned as a King..

461
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,440
Hye Jung Gong will become the Great Queen.

462
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,300
Hwi Sung Goon will be given
the rank of Gong Jin Wang.

463
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,750
But because of Hye Jung Gong's humble request...

464
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,240
She will not be given the special privilege of the Great Queen.

465
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,000
And after Hwi Sung Goon becomes Gong Jin Wang,

466
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,980
You'll get the same ranking position as the Crown Prince to succeed the throne.

467
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,450
HalmaMama...

468
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,280
Yes...

469
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,650
Are you asking why you can't since your title is originally higher than the Prince?

470
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,350
Are you feeling unhappy because you are at the same succeeding position as the Prince?

471
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,250
No, HalmaMama.

472
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,990
I... only wish to be given the title of Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

473
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,950
Hwi Sung Dae Goon?

474
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,600
That's a position below the Crown Prince.

475
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,350
Yes, Mama.

476
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,200
It seems to be better like that after I thought over it.

477
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,280
That period of time is already chaotic enough.

478
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,500
So if there's a change in the succeeding positions...

479
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,900
The 'cracks' inside the Palace will be increasing as well.

480
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,250
But...

481
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,350
What you said is right as well.

482
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,150
That's why I...

483
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,250
Hope to hold the Chu Jeon without any mix reactions about it.

484
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,250
And I also wish that the Royal family
can also maintain its harmony.

485
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,350
Well... is this what you really want?

486
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,550
Yes, HalmaMama.

487
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,600
I hope that you'll approve.

488
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,250
What?

489
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,600
Yul never do such a thing.

490
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,450
Is this the truth, Seol Sang Gong?

491
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,350
OK, then how's the Great Queen's reaction?

492
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,550
Oh my God.

493
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
Mom!

494
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,350
What? Are you afraid that I'll commit suicide again?

495
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,600
Sorry, Mom.

496
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,250
Then, why do you have do such sorry things?

497
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,210
We have missed what seems to be the best timing.

498
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,130
Sorry...

499
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,760
I'm really sorry...

500
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:59,250
But, we can't go on like this.

501
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,650
Just let the matter end here.

502
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,750
We'll be in danger as well, if we still continue.

503
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,450
Whether if it's right or wrong, dangerous or safe.
I'll make the decision for it.

504
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,900
Congratulations to you.

505
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,390
The Chu Jeon will end completely once the tablet is placed at the Ancestral temple.

506
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Although it's something to be talked about later,

507
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,280
you'll have to eat inside the palace for tomorrow's lunch.

508
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,700
Although it's only half of the Chu Jeon...

509
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,350
It looks like we didn't completely suffer any loss in the end.

510
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,930
This is only the start.

511
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,550
So please give me more of your support, Tang Shu Dae In.

512
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,250
The King has arrived.

513
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,280
My dear fellow citizens...

514
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,910
Pyeha! Pyeha!

515
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,610
Father! Father!

516
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,350
Is there anything interesting acting on the television?

517
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,250
What? Aren't these Zebras?

518
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,650
No... that can't be true.

519
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,280
Is that a real live situation?

520
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,600
It's a real live situation.

521
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,280
Oh, yes.

522
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,200
Speaking of it, how could such a thing happen?

523
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,140
Although he might look a little sickly...

524
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,370
But he can't have just faint suddenly.

525
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,950
That's right.

526
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,060
Right.

527
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,740
That's right, Seo Hwa Yeong.

528
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,570
That Vixen must have made a voodoo doll.

529
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,490
Stick it full of pins, says some incantations
and use the nails to stab non-stop.

530
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,070
Won't it be like this? Right?

531
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,880
That's too exaggerated.

532
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,870
Have you been seeing too much of
those old period dramas?

533
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,120
But, it seems like something big has happened.

534
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,680
Our Chaegyung...

535
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,270
What happened to Chaegyung?

536
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,120
That's right..

537
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,790
Quick! Give Chaegyung... No..
Our BigungMama, a call..

538
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,610
Mama, did you hear about it?

539
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,140
The King had fainted during the Public meeting.

540
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,710
What?

541
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,700
What did you just say?

542
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,630
And so, has he regained consciousness?

543
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,120
I still haven't got the news for that part.

544
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,380
I'll go find out the details immediately.

545
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,900
What happened actually?

546
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,420
He can't drop down this fast.

547
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,530
The situation now is very lucky.

548
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,670
Just follow the Royal doctors' instructions.

549
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,840
Don't ask anything about work.

550
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:28,770
Just go to the Yun Yang Heng Gong
for convalescent in a peaceful state of mind.

551
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,780
Yes, UhmaMama.

552
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm sorry to let you worry.

553
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,270
Queen, the things you must take over.

554
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,580
Pyeha...

555
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,040
Please don't worry about your work.

556
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,470
Isn't it so, that the Prince and the internal Officers are around?

557
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,990
They won't do anything wrong when
they do your duties in your stead.

558
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,140
Yes, Pyeha.

559
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,340
Please put your worries to rest.

560
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,140
Please don't worry, AhbaMama.

561
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,670
Pyeha... please recover quickly and return in a healthy state.

562
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,000
You must.

563
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,190
You are not allowed to read any more historical books.

564
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,360
And you must be absolutely silent.

565
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,240
Gongju, you must be more attentive
when you are at Pyeha's side.

566
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,710
Yes.

567
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,330
Please don't worry, Mom.

568
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,650
That's right.

569
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,950
We still have our smart HaeMyung here.

570
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,010
I'll follow your orders in respect, Tae-hu Mama.

571
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,450
Now, the old era has been broken down.

572
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,500
It's time to welcome the new generation.

573
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,980
Then, let's have a 'duel' and see.

574
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,460
Congratulations on the Chu Jeon.

575
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,780
Thanks, Seja.

576
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,810
How have you been lately?

577
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,350
I have been getting along very well because of your good fortune.

578
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,060
TaeHu-Mama.

579
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,470
There have been lots of troubles
appearing lately around the Palace.

580
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,030
So you must be extra careful when you leave the palace.

581
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,240
You won't know when or where
you are going to be attacked, isn't it so?

582
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,960
Thank you for your concern.

583
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,600
TaeHu-Mama.

584
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,070
I'm always abnormally alert when I'm outside.

585
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,650
I'll find a way myself to stop it even if that person uses magic.

586
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,950
But then, the biggest enemy is always somewhere close by.

587
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,950
And this is what makes people really worry.
For this, I have my own counter attack.

588
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,500
So please rest your worries, TaeHu-Mama.

589
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,230
Chosun's In Su Dae Bi...
after the death of her husband, Yul Kyung Seja.

590
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,730
Her dreams of becoming the Queen has
also made with obstacles.

591
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,660
But she captured a chance
10 years later when Ye Jong died.

592
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,900
She turned around the heart of
her mother in-law, Queen Jung Hee.

593
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,160
Overthrows the original son.

594
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:16,330
Supports and helps her own son,
Cho Ee Shan Goon to become the King.

595
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,170
Then.. the King that ascended, is he Sung Jong?

596
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,990
Yes, Mama.

597
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,630
That's right.

598
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:27,160
In Su Dae Bi couldn't have done it completely on her own.

599
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,150
To change her mother in-law's heart
like Han MyungHae.

600
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,850
The help from the people around is also very important.

601
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,410
Mama, I'll always be at your service.

602
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,970
Yes, Mama.

603
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,370
Mama's era is about to come.

604
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,120
TaeHu-Mama.

605
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,740
Let's work hand in hand from now on.

606
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,840
Are you done with your sightseeing?

607
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,350
Yes.

608
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,110
You'll just have to bear it temporary for me.

609
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,590
Do you understand? HwangJae Pyeha.

610
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,750
The Museum invited me?

611
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,010
Yes.

612
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,150
"The heart to heart" has already ended successfully.

613
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:37,530
It seems to be the return present for the thank you medal you gave them the last time.

614
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,270
That's right.

615
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,970
That "thank you" medal has a deep meaning behind it.

616
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,170
They have been making dolls to support those heart diseased children for 10 years.

617
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,660
And they have sold as many as 1 million of them.

618
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,830
1 million?

619
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,950
1 million..

620
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,580
Hundred, thousand, 10 thousand, 100 thousand...

621
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,990
Mama, do you want to go?

622
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,600
It should be not bad to participate for once.

623
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,780
That's right.

624
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,480
There's no reason to refuse it
since I'm already invited as well.

625
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,790
What do you want to go together, Seja and Bingung?

626
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,230
What?

627
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,530
Do you want to go there with me to enjoy the breeze?

628
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:23,880
Well.

629
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,580
That seems to be a little difficult.

630
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,070
How? Can we go together?

631
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,980
Jeonha's pre-booking schedule is already full-booked.

632
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,730
I'm afraid that that'll be difficult to reschedule at this time, Mama.

633
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,360
Is that so?

634
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,740
How will you feel if Bingung goes with you?

635
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,280
How do you feel about it, Bingung?

636
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,400
Yes. I'd like to.

637
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,890
I'd like it very much, Mama.

638
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,680
Then, it's settled.

639
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,900
Then, I'll just go with together Bingung this time.

640
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,800
Hello?

641
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,800
Goon Nae Gwan ahjushi...

642
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,350
By any chance,
when I go to Jejudo with the Great Queen...

643
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,550
Can I bring along Shin's camera?

644
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,050
There's some use.

645
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,550
So I thought of asking you to help me tell Shin Goon about it.

646
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,660
Really?

647
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,910
Then, I'll look for it myself.

648
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,550
Please remember to tell Shin Goon about it.

649
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,680
Or else I won't know what
he'll say with that temper of his.

650
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,250
Yes.

651
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,600
Thanks.

652
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,640
Yes.

653
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,550
I have to do my search.

654
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,580
Where? Where's it?

655
00:49:59,010 --> 00:49:59,890
Right, stupid.

656
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,560
It'll be in there, of course.

657
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,910
Where's it?

658
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,840
It's here.

659
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,950
1..2..3..

660
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,810
Open.. Open.. Door!

661
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,410
It's open.

662
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,810
Where's it?

663
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,860
H.R?

664
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,550
The necklace that I had given you the last time...

665
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,920
Do you know the meaning of the words engraved on that necklace?

666
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,610
That Spanish word, Es pena...

667
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,690
It means sadness.

668
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,950
Sadness...

669
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,370
It's the same as what I'm feeling now...

670
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,890
At the book shop,
I once told you to remain by my side, right?

671
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,950
Then, I'll also be by your side forever.

672
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,800
What happened?

673
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,750
Are you crying again?

674
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:47,850
It's none of your business.

675
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,900
Have you found the camera yet?

676
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,450
Didn't you tell the internal Officer to tell that to me?

677
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,100
Are you still unable to let go?

678
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,750
What are you talking about?

679
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,430
You keep everything that you received from that person, cherished and keeping them one by one.

680
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,480
Do you cherish them so much?

681
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,180
Do you still like Hyorin?

682
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,200
Why are you bringing this up suddenly?

683
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,650
And why are you like this?! You!

684
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:24,100
Jeonha, the Queen requests for you.

685
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,740
Prince.

686
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,950
Please treat Bingung better.

687
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,870
Although she's always making mistakes.

688
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,610
Please just think on the account that she had entered the palace at such a young age.

689
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,880
She must have been really lonely.

690
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,740
So just try to understand her more as well.

691
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,620
If even the Prince that she has to accompany is not concern either, she'll feel even worse.

692
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,550
What sort of marriage is this?

693
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,750
It's a political marriage.

694
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,300
Although both of you are still young.

695
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,670
You find nothing wrong with the political marriage and treats each other as friends.

696
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,410
But as you grow older...

697
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:04,700
The Princess will be the person who carries down the bloodline of the Royal family.

698
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,410
The person who gives birth and
educate the Royal grandchildren...

699
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,430
I heard that the Princess and Hwi Sung Goon
are in the same class, right?

700
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,030
Yes.

701
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,610
What's wrong with it?

702
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,250
It's nothing at all.

703
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,560
If you can't love each other true heartedly...

704
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,690
Both of you will be become really unfortunate.

705
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,060
Seja, so please be more accommodating.

706
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,820
Mama. Just press here and see.

707
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,530
Put your hand here.

708
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,480
It's beating.

709
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,170
The heart's beating.

710
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:17,730
The Great Queen has always been managing lots of areas to help those children with heart problems.

711
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,170
"The heart to heart" event is
the one with the best response.

712
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,820
Have you touched it yet?

713
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,330
I'm expressing my thanks again to the Museum who had gave all the earnings made to our Financial group.

714
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,930
You are really welcome, Tae Hwang Mama.

715
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:39,550
This time I really experienced how the happiness of sharing is so much greater than the all the other happiness.

716
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:45,260
It also lets me comprehends both the happiness of joy and harvest, I'm grateful for that.

717
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,680
Thanks again for inviting me and
I feel even more grateful at heart.

718
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,890
That's why I specially asked
the Princess to come with me.

719
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,210
Yes, Mama.

720
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,550
That's truly our honor.

721
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,150
Unni...

722
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,010
That's Alfred!

723
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:05,800
That's Alfred too!

724
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,610
It's exactly the same.

725
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,850
The eyes look really sad.

726
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,780
I caught something.

727
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,350
It's not ready yet.

728
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,910
Is this really me?

729
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,070
Yes.

730
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,290
Although my talents are limited...

731
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,660
But this isn't me at all.

732
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:27,440
There isn't a single wrinkle and it's a bit too rounded.

733
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:28,980
What?

734
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,800
Well...

735
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,210
Just look at our portraits from before.

736
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:38,510
Even the dimples, fine lines and
bone structure are all drawn really clearly.

737
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:45,000
You can't do any cheating records, these are have the Ancestor's profound meaning in them.

738
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,410
To say it out in modern words.

739
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,970
That's to draw out a Bareheaded photo picture, right?

740
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:52,820
Yes.

741
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:53,910
But...

742
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,720
Lately these Bareheaded photos have also come in a soft mist mode and it's effect is really great as well.

743
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,800
Soft mist?

744
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,340
It's to make use of the computer to create a blur effect.

745
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:07,260
That way, the face will have the effect a soft mist surrounding it and looks really pretty.

746
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,370
That's why it's call Photoshop.

747
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,580
Pictures are not only used to chase after the feeling of beauty.

748
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,420
It's more important to record down the real facts in the portrait.

749
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,600
Then...

750
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,350
I'll redraw.

751
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,950
Our portraits from before,
doesn't allow a single mistake.

752
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,630
Even if you drew a strand of the eyebrows wrongly...

753
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,130
That'll mean that you are drawing someone else.

754
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:49,320
That's to say not only the outer appearance. You must also draw out the inner self.

755
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:58,620
Oh my God!

756
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,110
This is...

757
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,440
Do you have any problem with that?

758
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,190
This.. this.. are my wrinkles that deep?

759
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,000
Well...

760
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,850
About that...

761
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:16,190
So isn't better to do some soft mist..
soft mist effect..

762
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,210
I'm going up to rest.

763
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:27,000
I made the Princess come to Jeju Island to accompany an old lady.

764
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,310
It really doesn't seems reasonable at all.

765
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,490
What are you doing here?

766
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:59,220
Didn't you say that your schedule is full?

767
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,640
Of course, there are something urgent to do.

768
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,950
And some others that can be push back later as well.

769
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,740
The truth is...

770
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,150
HalmaMama had requested for me to come along.

771
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,790
I kept thinking about it after I rejected.

772
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,280
Well then...

773
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,340
She now in her room,
you can go there right now to report to her.

774
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,730
I'm tired and I want to rest a while.
