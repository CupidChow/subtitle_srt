00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,760
Episode 8

2
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,640
Unnies!!

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,680
Were you well?

4
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,730
You look the same..

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,460
Since the both of you haven't
been in the Palace lately,

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,620
all the lights of the world
were turned off, and...

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,730
It felt empty in here.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,300
Yes, that was so.

9
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,330
It's a relief to see you two again..
both healthy.

10
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,860
Thank you.
I missed you two so much, too.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,750
Yes, I missed both Internal Officer Kong and Choi Sang Gong, too.

12
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,740
How about us?

13
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,390
Stop being fussy.

14
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,460
It's not only you who has to
be separated from your parents.

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,810
Almost all women have to
once they get married.

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Am I the same as other people?

17
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,370
I'm only nineteen now.

18
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,560
In this country,
you are ranked as the third highest women.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,940
And such a person still acted so childish in front of my parents in-law.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,070
You haven't got off milk yet, right?

21
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,550
Right, when you went to sleep last night, did your parents lull you to sleep with a lullaby?

22
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,420
Don't say things like that.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,870
Don't you have times when you want to see the Queen and King?

24
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,810
Nope, never. To the point that I thought how you acted was weird.

25
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,730
Really?

26
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,210
I thought we got closer during the one week we spent together.

27
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,180
But why is he so mean to me suddenly?

28
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,820
Did he find out about how
I really feel about him?

29
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,000
Why are you suddenly like that?

30
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,540
What is?

31
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,250
I said why did you suddenly hug me like that?

32
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,250
Oh, that…

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,070
You didn't get any sleep that day, right?

34
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,370
What do you mean by that day?

35
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,760
Are you asking because you don't know?

36
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,050
I thought it was weird that you were getting close to my back, trying to seduce me.

37
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,850
Seduce? What do you mean by that?

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,270
Don't worry. To be honest, I wasn't able to sleep that day either.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,340
What do you mean by you didn't get to sleep?

40
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,440
Look here,
I'm in the prime of manhood, too.

41
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,320
The prime of manhood?

42
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,040
What I'm saying is.. at my age,

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,830
whether she's pretty or not,

44
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,260
when a girl is lying right behind your back,

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:11,750
the feeling of your heart flaming and throbbing makes it hard to go to sleep like that.

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,940
But, what does flaming and throbbing have to do with not letting you go to sleep? You can just go to

47
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,550
sleep regardless of those things.

48
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,480
Shut up! And yesterday, it seems like you wanted to touch my back.

49
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,900
Here, touch it.

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,660
Get away.

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,900
Just touch it since I'm letting you.

52
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,550
And don't just sneak up on my back.

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
When did I do that?

54
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,310
You two haven't gone to sleep yet,
have you?

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,580
Is it that since you haven't been in the Palace for so long that you're uncomfortable in some way?

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,020
No, we're not uncomfortable.

57
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,950
Okay, then I'll be going.

58
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,820
Goodbye.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,500
What do you want to do for
tomorrows morning greetings...

60
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,100
Are the two of you going together...

61
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,060
OK, I'll just go now.

62
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,650
I guess I'll just continue what I was doing…

63
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,600
No matter if it's the parents or children, we do the house farming together with no one left out.

64
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,000
You mean everyone?

65
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,270
You too?

66
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,910
Yes.

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:05,760
I've seen it on TV dramas but I never knew that people in real life would do that.

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
I agree.

69
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,450
The thing that left the most impression on me was the toothbrush.

70
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,720
Toothbrush?

71
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,450
Yes.

72
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,150
Maybe it's because they use the same bathroom, but all the toothbrushes the family used were stored in one cup.

73
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,780
The heads of the toothbrush touching each other.

74
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,790
The heads touching each other?

75
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,990
Rather than the family treating each other in their certain ranks in the family, they seemed to be like friends.

76
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,300
Like friends?

77
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,960
Then does that mean a family can
become like friends?

78
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,840
Why are you being like that again?

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,780
I miss my Princess.

80
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,110
Oh, really.

81
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,360
Dad, aren't you going to cook for us today?

82
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Hey, do you only see food
when you look at me?

83
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,860
Dad, the stew...

84
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,790
Don't talk to me.

85
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,700
Today is the kitchen's rest day.

86
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:26,530
Yesterday the house was so full of entertainment but now since Chaegyung is gone, it feels empty.

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,990
She finally came home and I couldn't even do anything for her.

88
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,750
No, you were the best to her.

89
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,010
The pig got to eat a lot of lettuce wraps that she couldn't eat at the Palace.

90
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,170
He's right.
Even the Crown Prince liked your cooking.

91
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,880
No he didn't. Really?

92
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,230
Wait a minute. What's this smell?

93
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,610
ChaeJoon it smells like something's
burning, doesn't it?

94
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,120
I asked you already, if you were cooking stew?

95
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,220
Huh?

96
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,940
You! Why are you telling this to me now!

97
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,810
You said not to talk to you.

98
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,590
Aigoo~

99
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,170
Prince, is the preparations for the Royal family writer awards completed?

100
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,330
Yes, UmmaMama.

101
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:42,390
You have to take care of your father like a shadow at the presentation. He may be dizzy during that time.

102
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,600
Okay, I will.

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,850
When I think about the King's health, I get nervous and worried.

104
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,510
Think about your mother and do all your duties as a son dutifully.

105
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,140
Yes, UmmaMama.

106
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,310
Mom...

107
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:24,330
Prince, what did you say just now?

108
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Have you become weak since you've gone to the wife's parents house?

109
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,280
Think about Yul and his mother.

110
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,370
Though right now it doesn't seem like anything is going on, but we don't know when or if...

111
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,680
they might try to attack your position as Crown Prince. It's a tight situation that can break at any minute.

112
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,370
At times like this,
you should protect your position.

113
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,310
You are in a position to become Crown Prince.

114
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,140
Shin, from now on your in the position where you're going to become the Crown Prince.

115
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,320
So from now on you can't act childish anymore.
You can't ever use the word "mom” again.

116
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,660
It's "your majesty” from now on, okay?
You can't call me "mom”.

117
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,320
Everyone will be observing you, so you can't let
your guard down. You can't be like others.

118
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,740
The Crown Prince is special because he is to become a King.

119
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,200
Do you understand?
You are a special person to become a King.

120
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,820
But, something's really
bothering you right?

121
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,880
What is it?

122
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,710
It's nothing.

123
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,670
What do you mean it's nothing?
You look really sad.

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,300
Oh last time when you got hit by an egg and you
were sad, you said you needed my comfort, right?

125
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,240
OK, I'm going to start now.

126
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,660
OK, part 1- to make the Prince laugh.

127
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,050
"Jeonha, laugh.
You look cool when you laugh.”

128
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,840
Is this too hard? Okay,
I'm going to do an imitation that is easier.

129
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,500
"Jeonha, Seja, come in”

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,710
Mama, you shouldn't do this!

131
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:26,940
Mama, you shouldn't do this!
Mama! Mama!

132
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,220
Mama! BigungMama!

133
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,420
Mama! Mama! BigungMama!

134
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,050
Mama!

135
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,980
Let's go inside.
It's time for you to learn.

136
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,070
Okay. After I go around just one more lap.

137
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,290
Mama!

138
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:33,280
Oh, it's tiring. Shin Goon, I mean Seja Jeonha, what are you doing here?

139
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,590
Isn't it time for you to learn
characters right now?

140
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,560
I was going to go now anyways.

141
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,150
Mama, if you think about
your appearance as a Princess,

142
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,880
it is not right for your majesty to ride a bicycle inside the Palace.

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,300
What? Okay.

144
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,040
Then I guess I can't ride it anymore.

145
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,770
I know it's troublesome but what if
she rides it only in the exercise area?

146
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,240
I'll just ride it in the exercise area.

147
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,550
But honestly it's really nice to
ride the bike inside the Palace.

148
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,860
Since it's time for you to study,
so I will take care of it.

149
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,650
And you should ride it too.

150
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,890
No. How can a person like me dare to ride it inside the Palace. Then I will be leaving now.

151
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,370
Goodbye.

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,770
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

153
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,650
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

154
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,750
Jeonha!

155
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,340
Seja Jeonha!

156
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,300
What is it, BigungMama?

157
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,050
You know, I have a request.

158
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,780
A request? What is it?

159
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:27,400
Next week we have to hand in an assignment in art class, so class is going to end later.

160
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,730
So?

161
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,550
So, there's no reason for us
to go to school together.

162
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,850
You need your own car?

163
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,490
Is that what you're trying to say?

164
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,060
My own car?

165
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,440
I don't think there has been a time ever where the Princess got to have her own car.

166
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,550
Forget about it, BigungMama.

167
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,000
No, it's not that…

168
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,150
Fine, okay.

169
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay, I understand.

170
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,430
It's okay to be late.

171
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,690
Okay, yes, yes.

172
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,730
Even though my son-in-law is the Prince, I am his wife's father.

173
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,580
I'll find out for you.

174
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,180
No, you don't have to thank me.

175
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,470
Go in, Mr. Jang.

176
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,900
So many people are calling.

177
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,260
Hello?

178
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,380
Uncle?

179
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,750
I sent my daughter back to
the Palace yesterday.

180
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,400
Yes? Tea?

181
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm drinking it right now.

182
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,490
Oh, you mean an automobile car?

183
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,170
Oh really?

184
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:21,140
I can get in communication with
the imperial household.

185
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,240
No, that's not it. The thing is...

186
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,510
Hello? Hello?

187
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:45,110
Oh uncle, static. Yes, there's static.
I'll call you later.

188
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,900
This position I'm in now is so busy that there are endless calls.

189
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,860
Hello!

190
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,080
Did you hurt your neck?

191
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,650
It's nothing serious, BigungMama.

192
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,320
Starting from today,
you will start using a different car.

193
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,200
What? My own car?

194
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,430
Yes, Mama.

195
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,160
It was an order that you would use the car that the Great Queen was using.

196
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,430
The Great Queen's car?

197
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:41,610
Yes. The Prince said that you needed a car.

198
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,950
What? Shin Goon...
I mean the Prince said that?

199
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,080
Yes, Mama.

200
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,650
Princess, from now on,
you can use this car.

201
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,680
What? Okay.

202
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Why? You don't like this car?

203
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,360
No, it's not that.
Mama, thank you.

204
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,700
But can I ask you a question?

205
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,020
How old is this car?

206
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,350
How old?

207
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,120
You're asking how old a car is?

208
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,980
It came out in 1972.

209
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,060
It's 34 years old this year, Mama.

210
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,120
Then that means it's fifteen years older than me?

211
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:15,350
But since the Great Queen treated it well, she maintains and takes care of it well, so it's like a new car.

212
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,680
Oh, I see.

213
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,270
Her Highness was the first generation consultant for the cars ten years movements.

214
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,790
So it's like that?

215
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,530
People are like cars, we must move more to stay young and not get old.

216
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,480
I haven't been using it lately.

217
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,920
So there was a slight problem
when I drove it here.

218
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,880
But...

219
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,900
It has lots of memories with me
like a old family friend.

220
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,240
So I hope that the Princess will take care of it, the same way I did.

221
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,730
That's of course.

222
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,240
Honestly,
I was surprised to see you drove it yourself.

223
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,150
I like this car a lot.

224
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,450
I'll take good care of her.

225
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,840
Thanks, Mama.

226
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,170
Give bow.

227
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,340
What's with these pants?

228
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,090
Who told you to put pencils in your hair?

229
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,960
Hey, hey, hey!

230
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,720
All the kids are following your fashion.

231
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,230
Yup, now your fashion is an icon.

232
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,590
Oh, that's right. Finally, your picture came out.
Sign here, Princess.

233
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,240
Now that I see the picture you
do look like a Princess.

234
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,050
It's amazing.

235
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,880
But is this really you?

236
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,750
I feel as if you're becoming a different person.

237
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,900
No, I'm still the same.

238
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,070
Don't worry, Lee Kang-hyung.
I won't change.

239
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,650
Ding-Dong!

240
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,550
You cheap-o. You liar.

241
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,450
Your body's so nice…

242
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Bring her to our meetings from now on because we have enough room.

243
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,220
It's not like I haven't thought about it, but I still think it's too early.

244
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,870
It's not early?
She seems to do her Palace duties well, too.

245
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,650
Why? If she joins the club, you think people will outcast her in the club?

246
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,250
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

247
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,070
Is Min Hyorin being too nice?

248
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,240
What is that? Why are you bringing her in?
Is the club for everyone to come into?

249
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
I'm going to oppose.

250
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,690
No way, no way!

251
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,280
It's not for you to oppose and Shin is for it, too.

252
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,120
We made the decision already.

253
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,300
Really?

254
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
Shin said it was okay?

255
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm going to lose my sense of taste.

256
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,290
Our level is going to drop rapidly.

257
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,630
I'm so embarrassed!

258
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,050
What are you trying to do?

259
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,750
What do you mean what am I trying to do?

260
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,650
I'm the club's manager. I made the decision due to the club's interest.

261
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,710
I told you about Camilla before, right?

262
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,100
Camilla?

263
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,820
Oh, the one who waited
35 years to become the Queen.

264
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,370
She's not a Queen yet, she's still a Princess.

265
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,260
Yeah, whatever. But what about her?

266
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,660
Do you know what Camilla's secret was?

267
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,960
To become a family's friend.

268
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,290
Family's friend?

269
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,080
Camilla even told Charles to marry Diana.

270
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,850
She was a good friend to Diana who can't adapt to the Royal family.

271
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,470
She even gave Charles lots of good suggestions.

272
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,370
And they rode horses together, too.

273
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,470
Doesn't it sound like it will be fun?

274
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,180
"The biggest sky is always behind your back”

275
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,170
What happened?

276
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,310
We can't find him.

277
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,000
He was just in the study room, where could he have disappeared to?

278
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,250
What are you still standing around? Go look for the Prince.

279
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,590
Yes, Internal Officer..

280
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,100
How could this happen?

281
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,150
He was learning traditional military arts, has he learned the art of moving anywhere in a flash?

282
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,640
Give me a minute.

283
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,940
That's weird. Where did he go?

284
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,950
Did he go through the floor or
did he go above the sky?

285
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:43,350
Shin Goon! Shin Goon!
Where did he go?

286
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,850
What is this? A ladder?

287
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,430
I didn't know there was a place like this here.

288
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,750
What is it?

289
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,580
How'd you come up here?

290
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Didn't you see it when
you came over my house?

291
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,000
My house has an attic, too.

292
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,970
The Prince has never shown his bare feet.

293
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,050
Can I ask you something?

294
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,900
I haven't spent a lot of time in the Palace.

295
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,530
There are lots of things that I'm curious about.

296
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,640
Why do you have so many secrets?

297
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,340
What is that teddy bear all about?

298
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,300
It's tattered and torn and you are still not willing to throw it away.

299
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,790
Bear pride?

300
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,580
Pride? What do you mean?

301
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,150
Jeonha. Seja Jeonha.

302
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,350
Wow. These guys are so efficient.

303
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,310
The Crown Prince is here.

304
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,570
What are you doing?!

305
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,540
OK, OK, I know. I won't do it again.

306
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,270
Internal Officers, Uncles. HERE!

307
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,580
What are you doing? The next move...

308
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,460
Quick. The next move.

309
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,270
Switch off the phone.

310
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,440
It's Min Hyorin.

311
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,400
Yes. It's decided then.

312
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,720
Oh yes.
The Crown Princess is right beside you right?

313
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,980
Please put her on the line.

314
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
The Crown Princess?

315
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,640
It's for you.

316
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,880
Hello?

317
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,300
Hello. It's me Min Hyorin.

318
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,260
Just to inform you.
There is a gathering next week.

319
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,450
It's okay.
Don't feel stress or anything like that.

320
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,650
Before attending,
you have to learn how to ride right?

321
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,310
There are professional horsemen in the Palace.

322
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,690
Okay then. I will teach you in the future.
Don't worry.

323
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,930
Since when did Hyorin become so close with that ugly duckling?

324
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,030
Hello.

325
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,870
It's okay.

326
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,650
It's okay, carry on.

327
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,060
Okay. I know.

328
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,220
Thanks for coming.

329
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,150
What for?

330
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,870
I love to ride. It's perfect.

331
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,090
I know what you want.

332
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,860
What do you mean?

333
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,300
What do I want?

334
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,800
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

335
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,450
What I meant is that whatever that you desire now is what I desire as well.

336
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,570
You were supposed to be the heir.

337
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,800
Shin should be tired now, right?

338
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,480
It must be tiring to fit into the position that is unsuitable for him.

339
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,730
And also, having to marry
someone he doesn't like.

340
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:43,060
If Shin wasn't the Crown Prince, then there won't be any reason for that marriage continue.

341
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,850
It will eventually be voided.

342
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,030
Even if he yearns to be free, he has to consider his status so he hesitates.

343
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,190
So you have to help.

344
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:03,260
You are not stealing Shin's position,
you are helping him.

345
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,770
I understand what you mean.

346
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,550
But it's unacceptable for Shin to leave his position on his own accord.

347
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,220
What did you say?

348
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,300
We will talk about this another time.

349
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,230
The Royal Couple has arrived.

350
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,740
Yah. It's been a while, Friend.

351
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,600
You are getting prettier, Crown Princess.

352
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,960
Isn't she dressed sexy today?

353
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,720
Who are you trying to impress
by dressing this way?

354
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,150
Impress? What impress?
Who should I impress?

355
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,150
The Palace maids picked it out for me.

356
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,730
Yah. That's really disappointing.

357
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:59,930
Why are you disappointed?
You think I'd dress up for you?

358
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,800
I don't think so right? Right?

359
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,710
Hi.

360
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,500
You came.

361
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,540
It's been a while.

362
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,220
Looking at you from such a close distance, you've changed a lot recently.

363
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,440
We've seemed to distant quite alot unknowingly.

364
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,270
Walking by without even
greeting each other anymore.

365
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,160
You were cold to me the other time as well.

366
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,420
You've really changed a lot.

367
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,610
So, you should have just
agreed when I proposed to you.

368
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,820
You have given that up, feeling sorry now?

369
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,930
It is because she is the Crown Princess now, so you are feeling a little upset.

370
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,400
But isn't it all good now?

371
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,190
I feel so lucky.

372
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,300
What's wrong with the both of them?

373
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,400
They're not riding,
just looking at each other so bitterly.

374
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,880
Don't expect too much from Shin.

375
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,750
The higher the expectations
the bigger the disappointment.

376
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,590
He will treat you well occasionally.

377
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,050
But eventually,
it is Hyorin that he likes the most.

378
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,580
He will never look at you that way.

379
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,150
His heart belongs somewhere else.

380
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,000
I feel that Hyorin is better.

381
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,150
The truth is that the Crown Princess has changed for the better but she is still far away from the standard.

382
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,680
But it's game over.
They are married now.

383
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,650
I don't think it's nice sticking
herself in between the couple.

384
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,500
I heard that the Crown Prince even proposed to her.

385
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,040
She gave up the position in the first place.

386
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,700
Where did you hear that from?

387
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,600
Whatever it is, trying to get close to the Crown Prince now,  isn't that too much?

388
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,700
If it was me,
I would give up regardless of the past.

389
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,900
Really?

390
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,100
The truth is she does have the criteria for the Crown Princess.

391
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,210
Yes, that's right.

392
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,470
She comes from a wealthy family, but obviously it cannot be compared to the Royals.

393
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,950
She seems to be hidden up behind the walls, pretending to be pure and high above us

394
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,000
but the truth is Hyorin is nothing.

395
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,650
That is just annoying.

396
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,480
Do you have time tomorrow?

397
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,070
Let's have a game of polo tomorrow.

398
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,850
OK.

399
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,720
Hye Jung Goong has entered the Palace, she is visiting Her Majesty now, Mama.

400
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,990
Hye Jung Goong?

401
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,850
Yes.

402
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,730
How is the King's health?

403
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,540
Right now... it's much better.

404
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,200
That's good...
then where is he feeling unwell?

405
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,100
Dizziness caused by neuroglycopenia.
It's a form of head dizziness.

406
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,790
So it's dizziness.

407
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,010
He needs to rest more to prevent tiring.

408
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,850
Exactly.

409
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,340
He has been reading late
into the night recently.

410
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,250
Reading the old saying books often.

411
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,100
No matter what we say,
he just doesn't listen.

412
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,680
The late King was also the same, when he fell ill because of the books..

413
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,080
Didn't he once said that he's all well again when the books are around?

414
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,150
That's right, the King is exactly like that.

415
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,970
The Queen must be very worried.

416
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,620
Yes.

417
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,280
To take care of the King, she rushes from the Royal kitchen to the Royal hospital.

418
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,120
It is really tiring for her.

419
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,540
The Crown Prince did teach
the Crown Princess well.

420
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, Mama.

421
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,190
Mama, you hit it.

422
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,790
Your back is much more flexible now Mama.

423
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:45,950
Is it so?

424
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,460
I think it must be the yoga I've been doing.

425
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,570
A few simple steps can allow
the body to become to better.

426
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,130
Hye Jung Goong practiced yoga and she managed to get cured of a serious disease.

427
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,560
Not only did her body get healthy, Hye Jung Goong has the body of a 20-year-old's.

428
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,700
I am sorry.

429
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,500
I am still not used to this yet.

430
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,720
Horseback Polo used to be one of the exam topics in ancient times for the herding Officers.

431
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,860
You would not qualify if
you were to enter the exam.

432
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,010
You would have fallen off the board.

433
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,820
I know.

434
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,240
Reflect.

435
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,810
What did you just say?

436
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,700
I learned this from Chaegyung.

437
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,270
It seems to be used in such a situation.

438
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:05,230
If there is a chance, I would like to allow the Palace maids to learn yoga as well.

439
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,770
What does the Queen think about this idea?

440
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,520
I'm sorry, Mama.

441
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,880
Following the methods prescribed by the Royal medical centre,

442
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,210
the preparation of the medicine for the King would not allow any more free time.

443
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,610
Oh is it? I see.

444
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,320
Mama.

445
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,320
I would like to speak of the matters regarding Hye Jung Goong entering the Palace.

446
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,650
Yes, please speak.

447
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:41,850
Whatever it is, it's wearing clothes that doesn't suit the Palace's atmosphere.

448
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:49,170
Yoga is also not suitable
to be practiced in the Palace.

449
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,680
Is it?

450
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,130
The passed kings feared that the people might be overly obsessed with it.

451
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,980
So, they promoted reading books for quiet entertainment and hobbies.

452
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:00,990
Take polo for example, it was once very popular with the Royal family and the public.

453
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,990
But the first King was worried that people were going to be too addicted to it.

454
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,720
So, he advised the people to do reading, deep thinkings and other kinds of quiet activities.

455
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,410
Because of his efforts, the polo heat began to disappear slowly.

456
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,310
That's right.

457
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:20,310
I will be careful with that.

458
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,650
Overboard and not enough.

459
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:31,360
Going too far is as bad as not going far enough and have the same effect.

460
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,150
Jeonha! Jeonha! Seja Jeonha!

461
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,020
Are you okay?

462
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,770
Jeonha!

463
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,520
Yul Goon, are you okay?

464
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,710
Blood..!

465
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,800
How??

466
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,280
Does it hurt??

467
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,680
It's okay.

468
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,150
Are you okay?

469
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,050
Is it okay not to go to Shin?

470
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,660
He has so many people around him.

471
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,130
What was wrong with you back in school?

472
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,120
You were like a stranger.
I was shocked.

473
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:20,510
Maybe it's because Cinderella and the Prince are so happy together, that's why I acted like that.

474
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,430
I thought... your expression...
it looked so sad.

475
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:37,380
And perhaps it's because of
that I ran to you just now.

476
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,550
What's wrong?

477
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,150
It can't...

478
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,050
It can't be him.

479
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,060
It tells of a story of a man...

480
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,630
One day he planted an oak tree
on a plot of infertile land.

481
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:03,990
After a long period of time, the seedings finally became trees.

482
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,090
Wow, that's so cool.

483
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,090
It maybe insignificant in size
but it can change the world.

484
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,100
A story that can allow the world to become a more beautiful place.

485
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,160
Shin Goon.

486
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,220
Your Highness, are you in?

487
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,710
Ohh, he looked so cute when he was young.
So cute.

488
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,770
This looks so old.

489
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,050
What is this place?

490
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,680
It's a wall made up of hanging paper.

491
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:48,970
You scared me.

492
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,850
You scared me.

493
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,350
Are you okay?

494
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,850
Did you get hurt anywhere?

495
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,970
You really got hurt? Does it hurt?

496
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,470
Who gave you permission to come in here?

497
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,300
I knocked on the door but no one answered.

498
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,290
And this door opened by itself...

499
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,100
Get out!

500
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,200
Didn't you hear me?

501
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,340
GET OUT!!!

502
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,830
This year's best author,
Go Yeong Ok, please step forward.

503
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:03,520
In Hwa 14th Year 2nd Month, Great Republic of Korea's King.

504
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,750
-Thank you for your efforts.
-Yes, thank you.

505
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,820
Please provided us with even
better works in the future.

506
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,530
Next is the award for Calligraphy.

507
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,120
AbbaMama.

508
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:41,880
How can the King disregard the instructions of the Royal medical centre?

509
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:47,150
He needs rest to recover.
That's definite.

510
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,710
He has been quite well recently, that is why we were careless.

511
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,440
This is really troubling.

512
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,570
That's why I have something to say.

513
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,780
Let the upcoming trip to Thailand lead by the King be replaced by the Royal couple.

514
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,650
What does Mama think about that?

515
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,250
Did you ask the King what he thinks about this?

516
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,760
Yes, Mama.

517
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,770
He thinks this is a good idea.

518
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,360
But there is another problem.

519
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:31,300
For the Cloth Giving event, the British Royal, Prince William will visit Korea.

520
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,580
Oh, I see. What about it?

521
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:42,370
During his stay, we have organized a welcome ceremony in the Korea Royal family's way.

522
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,750
But there is no suitable person yet.

523
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,870
Furthermore, the King's body...

524
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,750
Yes.

525
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,950
We have no idea what to do.

526
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,320
Ah... what about Yul?

527
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,580
He grew up in England and
he is educated there.

528
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,100
So he would not have a language barrier.

529
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:17,320
Yes, but he just got back
to Korea not long ago...

530
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,440
It's like that.

531
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,450
How is the standard of
the Crown Princess' English?

532
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,890
To reply, I am sorry, Mama.

533
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:59,250
I'm afraid it is not good enough to handle overseas ambassadors, Mama.

534
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:08,500
If it is possible, let the Prince go to Thailand alone and she stays behind to handle Prince William.

535
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,830
That would have be perfect.

536
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:17,050
But if she messes up with her standard of English, it might make matters worst.

537
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,670
That's why I was thinking of letting one of the Royals handle this.

538
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,340
But her Majesty is thinking of letting Yul be in charge of this.

539
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,310
Hwi Sang Goon Mama?

540
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:46,570
The dizziness got better after treatment, but it got worse again now.

541
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,930
It seems that I do not understand
my body any longer.

542
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,010
I might worsen the condition if
I were to travel around.

543
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,890
No, AbbaMama.

544
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,120
The Crown Prince has helped me alot during this period of time.

545
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,380
There shouldn't be any problem handling the daily schedules.

546
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,230
So prepare for the trip to Thailand
with the Crown Princess.

547
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,010
I'm going to?

548
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,000
[Hey sisters. I am going to Thailand~
Jealous? I bet you girls are.]

549
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,690
There could be some problem bringing her.

550
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,790
Why? What are you doing?

551
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,960
During this time, as she was attending formal etiquette lessons, she missed a lot of school days.

552
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,460
So it will be slightly difficult if
we were to bring her along.

553
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,630
Is it?

554
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,030
It is a formal visitation and
also going as a student.

555
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,970
Excuse me.
I am very close with my teacher.

556
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,670
I can go pacify her.

557
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,460
Say something nice, she may...

558
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:12,660
Teacher? That's...

559
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,750
Also, Prince William's visitation
to Korea and our visitation to Thailand

560
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,580
lands during the same period. How are we going to solve this?

561
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,750
We haven't resolved that yet.

562
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,000
So for the Thailand visitation trip, the Crown Prince will go alone.

563
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,960
It's better that the Crown Princess
focus on school work.

564
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,180
Yes.

565
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,380
Have a nice trip.

566
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:03,000
And also, regarding the other day,
I am really sorry.

567
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,840
I will go to the Inner Palace first.

568
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,910
Yes, Jeonha.

569
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,900
How are you doing, Yul?

570
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,180
It'a nice to see you again.

571
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,900
Is Prince William your friend?

572
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,550
He is a brother (hyung).

573
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,330
Hyung?

574
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:47,940
Hyung.

575
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,520
Hyung?

576
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:49,220
Hyung.

577
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,190
Hyung~!

578
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,090
Am I just nothing to you?

579
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,250
What is wrong with you?

580
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,900
I never once felt like
I was your girlfriend.

581
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,270
I like Shin.

582
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,130
He is always there, beside me, seeing each other everyday, chatting.

583
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,660
This maybe funny.

584
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,410
But if I were to have met you earlier, perhaps I would have fallen for you instead.
