1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,790
Episode 14

2
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,300
So have you found out what's going on?

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,220
How are the two doing?

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,680
I think it was a success.

5
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,030
Really?

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,710
I think we worried to much...

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,790
Yes, I think we did. Well it's good now.

8
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,490
Yes. Now I just have to wait for my great grandson.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,400
Tonight, everyone was happy.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,250
But by tomorrow, the Palace will be blow with the "winds of blood".

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,660
Now everything will return to my son Yul.

12
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,080
99 Mu Gung Hwa...
[*Mugunghwa/Hibiscus is the national flower of Korea*]

13
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,150
100 Mu Gung Hwa...

14
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,830
100 times.

15
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,250
You can really be sleeping at a time like this, huh?

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,500
She must be the Sleeping God.

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,760
1 Mu Gung Hwa...

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,530
2 Mu Gung Hwa...

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,030
There's no end...

20
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,430
3 Mu Gung Hwa...

21
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,240
Mama, this is your servant.

22
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,980
I don't think they are awake.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,590
They should be really tired.

24
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,040
This time I didn't go on you.

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,340
You did.

26
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,410
When did I?

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,670
You were like this.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,220
Are you... wanting to do something?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,970
In your dreams!

30
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,170
I was just sleeping and
then I was just like that.

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,910
Why is your hand here?

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,070
Be quiet.
Just put your clothes on.

33
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,270
And wipe your saliva.

34
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,690
You know last night's incident...

35
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,980
It just happened somehow.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
Be quiet you beast.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,910
My first kiss was supposed to be done at a romantic place with a romantic boy.

38
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,670
Now it's all ruined.

39
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,640
You think touching lips is
called a kiss these days?

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
I only touched it for like 1 second.

41
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,860
Be quiet pervert!

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
I don't want to even walk with a person like you.

43
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,430
Hey!

44
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,450
Yul Goon?

45
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,450
What are you doing here so early?

46
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,700
I ran here as soon as the sun went up.

47
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,080
What's wrong? Are you sick?

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,380
You're okay right?

49
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,980
Nothing's wrong, right?

50
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,620
What do you mean something's wrong?

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,860
Of course nothing is wrong.

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,030
That's good.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,700
That's really good.

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,640
Yul Goon.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,810
Why are you suddenly...

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,590
What are you doing?!

57
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,000
Why?

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,290
Pretend you don't know?

59
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,150
I was just greeting her cause
I was happy to see her.

60
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,800
Is that so wrong that
you have to act this way?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,220
You were glad to see her...

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,700
Do you have to hug her so close?

63
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,700
She's still my wife.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Don't touch her without my permission.

65
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,900
If you're the future king's wife, act like one.

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,250
Don't act like any guy even a cousin of mine is okay to hang out with.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,040
What?

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,730
You really want to be hugged by a guy...

69
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,860
Why were you like that last night?

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,250
So.. should I ask my parents
to arrange another night for us?

71
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,580
I don't have time to joke around.

72
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,470
Then last night, could you have hugged me like you did with Yul?!

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,150
The problem is that you act so differently.

74
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,600
To me, you get so angry for touching your lips once.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,270
But to someone else,
you don't even get mad.

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,150
If we get divorce,
are you planning to run away with him?!!

77
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,580
Now I know why I felt so disgusted.

78
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,700
What?

79
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,190
I better go and wash my lips first.
Gosh, darn it.

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,790
Darn it.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,660
Maybe I was too harsh.

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,130
Do you Royals get trained when you are young...

83
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,780
How to hurt someone's feeling?

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,360
How to make them feel bad about themselves?

85
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,240
You Royals are all the same.

86
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,640
You all are so mean!

87
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,150
Yul Goon, why did you do that this morning?

88
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,700
I think we should become closer.

89
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,280
So we can get married.

90
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,690
What? What does that mean?

91
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,180
I like you now.

92
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,980
At first, I thought I just wanted you because you were supposed to be mine.

93
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,180
But as time went by, I thought to myself...

94
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,700
"If I was your husband I won't act that way" and because of that thought..

95
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
I changed my mind and now I want to be the future king.

96
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,050
I... truly like you now.

97
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,800
Yul Goon. Don't joke around.

98
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,450
I'm not joking around.

99
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,040
It's too late now to think of
you as my cousin's wife.

100
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,350
I can't control my feelings anymore.

101
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,370
I know you are depressed lately.

102
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,210
But that doesn't mean you should say that.

103
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,700
I am different from Shin.

104
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,010
I won't leave you alone in the palace.

105
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,730
My grandpa arranged
the marriage for you and me.

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
When I was in the future king's place...

107
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,590
My father was the one who was willing to arrange the marriage.

108
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,880
What's your point of saying that now?

109
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,530
I am already married to Shin.
It can't be change.

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,950
Are you worried that you'll be criticized?

111
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't worry.

112
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,050
When you return to the palace as my wife...

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,140
You won't be criticized
because I'll be a powerful king.

114
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,260
What's wrong with me?

115
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,670
When did you come?

116
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,630
Your style has changed.

117
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,300
It looks different.

118
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,450
How do I look then?

119
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,120
What should I say,
more sophisticated and brave image.

120
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,700
Is it because you went into the palace?

121
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,180
Last night Shin and Chaegyung
had to share a room.

122
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,130
Although it was the adults decision,

123
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,170
I just thought you should know about this.

124
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,150
Are you serious?

125
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah.

126
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,210
I wanted to stop it but...

127
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,700
I had no power.

128
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,490
Thanks for telling me.

129
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,250
Do you still think you can get Shin back?

130
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,940
Isn't it hard now?

131
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,120
I haven't even started anything yet.

132
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,570
Why does Hyorin continue to tackle the Princess?

133
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,860
Exactly.

134
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,500
Why did she follow Shin
to Thailand and hurt Chaegyung?

135
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,300
It's just a news article.

136
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,130
It's serious though.

137
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,030
It's all that witch's fault.

138
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,180
To a witch like her,
we have to do something.

139
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,990
Good thing we met you.
Did you see the news article about you?

140
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,680
Hey! Why don't you stay away from the future king?

141
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,930
What are you trying to do by flirting with someone else's husband?

142
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
I don't have anything to say to you guys.

143
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,930
Yah! You think you are all that,
is being rich that good?

144
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,450
Did we say something wrong? Huh?

145
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,700
You!

146
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,140
Stop bugging someone else's husband and stop bothering Chaegyung!

147
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
It's none of your business.

148
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,100
This is Shin and my problem, so butt out!

149
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,150
If you make the Princess cry,
we will make you cry!

150
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,760
How can you do that to your own friend?

151
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,360
Don't act weak.
Hurry up and stand up!

152
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,330
Hey! what are you guys doing?

153
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,600
Are you okay?

154
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,230
Yes, Madam?

155
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,150
Mom's in the hospital?

156
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,770
Which hospital?

157
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,400
No.81 Building?

158
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay~ I'll be right there.

159
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,620
See, I told you...
You had to go to the hospital earlier.

160
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,000
It's okay,
it's just a small displacement of bones.

161
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,750
It will be all better after a surgery.

162
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,520
My friend's mother had the surgery and she was fine.

163
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,280
You got all worried right?

164
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,720
Did madam come by earlier?
What did she say?

165
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,120
Yah~  Madam is so nice to us.

166
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,000
She said don't worry and get well soon.

167
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,760
What if I don't awake after the surgery?

168
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,170
What am I going to do with my Hyorin?

169
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,450
Don't talk nonsense.

170
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,040
You have worked all your life,
and now you should rest.

171
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,150
Just wait. You will be alright.

172
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,440
How can I change Yul's feeling?

173
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,290
Ah~~ What am I supposed to do?

174
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,950
You're coming now.
You're late today.

175
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,280
Oh... I stopped by somewhere. Well...

176
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,350
Let's talk.

177
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,400
Don't grab me like that.

178
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,700
In the palace, don't you know that I have a higher status than you?

179
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,490
I am your cousin's wife and
I am the future king's wife.

180
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,670
So from now on,
be careful what you do and what you say.

181
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,010
You don't match up with shin.

182
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,990
You know how cold Shin is.

183
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,380
That is why I feel pity him.

184
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,030
And when I pity him,
I begin to understand him.

185
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,070
And as much as I understand him,
I become to like him.

186
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,400
I know one thing for sure.

187
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,710
At least,
Shin isn't greedy for something he doesn't have.

188
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,160
I'll go now.

189
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,190
Didn't you look after him in Thailand?

190
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,900
How can he go out like this?

191
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,660
I'm terribly sorry, Mama.

192
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,120
What's done is done.

193
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,260
First we should prevent these pictures from getting outside to others.

194
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,840
Yes Mama.

195
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,350
But how in the world did
this picture manage get in here?

196
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,400
Did you manage to find out?

197
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,790
They said that there hasn't been anyone from outside that came into the palace.

198
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,920
Then, does that mean these pictures walked into the palace?!

199
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,700
Mama, if someone was trying to threaten us...

200
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,310
They would have sent it to the media.

201
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,360
Then?

202
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,900
So we think of something else Mama...

203
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,600
Go ahead.

204
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:59,390
We think that it is someone
from inside the palace.

205
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,080
Inside the palace...

206
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,250
Should we send it to the news?

207
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,390
No, let's just wait a while.

208
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,570
I think it will be fun to see
what will happen in the palace.

209
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,400
But Mama...

210
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,220
They say that they are looking for people who sent the pictures.

211
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,600
They said they will find me with their ability. There's no chance.

212
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,230
Mama. These pictures can cause a problem to you.

213
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,550
Don't worry.

214
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,370
This is just like a hunting game.

215
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,790
Before you go into action, you give hints and make them nervous.

216
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,550
To tell you the truth,
a normal game is boring.

217
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,300
Giving your opponent time is a
good thing in a game.

218
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,840
But, Taeja Jeonha and the Queen,
they are not that naive.

219
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
That makes the game more amusing.

220
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,070
We will be able to see her
bowing her heads to us.

221
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,400
It would have been fun to see
their reactions to the picture.

222
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,450
You can go out.

223
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,980
Did you send those pictures to Chaegyung too?

224
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,730
I told you to leave it to me.

225
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,650
Mom! It's not the right time to show the pictures.

226
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,700
Then when are we going to do it?

227
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,450
Who are you trying to fool?

228
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,050
You think I don't know that you are scared that Chaegyung will get hurt?!

229
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,700
Just forget about her.

230
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,500
She is already the future king's wife.

231
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,910
It doesn't matter, they can get divorce.

232
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,450
Yul... are you thinking..

233
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,050
Since I was young,
I did everything you wanted me to do.

234
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,090
But it's the first time I have something I want,
and that's her.

235
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,890
It's too late for me to give up on her.

236
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,490
You... Do you want to see your mom die?

237
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,760
Where did you get these?

238
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,370
I told them not to bring these here.

239
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,850
Are you going somewhere?

240
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,070
Yes. I am going to go to the palace.

241
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,190
Why? Is there something wrong at the palace?

242
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,560
What could be wrong?

243
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,510
I just want to go see Grandma and mom.

244
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,930
When you go back,
tell Grandma that I am fine.

245
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,520
Because she will be worried about me.

246
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes Father.

247
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,430
So go and get some rest.

248
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,050
Don't look at books no more.

249
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Okay. Go safely.

250
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,210
Yes. I will be back safely.

251
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,860
Hey hey~ those books...

252
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,920
I am going to take these books.

253
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,400
How can you be so irresponsible?

254
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,700
As a Crown Prince,
how can you let this to happen!??

255
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:09,250
Hwang-hu. I think he realized his mistakes already. Let's not scold him anymore.

256
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,370
This is not a simple problem.

257
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,570
This is about the reputation of the crown prince.

258
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,360
Just thinking about this incident getting outside...

259
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,730
It makes me feel more miserable.

260
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,740
We can't change the past.

261
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,400
But what will be in the future is
what we can look ahead.

262
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,250
Taeja.

263
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,050
Yes HalmaMama.

264
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:44,150
These pictures, you surely must never show them to Bingung.

265
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,280
Understand?

266
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,400
Yes.

267
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,640
Then you may leave now.

268
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,490
He was never a bad child when he was young.

269
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,090
But these days I don't know what he's thinking.

270
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,500
You guys told me to come to
the palace immediately.

271
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,860
So I thought a bomb exploded or something.

272
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,800
That would have been a big problem.

273
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,360
Just believe in Shin.

274
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,010
In other countries,
a kiss like this is just a greeting.

275
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,190
When I was traveling,
I was greeted like that too.

276
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,040
Hmm?

277
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,860
And... it didn't feel all that bad.

278
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,400
Really?

279
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,750
Gongju.

280
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,050
Taeja is going to be the future King.

281
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,480
I do know that, Mother.

282
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,760
I think someone is trying to play a game.

283
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,700
What do you mean by a game?

284
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,080
If that person wanted money they would have, of course, sent it to the news office.

285
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,370
But they send it directly do the palace.

286
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,750
That means money is not their objective.

287
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:14,090
Usually a game is done till
the end to find out the true winner.

288
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,280
If not, that person may be happy to see us shocked by the pictures.

289
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,680
So that's why we shouldn't be shocked.

290
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,390
We should be calm.

291
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,970
Who could have done this?
Thailand paparazzi?

292
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,750
I don't think so, Jeonha.

293
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,770
If they did, they wouldn't have sent the pictures first.

294
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,270
They would have sent their favors that they want.

295
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,740
But it's not,
so I think they have a different objective.

296
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,700
Then what should we do?

297
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,350
We will look at the list of people in this palace.

298
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:18,040
If Shin knew that Hyorin's situation and still liked her...

299
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,920
That means those two
must really like each other.

300
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,230
Then Yul Goon might be right.

301
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,350
Mama.

302
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,450
Tae-Hwang Mama has arrived.

303
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,400
Please ask her to come in.

304
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,060
The Queen must be feeling really unhappy, right?

305
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,820
There's a saying that bad things
spread a thousand miles..

306
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,700
Where did you hear that from?

307
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,700
There's no saying that your eyes will be blind-folded or ears will be blocked by just sitting there, right?

308
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,850
Speaking of it...

309
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,450
How are you going to handle it after such a shameful thing is being exposed?

310
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,560
How can the Royal family be shaken because of such a small matter?

311
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,400
It must be some dirty tricks played by some mean-hearted people.

312
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,080
That's very fortunate, of course.

313
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,400
But what if these photos are spread outside.

314
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,110
Then, won't it be too difficult to handle?

315
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,420
According to what HaeMyung Princess said...

316
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,750
Is really there a person
who is playing games with us?

317
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,290
Games?

318
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,320
HaeMyung has only made some casual remarks.

319
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,550
Is that so?

320
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,630
Then, the Prince should also
do some reflecting as well.

321
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,360
If the namesake of the Royal family is brought to shame because of the Prince's bad behavior...

322
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,500
Then that won't be too good at all,
isn't it so?

323
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,800
She looks sad today.

324
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,530
Chaegyung, let's go out and draw.

325
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,760
Yah let's do that Mama~

326
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,260
Chaegyung, what's wrong?

327
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,290
I'm sorry, but I want to be alone.

328
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,540
I am confused right now.

329
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,460
Are you not going to talk to me anymore?

330
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,410
It's hard to be comfortable around you now.

331
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,330
Are you hurt because of what I said?

332
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,590
I've said more harsher things to you.

333
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,890
Maybe I surprised you.

334
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,150
But if I didn't tell you,
you would never know.

335
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,590
Why do you like me?

336
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,020
You said that you felt bad for Shin...

337
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,540
And then you understood him...

338
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,620
and then you liked him right?

339
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:43,090
Well it's the same for me.

340
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,100
After I knew you..

341
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:55,560
I worried about you and missed you.

342
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,150
And now it hurts.

343
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,810
Yul Goon.

344
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,520
I was always independent.

345
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,060
I never gave my hand to anyone and no one gave a hand to me.

346
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:34,230
But you.. you gave me a hand..

347
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,250
Because you're a friend.

348
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,050
You are true to everyone.

349
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:54,330
One day, a girl named Shin Chaegyung came into my heart...

350
00:32:54,550 --> 00:33:01,220
and I didn't know when
my heart opened for you.

351
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,990
I'm sorry, but I can't accept you.

352
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,150
I never asked you to accept me.

353
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,330
I never asked for your feelings to come to me.

354
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,410
But I just don't want you to push me away.

355
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,040
But you will get hurt.

356
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,960
I don't want Yul Goon to get hurt because of me.

357
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,070
If you push me away...

358
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,040
I will get hurt.

359
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,810
Just act the way you did before.

360
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,320
I will wait till your feelings come to me.

361
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,320
Yul Goon...

362
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,900
I won't express my feelings for you anymore.

363
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,950
So I just want to stay friends with you.

364
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:21,150
I don't think your feelings will change that fast.

365
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:29,080
But when I'm sad,
I'm happy that you're there for me.

366
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,690
Should we skip school?

367
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,170
You look like you want to cry.

368
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,500
Are you ready?

369
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,980
One, two, three.

370
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,770
Shin Goon is so mean...

371
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,420
So mean...

372
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,210
I'm sorry.
I can't do anything for you.

373
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,220
What's that? The song...

374
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,750
Ta-da!

375
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,160
Where did you get it?

376
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,720
I can afford one.

377
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,760
This matter has been settled with the help from the Cultural festival administrative bureau.

378
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,140
This is the project proposal for the ongoing Ancient book research at the Governments' safe keeping office.

379
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,050
We are still carrying on with
what have decided as the...

380
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,290
World inheritance United Nations Educational Cultural Organization.

381
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,300
The research includes "Sung Jung Won's dairies" which was contributed

382
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,390
by the Literary intelligentsia as individual literature..

383
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,420
I'm sorry, Jeonha.

384
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,740
I have rushed things too much because of the over pile up work.

385
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,690
Please rest for a while,
while I serve you herbal tea.

386
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,090
There's no need, let's just continue.

387
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,770
What do I do? I think it's stuck.

388
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,860
Come here.

389
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,870
I'm just kidding.

390
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Thank's Yul Goon.

391
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,300
Because of you I had fun and because of this we didn't catch too much attention.

392
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,950
We should go now.

393
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,520
You go first.

394
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,960
Why?

395
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,150
Last time we got in trouble
when we went to the forest.

396
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,920
I will go on my own from here.

397
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,150
Will you be okay?

398
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,150
Yeah, I have this.
Can you give this to me?

399
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,950
Sure.

400
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,880
Ooh.. it's Kang Hyun.
I'll see you in the palace.

401
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,820
Hey Kang Hyun ah~
I'm at the amusement park..

402
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,220
I'll go back after awhile.

403
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,600
Isn't that the Bingung Mama?

404
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,050
Oh~ that sure looks like her.

405
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,250
Let's go ask.

406
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,820
Um.. by the way,
are you the Crown Princess?

407
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,610
No no~ I hear that a lot.

408
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,000
Do I look like the Crown Princess?

409
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,150
I look prettier right?

410
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:05,920
It used to be normal to walk in the crowded streets with my friends.

411
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,440
But now,
I think I am looking at a whole different world.

412
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,950
Just like looking at a picture...

413
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,480
We have to tell the elders.

414
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,780
We should wait a bit longer,
Choi Sang Gong.

415
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,130
What if something goes wrong?

416
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,990
They are already worried about other stuff.

417
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,860
Let's just wait a bit longer.

418
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,360
What's wrong?

419
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,740
I just asked what is wrong.

420
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,290
I am sorry, Jeonha.

421
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,250
Right now,
we can't get in contact with Bingung Mama.

422
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,150
What?

423
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,970
Since when?

424
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,740
It's been a while.

425
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,390
We are looking for her right now.

426
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,230
Don't inform the elders first.

427
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,870
It's me Shin.

428
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,800
Where is Chaegyung?

429
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,050
She's not back yet?

430
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,970
If you went out together,
you should bring her back.

431
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,200
Where the heck did you leave her?

432
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,900
She said she would come later.

433
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,020
Do you think something
bad happened to her?

434
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,960
I have to look for her.

435
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,190
You!

436
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,320
It seems like you keep on forgetting that Chaegyung is the Crown Princess.

437
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,930
Like the night she and I shared the room,

438
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,380
and today at school you treat her as if you're more than friends.

439
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,050
Be careful from now on.

440
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,470
If you're not careful,
Chaegyung is going to get hurt.

441
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,460
Do you think you have
the right to say that?

442
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,980
What do you mean?

443
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,870
Think about it.

444
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,550
We still haven't found out anything yet.

445
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,390
How could such an unhappy thing happen?

446
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,910
We can only counter-attack when we know what the motives are for that person to be sending those pictures.

447
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,590
Don't worry too much.

448
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,840
Until now there's still no reactions from the press.

449
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,490
So, that person must still not be in a hurry to announce it to the public.

450
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,230
Then, are we just going to
sit here without doing anything?

451
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,890
Although I won't know how things are going to develop from now...

452
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,670
But there will always be a way to solve it, no matter how big the problem might be.

453
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,840
You still can't contact her?

454
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,940
I'm sorry Jeonha.

455
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,370
Judging from the Princess' disappearance, the blow she got isn't small at all.

456
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,060
It seems like the upper Palace
has blocked all the news.

457
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,120
They should.

458
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,610
That smart crown Prince
wouldn't be on the news, of course.

459
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,460
Finally the relationship between the two of them is starting to fall apart.

460
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:04,340
From what I see, she's not a person who can adapt to living in such a 'dry' Palace life.

461
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,650
Speaking of which,
I have to use those photos once more.

462
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,230
What other ideas do you have?

463
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,820
It won't be fun if I win too easily.

464
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,870
Isn't that so?

465
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,470
Are you going to go look for Chaegyung?

466
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:37,910
Yes.

467
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,370
If you find her, call me immediately.

468
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,710
I don't want to.

469
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,020
Are you STILL going to act this way?!

470
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,610
You are always making Chaegyung cry.

471
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,540
But I want her to make her smile.

472
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,050
I caught it.

473
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,880
Hold on tight.

474
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,370
Thank you, Crown Princess.

475
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,450
This is for you, sister.

476
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,640
You're giving it to me?

477
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,710
Yes.

478
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,410
Thank you.

479
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,880
Go far.. Far away...

480
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,050
Did you see Chaegyung at school?

481
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,200
Did you call me just because of that?

482
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,400
She might call you because of those pictures,
so call me.

483
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,300
I have to go find her.

484
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,520
I've never seen your face so worried before.

485
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,730
Are you that worried because of that girl?

486
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,360
I am worried.

487
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,860
Do you have to make a face that looks like you would die worrying about that girl?!!

488
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,150
And in front of me too?!?!

489
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,270
She is the Crown Princess,
my wife as well.

490
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,290
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

491
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,560
Look more closely.

492
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,610
I understand.

493
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,500
Anyway, I don't think she is in the Palace.

494
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,550
Maybe she has gone back home?

495
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,770
She is more filial than she looks.

496
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,880
So she won't do things
to make her parents worry.

497
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,480
I just knew you will be here.

498
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,930
It's really lucky that nothing happened to you.

499
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,960
Sorry, I came in without permission.

500
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,170
Wait a sec!

501
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,350
The second video camera in the center.
Please rewind it once more and look.

502
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,820
Yes, I got it.

503
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,300
Where is that place?

504
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,850
That's the route to the myung sung gak area.

505
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,300
Myung Sung Gak area?

506
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,020
Yes.

507
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,600
Where did you go all by yourself?

508
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,880
Just to the world I used to live in.

509
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,150
What?

510
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,720
The world I lived in when I wasn't Shin Chaegyung the Crown Princess.

511
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,740
I just wanted to see the world where normal girl Shin Chaegyung used to live in.

512
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,180
So how did it feel to see it again?

513
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:12,750
Now I can't talk to people comfortably or meet people comfortably.

514
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:19,560
Now that I live in the Palace,
I think I'm a whole new person.

515
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:29,900
I just want to do whatever I want, to eat whatever I want to eat, to go wherever I want to go, and to live like that.

516
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,500
but I guess I can't do that anymore right?

517
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,960
You can live like that.

518
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,040
Now that you live in the Palace,
you have less freedom right?

519
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,860
If I have you, I can breathe.

520
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,310
If you can't stand the Palace, do you want to run away together?

521
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,430
What?

522
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,860
If you want, I can give up everything.

523
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,720
If you want and if you feel comfortable...

524
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,320
I am always ready to give this up.

525
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,370
I'm gonna go now.

526
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:31,010
But if I want something...

527
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,010
What's wrong with you?!?!

528
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,010
What are you doing!

529
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:54,210
I told you, if you found the BingungMama, you're supposed to contact me immediately, you got that!?

530
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,920
He didn't know I was here.

531
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,010
Shut your mouth!

532
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,800
Yah~~! Let go~!

533
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,420
What's your problem?

534
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,500
Be quiet!!

535
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,540
Don't get mad!

536
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,620
If you really want to a divorce...

537
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,300
I'll let you.

538
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,000
But you're the one who always talk about it first, you bad guy!

539
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,070
Because I can certainly live without you.

540
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,590
Can we...
Can we just stay like this for a minute?

541
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,520
I'm sorry, that'll never happen again.

542
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,640
Leave!

543
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,400
What are you all doing?!?

544
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,050
The Queen is leaving!!

545
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:09,330
That self-centered crown Prince, I am sure he is suffering now.

546
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,420
I am also at fault.

547
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,390
The dethroning of the Crown Prince
is just a matter of time.

548
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,180
Uh~~ what to do?

549
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,580
Shin Chaegyung.

550
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,040
Please give us an affectionate pose.
