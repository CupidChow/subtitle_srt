1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,090
Episode 5

2
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,700
It's me.

3
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,950
Yeah. I'm eating right now.

4
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,500
Nope. She's not here.
Please continue...

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,960
Really? That's good

6
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,700
Yeah. Okay.

7
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,790
Was that Hyorin?

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,140
Yeah.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,900
But, that's not necessary.

10
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,000
So what, you're speaking to your friend.
It's alright..

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,610
What are you saying?

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,750
It just seemed like you were eyeing me while you were speaking on the phone.

13
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,050
Eyeing?
Surely you're not thinking I have to do that.

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,750
Whether I'm married or not...

15
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,750
I will pick up all the phone calls that I want to pick up without thinking what's on anyone's mind..

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,690
The reason that I looked at your face...

17
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,700
It was because there is rice,
stick on your cheek.

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,350
And you, wasn't that a bit harsh?

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,500
Even if you married me to move to Cheong Duk Palace as a condition.

20
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,190
But what am I to you,
if you say that in front of me?

21
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,550
I'm just like the goods that's use for trades.

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,780
I'm feeling so unhappy over it.

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,990
Do you even have the right to say that?

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,100
What do you mean?

25
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,180
To put it in first place,
you married me because of money.

26
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,050
I heard that you begged the Queen to solve your family's financial problems..

27
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,350
Isn't that marrying me for money?

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,670
Ah.. Please don't misunderstand.

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,260
I heard the adults talking
about it coincidentally..

30
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,070
I heard that you were a simple-minded girl.

31
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,750
I never knew that you are
so smart in calculations as well.

32
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,330
I heard that you have already received those documents from the royal accountant.

33
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,760
How do you feel,
looking at your bank accounts?

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,150
You're speaking really mean.

35
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,580
Why? Are you angry?

36
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,710
There's no need for that and
just eat your dessert.

37
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:19,100
It seems like you're really mad ...
why? Are you really so angry?

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,350
If it possible,
I feel like twisting your mouth off.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,450
Fine, the truth is that I married the hated you because of money. Are you satisfied now?

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,900
Yes, I feel that I had done well when I looked at the accounts book..

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,610
Yeah.. while seeing the book keeping I thought I could figure out something.

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,780
Since you have already labeled
me as a gold digger..

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,700
I might as well take your properties as well and help my poor family.

44
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,740
You know Lee DongWan from
"The Trap of Youth"?

45
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,050
He's my role model from now on.
Do you know that?

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,190
Meet a good husband and catch hold of him.

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:13,550
To upgrade my status and then be a bad woman who plots to take everything away from him.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,310
You have to be careful from now on.

49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,100
You bad hearted JERK!!

50
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,800
Bad guy...  Really a bad guy...

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,280
Should we go in now?

52
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,700
What should we do? Stop it...

53
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,010
Mama, where are you going?
Go to the western hall right away.

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,210
I'll be back quickly.

55
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,800
Jeonha, can I tell you today's schedule?

56
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,700
Do you know what "The Trap of Youth" is?

57
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,200
Yes? um ...
it's that TV drama from a few years ago.

58
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,750
Why are you asking about
this so suddenly?

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,250
I might as well do anything I want since we are going to divorce eventually..  You dreadful man..

60
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,440
Ugh, I'm getting angry.

61
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,400
Oh my...

62
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,240
So it was like that Yul is
the Hwi Sung Goon.

63
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,530
According to the Law of the Imperial Household,

64
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,160
All the other Princes besides the Crown Prince have to live outside.

65
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,850
So that's why I don't live in
the Imperial Palace.

66
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,040
I can only come inside the Palace once a day to say my greetings.

67
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,870
Ah, that's right. I was thankful for last time.

68
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,350
Hm?

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,700
You gave me the chocolate and candy when I was receiving lessons on the Bride fetching event.

70
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,900
Chocolate? Candy?

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,770
Why are you so shy?

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,080
"The Trap of Youth"

73
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,020
What the classmates have been talking about?

74
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,560
Suddenly...
becoming the Crown Princess.

75
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,530
I get nervous that they'll curse at me.

76
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,270
When three girls meet, a hole appears on the back of my head.

77
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,070
Just, well, how the modest cat unequally rose up,

78
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,340
how that face could have possibly attracted that Crown Prince.

79
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,220
Nonstop that kind of talk.

80
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,990
Honestly...
you believe that nonsense, don't you?

81
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,550
Ah, what is that?

82
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,780
Although you are so likeable
because you are cute.

83
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,230
Nevertheless you are not Shin's type.

84
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,470
Oh? Who is it?

85
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,610
Is it Choi Sang Gong?

86
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,750
Hello?

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,300
Where are you right now?

88
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,300
Is it Shin?

89
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,350
Why? Are you calling to affirm whether or not I stole something?

90
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,550
Already having lover's quarrels?

91
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,540
It seems like you guys
are having a fun life.

92
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,440
Having a fun life?

93
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,550
Don't you have to go?

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,400
I don't have to go.

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,110
Hurry up and go.

96
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,080
He'll be throwing his temper
if you let him wait.

97
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,400
Where have you been all this time,
Miss Lee DongWan?

98
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,830
That guy is really bad.

99
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,440
Why? He's the same as me...
married for money and all.

100
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,150
Stop saying that.

101
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,950
Now, I have a deep impression after watching it.

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,190
Actually, I'm thinking to invite you for dinner tonight. How about it?

103
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,310
You can invite a few friends over as well.

104
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,670
Are you fooling around with me right now?

105
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,300
Ah, go away!

106
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,080
I don't even want to see your face,
go away!

107
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,860
Hey, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

108
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,450
You want to go home, right?

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,080
Should I make it so that you can?

110
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,470
Or... should I invite your parents here?

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,750
Okay.

112
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,150
I'll decide after seeing
how you perform.

113
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,860
What did you say?!

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm already going crazy
just thinking of them.

115
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,010
Why must you say that I married you for money to make me angry!

116
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,400
And now, you are fooling around with
"I'll let you go home"?!

117
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,150
You are a bad guy! You're  bad.
You're really....

118
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:55,950
Up to here. The height of your bowing head is only right up to here.

119
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,250
Right, are you ready for tomorrow's test?

120
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
Test?

121
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,750
Kang Hyun ah~

122
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,310
Lee Kang Hyun!

123
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,560
Kang Hyun Ah~

124
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:48,350
Hwang TaeJaeBin Mama, you should have studied earlier on. aigoo.

125
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,450
Okay, stop. Release your hands.
Pass the test papers from the back.

126
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,470
I was talking on the phone.

127
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,320
That hurts..

128
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,950
Is it alright for the Groom
to stay here with us?

129
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,770
It's the most interesting part.

130
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
I really want to know.

131
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,750
Oh, Hyorin! Hello!

132
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,080
Jeonha.

133
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,040
We are unable to find Bingung Mama.
We can't find her.

134
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
We were waiting for her to come out after her classes were over but we cannot find her.

135
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,300
She didn't call us, either.

136
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,750
Thank you!

137
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,400
It's a perfect disguise... just as I thought they will never be able to identify me.

138
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,400
21st Century maiden!

139
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,080
What? How did he figure me out?
You're really great.

140
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,930
Hey. What is this?

141
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,750
Everyone can tell as long as they are humans, ok?.

142
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,060
Anyway, Yul ... let's eat rice cake.

143
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,750
Come this way~

144
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,190
Ee~ Split apart!

145
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,530
Hurry up and eat.

146
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,750
Why? Because you think it's dirty?

147
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,650
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I've never eaten this before.

148
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,950
What? Good heavens, is there such a preposterous teenager as this?

149
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,450
There is dduhkbohkee in the Imperial Palace too.

150
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,150
This is the first time seeing them this red.

151
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,700
You're very pitiful.

152
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,750
Here, eat it.

153
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,190
Hey, what's this formal talk with a friend from class? Friend, eat.

154
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,350
Eat your friend?

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,330
Hey, it hasn't been long since he came to Korea.

156
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,280
Drink this...

157
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,350
Does it taste weird?

158
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,140
Hwang TaeJaeBin Mama!
There's big trouble!

159
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,500
Really? Really?

160
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,650
What to do? What to do?

161
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,870
Shin Goon!!
What am I to do if you leave by yourself?

162
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,050
Your glasses!

163
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,970
Chess, Kendo, Kong min Gu, etc..

164
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,000
Arts and music education, she gives all her best to study them.

165
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,560
The only problem now is her literature.

166
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,750
It'll be a little difficult as she shows no interest in it from the start till now.

167
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,050
Nevertheless, does it make sense to say that she has not even got the Book of Filial Pity right?

168
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,900
Everything is my fault, Mama.

169
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,610
From now on, if she can't complete anything assigned to her..

170
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,890
You must make sure that she catches up even if you are to extend her lessons.

171
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,700
Yes, Mama. I will carry out your command.

172
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,550
Did you hear that my mom and dad are coming to the Imperial Palace today?

173
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,690
Yeah.

174
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,400
And so, could you help
me practice this?

175
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,080
As I don't know Chinese characters very well..

176
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,550
I have to finish this quickly so that I can see my mom and dad.

177
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,750
I don't think I can.

178
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,750
It's time to study at the Western Hall.
I have to go to the library.

179
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,550
Euuu~ malicious man!

180
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,920
Fine, I can also practice myself on my own.

181
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,750
I should have invited both of
you to the Palace earlier.

182
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm so impolite.

183
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,450
Yes. I'm the one that honored.

184
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,700
It is an honor that you have invited us here, even though you are busy.

185
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,240
Because we didn't teach her properly...

186
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,270
I inquire if my daughter has
been troublesome or a pain...

187
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,450
Lay those worries to rest.

188
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,090
Although she is often silly,
she is working very hard.

189
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,740
Ah, that's a relief.

190
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,900
The truth is that even though our child is not good with her studies, she has a good head.

191
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,670
Her abilities to adapt is rather strong..

192
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,820
Well, even if she were in an
airplane crash she'd survive...

193
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,650
and if she were to fall into a desert, she'll make kimchi out of cactuses.

194
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,620
Yes, she is a girl that always look on the bright side.

195
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,150
So what's the method of making her so spunky?

196
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,350
I am very curious.

197
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:15,600
Yes? Ah.. yes,
the method for her spunkiness? Oh that...

198
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,550
She had been breastfed until five years old.

199
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,750
She ate it heartily...

200
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,830
Bingung Mama! You are not permitted to use handphone in the middle of studying.

201
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,480
Excuse me, 30 minutes have passed.

202
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,150
I'll write it again after I see my mom and dad.

203
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,910
Only when you finished
what's assigned to you today.

204
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,450
Then, you allowed to rise from your seat.

205
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,050
Because it is Queen's order,
it cannot be broken.

206
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,850
Then, it's okay if I quickly write up to here?

207
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,550
Yes?

208
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

209
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,080
Yes, it's nothing.
We'll be back quickly. Yes.

210
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,400
Why is it taking her so long? And she didn't even call us. An hour has already passed.

211
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
Hey, Madam Lee...

212
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,080
Aren't you worried about your daughter?

213
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,750
Do you only like looking at
your increasing insurance sales?

214
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,940
Of course I like it.

215
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,080
Out of all of Korea's insurance agents, who else could have the King join in, besides me?

216
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,380
Ah, that's true.
You have such power of persuasion.

217
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,450
I bet you that you can even dead people buy insurance from you. You're great.

218
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,150
The face color of the King doesn't look too good. I have to present before it's too late.

219
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,500
Let's just go.
I have to stop by at the company.

220
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,000
What do you mean go?

221
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,770
Should we go meet Chaegyung?

222
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,710
They said she's studying. Let's go.

223
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,560
That's how we will help her.
We have to raise her to be strong.

224
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,450
But I want to see our Princess so much.

225
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,940
They said they'll send her next week.
You can see her then.

226
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,550
It's late, let's hurry up and leave.

227
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,010
Wait.. Just wait a while..

228
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,940
Aigoo, I already told you that it's late.

229
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Bingung Mama~  Please don't run.

230
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,390
Just wait a while,
I'll just take my presents and come out.

231
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,450
There will be big trouble if the Queen finds out.

232
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,820
Then keep it as a secret. Sssst...

233
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,300
Mom! Dad!

234
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,300
Chaegyung. After waiting, mom and dad are leaving.
Listen to your elders and study hard.

235
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,000
I've packed the kimchi that Chaegyung loves. Eat well. Love You.

236
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,050
What is this?

237
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,140
How can you just leave?

238
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,870
At least you should have called.

239
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:28,530
The Sang Gong unnie won't even let me use my phone and made me to finish my writings.

240
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,210
I want to see you so badly.

241
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't know... I don't know...

242
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,660
Mom and Dad...
you're so bad. Mom...

243
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,450
What kind of a son in-law are you actually?

244
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,250
Sending away mom and dad who came to see their daughter.

245
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,390
Just acting cool everyday.

246
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
I want to see Mom and Dad so badly.

247
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,990
We did not even know that they left first..
They didn't even call us, Mama.

248
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,900
Prince even said that you might be uncomfortable if he was around.

249
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,080
So he wanted to wait till you almost finish talking before appearing.

250
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,910
That's why we are here only now, Mama.

251
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,450
Instead of saying useless things, tell her the next schedule program.

252
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,350
Send that to their home personally, Officer Kim.

253
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,350
Yes, Jeonha.

254
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,040
What is the next program?

255
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,580
Excuse me. Hey!

256
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,780
What tune are you humming?

257
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,580
Do you still like Min Hyorin?

258
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,800
If our family kept declining the marriage
'till the end...

259
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,050
and we never got married...

260
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,350
Probably...
you would have married her, right?

261
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,080
Because she's the one you really like.

262
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:14,010
If that's the case, you'd probably have a happier look on your face than you do right now.

263
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,330
It seems like I've become an
obstacle between both of you.

264
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,880
So I feel some guilt towards her.

265
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:37,150
But... when I think that you could have married her, I feel even worse.

266
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,250
I'm weird, right?

267
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm going to the bathroom.

268
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,440
I wonder what kind of music
he listens to actually?

269
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,130
Huh!? There's no CD?!

270
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,030
There isn't a radio either.

271
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,350
What exactly did he hear?!

272
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,410
Then he listened to everything I said?

273
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,880
What to do? Ah, I'll go crazy!

274
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,450
Where are you going?

275
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,580
Nothing...

276
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,750
I'm so embarrassed!

277
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,760
What to do? What do I do?

278
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,650
He listened to everything you said and pretended that he didn't hear anything?

279
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,450
I'll go crazy.

280
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,650
From his expression,
I'm positive that he heard.

281
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,030
What can I do to make this better?

282
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,850
No ... it's possible that he didn't hear.

283
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,300
No, after seeing the way he smiled at me it's definite that he heard.

284
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,150
But then ... 'I like you' ...

285
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,300
... it's not like I confessed like that or anything.

286
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,450
Idiot! It's the same thing.

287
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,080
Is .. is that so?

288
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,750
You... must really like him.

289
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,450
Aigoo. you're the same as the main character of the book I'm reading.

290
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,750
Why must those people with contract and promised marriages..

291
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,700
Fall in love with each other in the end?

292
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,350
What kind of deep thinking are you doing?

293
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,560
You came to say your greetings
to the Great Queen?

294
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Right, I just found out today...

295
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,300
It's Shin's birthday next week.

296
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,720
Birthday?

297
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
You still didn't know?

298
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,150
There's a party at Royal family's
Resort in Jeju island.

299
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,260
And they were asking for me to attend.

300
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,030
What is this, the Crown Princess doesn't know anything about it?

301
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,120
The Crown Prince and his wife have arrived.

302
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,400
It's been a while.

303
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,050
Congrats, Crown Prince.

304
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,550
You came alone?

305
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,210
I came alone.

306
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,750
Yul came too.

307
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,550
You came?

308
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh~ You're dashing.

309
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,950
Is it to your liking?

310
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,170
We put in double effort for you this year.

311
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,050
Hey, but where did Hyorin go?

312
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,240
Hm.. oh here she comes.

313
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,200
Happy birthday to you.
Your Highness.

314
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,730
Just a moment.

315
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,770
By the way, who are those people?

316
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,510
They are the Royal relatives' children and they are Shin's friends.

317
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,030
They are mainly members of
the Horse riding club.

318
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,050
Oh I see.

319
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,010
Is she also one of the members of
the Horse riding club?

320
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,350
I think Shin brought her into the club last year.

321
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,700
Oh. I see.

322
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,780
Min Hyorin is the 'Ull-zzang' of our school.
*Ull-zzang = Beautiful, Handsome*

323
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
Ull-zzang?

324
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,150
I said her face is Ull-zzang.

325
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,240
It means that she is the prettiest.
Very pretty.

326
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,450
I see, so that's the meaning of Ull-zzang.

327
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,700
There is no end to learning. Yul Goon.

328
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,180
Always be happy whilst learning.

329
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,220
Hey 21st century girl! That's cool!

330
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,010
Hold on a sec.

331
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,330
Oh, Hae Young sshi.

332
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
Did you arrive safely?

333
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,520
No traffic?

334
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,010
The renovation is going to be finished up soon, this is so tiring.

335
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,900
It's all right.
Everything is quite finished.

336
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,780
Oh~ put that in the left side of the room.

337
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,790
And put that in the other room.

338
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,830
- There?
- Yes.

339
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,230
Hi Sir.

340
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,150
Oh Yul, a guest just arrived.
I will chat with you later okay?

341
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,290
Everything is prepared for the opening?

342
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,750
What's there to prepare?

343
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,490
For a place that's as small as a cat's forehead.

344
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,230
If the cat's forehead is this big,
how big must that cat be?

345
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,300
Then show me that cat.

346
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,450
This cat's forehead is really small.

347
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,470
You had been in England and you should know.

348
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,180
It's always the new of the Royals and their scandals that will make the best news.

349
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:31,860
Even though the heir to the throne is Prince Charles but Prince William is the 2nd heir to the throne.

350
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,020
This is how the English view it.

351
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,500
The power of the media can cause one to
lose a lot or gain a lot in this society.

352
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,090
In the 21st century, with the tight security,
there would not be any chance of an assassination.

353
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,950
Thus it is important to make use
of words in the media.

354
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,690
This is how it really works in the 21st century.

355
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,900
Is there a plan?

356
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,880
There is a detailed plan.
Everything is prepared.

357
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,750
Go this way please.

358
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,480
I am sorry.

359
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,720
Oh.

360
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,130
- It's been awhile.
- Yes.

361
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,860
I didn't have the chance to greet you,
there were too many people a while ago.

362
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,520
It's okay

363
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:29,660
Are you getting used to Palace life, Princess?

364
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,620
Yes? Just...

365
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,680
Hey, don't disturb them and just come here.

366
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,260
Can you eat all these, alone?

367
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,200
Yeah.

368
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,070
Let's eat.

369
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,810
It's Mocca flavored cake.

370
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,160
Shin, try this.

371
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,360
Wow.

372
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,080
But this camouflage is real tiring.

373
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,320
We are really turning into animals.

374
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,520
Look there.
It looks like a scene from a movie.

375
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,590
That..

376
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,630
Ouch

377
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,190
Isn't that alien Prince?

378
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,490
Where?

379
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,800
There.

380
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,200
Why is he here?

381
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,750
That's right! It's Hyo Ryul Crown Prince.
He's like a copy.

382
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,080
He must be his son for sure.

383
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,710
That's right. The first time we saw him, he just doesn't feel common.

384
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,460
Then he is really a Prince?

385
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,810
Be quite.

386
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,350
Who is that?

387
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,620
Who?

388
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,630
Run!

389
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,800
Wait a second.

390
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,190
I didn't drink this.

391
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,090
It's okay.

392
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,360
You will get used to this.

393
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,870
Where did Shin Goon go to?

394
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,270
Can't see him anywhere.

395
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,110
He didn't tell you?

396
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,170
He said he was tired and
he went for a Spa.

397
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,440
Spa?

398
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,150
Yul.

399
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,210
The others are looking for you over there.

400
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,140
Oh is it? Please wait here Chaegyung.

401
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,620
What? What?
What are they talking about?

402
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,830
This bunch of jerks.

403
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,360
I can't understand a word of English.

404
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,620
Chaegyung is looking for you.

405
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
You didn't tell her you are here?

406
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,870
It's her first party.
You should have stayed with her.

407
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,690
You are the Crown Prince and
she is the Crown Princess.

408
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,950
In events like this,
you should be together with her.

409
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,740
They claimed to be the
friends of the Crown Princess.

410
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,380
We haven't confirmed their identities yet.

411
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,720
Yes. Alright.

412
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,080
Why are you hiding and what were you doing?

413
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,360
Do you know who we are?

414
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,710
We are the Jisu Sesu.

415
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,000
I am Jisu.

416
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,480
And I'm Sesu.

417
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,340
We are the Jisu Sesu.

418
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,240
Don't you know who we are up to now?.

419
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,350
Please believe us.
We are the Princess' close friends.

420
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,150
Hey guys!!

421
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,260
Chaegyung!

422
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,310
Do you get leave of absence from school?

423
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,030
It's the Crown Prince's birthday.
It doesn't matter if we are absent or not.

424
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,820
How did you girls know and
come here in Jeju Island?

425
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,870
Don't you know the Palace mania?

426
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,400
Knowing the location of the Royal resort is just basic information.

427
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,550
We came here by plane.

428
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,190
We don't have single cent left now.

429
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,710
I came because I was worried about them, even though I didn't want to.

430
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,880
That's a lie!

431
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,060
Shall we go back now?
They are all waiting.

432
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,520
It's the presents opening ceremony, the Crown Princess can't be absent right?

433
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,220
Yes. Thank you.

434
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,480
You can bring your friends over too.

435
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,990
Really? Is that really possible?

436
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,750
Nothing is impossible.

437
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,060
We are all schoolmates after all.

438
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,170
But... is he really a Prince?

439
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,070
But how did you know?

440
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,440
It should be a secret.

441
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,710
We are the Royal fans.

442
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,240
We are the die-hard Royal fans.

443
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,210
Stay here, let's go.

444
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,900
Wow! This is  really good.
I want to get one too.

445
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,350
I want to go to...

446
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,960
Let's go to Switzerland tomorrow.

447
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,130
This is from Miss Min Hyorin.

448
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,160
Wow. It's an mp3 player.

449
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,750
It's the latest one.

450
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,970
That looks great.

451
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,640
Thank you.

452
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,080
What is this?

453
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,310
It looks like our school shoes design.

454
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,090
Oh! That's my present!

455
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,770
I designed the shoe myself.

456
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,940
I used the ancient flower
designs used in the Palace.

457
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,750
This is interesting.
Did you got it from some store?

458
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,420
What is this.
It look like it's everywhere shoes on the street

459
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,120
Hey Shin. Try it on.

460
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,170
Chaegyung.

461
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,080
I know. I will try to tell him.

462
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,240
How can the Crown Princess,

463
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,360
be so stingy and gave him a cheap pair of shoes?

464
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,440
That's right. My face went totally red.

465
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,610
That's totally embarrassing!
Embarrassing! Embarrassing!!

466
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,970
Do you girls know how much effort I put in that?

467
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,300
So the presents they gave are all that great?

468
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,940
It's the sincerity of the gifts that count.

469
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,370
Stop talking rubbish and lead the way.

470
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:20,200
That's right!
We want to give our presents to the Prince.

471
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,610
My friends prepared presents for you, Shin goon.

472
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,590
They are members of your fan club.

473
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,760
They liked you since they
were five years old.

474
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,400
Yes, your Highness.

475
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,520
I have waited for this day for a long time.

476
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,630
If I could just have a handshake with you,
I will live without regrets.

477
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,360
What did you say?

478
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,620
That's Hyorin's place.

479
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,470
That's not your place, Princess.

480
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:53,030
I am sorry.

481
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,990
I thought it was empty.

482
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:03,070
You sat on it like your seating on a train,
A style of an old lady.

483
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,670
And who is this?
She looks weird.

484
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,010
"That's Hyorin's place".

485
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,140
Oh my God that was embarrassing.

486
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,670
"That's not your place".

487
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,040
This is a completely rotting place..

488
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,970
We are stupid.
But ain't you a bigger fool?

489
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,610
Are you a candy?
why are you being so noble?

490
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,260
- I am not being noble.
- If not, then what?

491
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,580
You may think that Hyorin is the bad person here.

492
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,260
But in reality, the bad person here is me.

493
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,140
What do you mean by that?

494
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,800
Why is the Crown Princess a bad person?

495
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:05,060
Hyorin is Shin's girlfriend from the start.

496
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,320
She was even proposed to.

497
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,480
What did u say? proposed to?

498
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,950
The Crown Prince proposed to Min Hyorin?

499
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,380
No... That... It's nothing like that.

500
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,230
Anyway, it's like..

501
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,440
Min Hyorin understands Shin a lot.

502
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:34,100
What he likes, his mood.

503
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,640
But I know nothing about him at all.

504
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,450
I guess you can say that.

505
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,980
After looking at them,
they are quite compatible.

506
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,390
I think so too.

507
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,320
You see.

508
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:56,480
I am the bad person here,
because I tear them apart.

509
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,670
That's why I didn't want to
have any argument with them.

510
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,760
Then that's true.
You are the bad one here.

511
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,250
21st century girl and friends!

512
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,720
What are you all so miserable?

513
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,010
The party is no fun?

514
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,690
What is this! Yul Goon.

515
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,200
You think it's funny?

516
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,350
You two too!

517
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,130
I will clean it for you.

518
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,360
Throw it away.

519
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,660
Have you listened to it?

520
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,510
I haven't.

521
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,960
You can watch shows on it as well.

522
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,430
This is the first time i went to Jeju island,
How come we came back on the same day?

523
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,450
When the clock strikes 12 midnight,

524
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:53,440
the carriage will turn back into a pumpkin
and Cinderella becomes cinder girl again?

525
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,390
Hey!

526
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,640
I think you drank too much water
and you forgot about this.

527
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,010
An early greetings to the elders in the morning
is the most important task in our schedules.

528
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,750
Remember?

529
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,020
I forgot all about that.

530
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,440
Tomorrow is a Sunday and I cant even sleep in late.

531
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,750
Since I can't sleep in at all tomorrow,
then I might as well don't sleep at all.
