00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,730
Episode 13

2
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,700
Mama.

3
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,420
Bingung Mama, there's an order from the Great Queen for you to come to her resting place.

4
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,410
Right now?

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,300
Oh~ Welcome, Bingung.

6
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,840
After getting out of the Palace and coming to this place,

7
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,270
although it may be brief,

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,230
my heart feels very refreshed.

9
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,450
How are you feeling?

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,240
Me too, Mama.

11
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,340
So, without notifying the people,

12
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:46,760
I was thinking of going out for some fresh air together.

13
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,650
The Prince already borrowed a car from a guy he knows,

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,950
so what better opportunity could there be than this?

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,170
However, Mama...
then the royal family law...

16
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,460
Who cares about the law in this situation.

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,190
It seems like the maids have taught her very well since the Princess is worried about the law.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,910
The truth is that if you don't get caught for breaking the law,

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,150
the feeling of breaking the law is a great sensation.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,150
For people who haven't experienced it,
they wouldn't know the feeling.

21
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,080
Then, HalmaMama, you've done it before?

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,020
Don't ask questions like that and just go on.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360
What do you think, Bingung?

24
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,040
Mama...

25
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,600
Huh?

26
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,430
You can't just sing like how ever you want.
This song is "trot".

27
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,330
Ah~ That's right.

28
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:35,210
The person who cried for not forgetting about the abandoned lover.

29
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,490
The depressed person waited in a room while playing the guitar...

30
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,950
Mama...

31
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,580
Huh?

32
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,430
You can't do it like that.

33
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,760
You put a lot of emotions but you need to sing it tenderly.

34
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,500
Then you try.

35
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,670
Whenever it's raining I think of this person.

36
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,210
Woohoo!

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,710
The quiet person..

38
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,470
In my opinion,

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,470
it looks like you're not that great either.

40
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,980
In this situation,
it would be nice if my grandson did something.

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,430
Grandson?

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,550
Yes.

43
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,870
A long time ago, in front of me, he danced and played around and he was so cute.

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,330
Those days were the best.

45
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,170
The small wheat and big wheat are growing..
The small wheat and big wheat..

46
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,640
When you were young,
you used to do body motions, too.

47
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
Mama, but that's a little...

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,140
Woooo!!

49
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,830
The farmer planted seeds...

50
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,660
The farmer planted seeds?

51
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,610
Mama, I can't do this. I don't want to do it.

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,920
I'll try it with him.

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,830
I think I know it a little.

54
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,380
Okay.

55
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,310
Ready, go!

56
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,180
Come out! Me too.

57
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,480
Ready, go!

58
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,100
King Sung Ju, please come here too..

59
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,140
Before with the Great Queen, Plants the seeds....we went to the Teddy Bear Museum.

60
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,970
We saw Alfred's friends displayed over there.

61
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,220
There are a lot more older compared to Alfred.
I have always been suspecting..

62
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,720
And now, I remember it again.

63
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,920
Why does Shin Goon always keep the ummatched to you, Alfred by your side?

64
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,120
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.

65
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,770
When I was 5 years old,
the former King gave it to me.

66
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,420
The former King?

67
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,240
He said that Queen Elizabeth gave it to
him to give it to the grandchildren.

68
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,430
I'm not sure if it's the truth or not.

69
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,130
It must be true.

70
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,160
It doesn't matter if it's true or not..

71
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,690
because it's very special to me.

72
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,940
I was five years old when Yul's dad passed away,

73
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,830
and we moved from the private house to the Palace.

74
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,000
The time, I became the Crown Grandson,

75
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,930
he felt sympathy towards my fear in the Palace,

76
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,620
that's when he came with the bear and told me the story.

77
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,630
Shin, this bear will be your good friend.

78
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,210
After that, the bear became my other half.

79
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,810
Whenever I talk to him, everything becomes better..

80
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,050
Because he knows more things about me than I do myself.

81
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,820
He must be really lonely.

82
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,940
It seems like the bear is his only friend.

83
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,970
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,910
To me, there's no such thing as secrets.

85
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,500
The whole world knows my secret.

86
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,850
It seems like nothing,

87
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,570
but I wish there was something that only I knew about.

88
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,830
Anyway, it does concern Hyorin, you still can't be able to explain it to me immediately?

89
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,790
Then how about this?

90
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,160
Are you really going to quit being the Prince?

91
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm not stupid to joke around like that.

92
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,460
Don't quit.

93
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,350
I think that you suit being the Prince better than anyone else.

94
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:53,180
I was very impressed when you were smiling to the people at the parade till the end.

95
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,960
I was thinking that you have to be like that to be a Prince.

96
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,970
Anyone can do that.

97
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,810
And also, after two or three years, we'll be close friends.

98
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,890
And even if we become non-related people,
when you're still the Prince..

99
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,230
I can see you through the TV.

100
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,500
Are you the heartless type of person?

101
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,520
After you break up with me, you stop all contacts and only acknowledge me from the TV?

102
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,920
But guess what? I can't let you do that.

103
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
Then what about you? Are you planning on living your life without any contact?

104
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,560
What?!

105
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,360
By then, I'll have a bad reputation of being the divorced Prince and the people will leave me,

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
so you should at least be there for me.

107
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
It's boring!

108
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,600
If I quit being the Prince, then I'll have nothing to do.

109
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,210
Why isn't it going?

110
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,130
This is not good.

111
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,270
I think we have to call someone.

112
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,080
No! Let's try to fix it ourselves.

113
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,470
Be careful, HalmaMama.

114
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,700
What's the use of us sneaking out quietly when you didn't even make any precautions?

115
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
How could you make this mistake?
You are making me so mad!

116
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,020
Humans tend to make mistakes.

117
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,480
Are you still considered to be human when you committed this mistake? Oh my, I am speechless.

118
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,260
HalmaMama is here. Why are you blabbering...

119
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
HalmaMama, isn't it true? Right? He made a mistake right? Yah! You made a mistake!

120
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,450
Do you think the guy noticed us?

121
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,230
I don't think he knows.

122
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,900
What do you mean by he doesn't know?
Of course he does!

123
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,180
There's going to be a big dilemma if he knows.

124
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,910
Huh?

125
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,360
No, I don't think he knows.

126
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes, that's true cause we dressed up like this.

127
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,770
Since she looks weird, he might not have noticed.

128
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,690
Whatever! Just look at your face!

129
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,360
Forget it!

130
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,060
Your face!

131
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,710
Oh my! What happened?

132
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,210
Oh my goodness! How could this happen?

133
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,660
How did this happen?

134
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,580
Mama... Tae-hu Mama... are you all right?

135
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,050
Are you hurt?

136
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,450
Don't worry since I was the one who convinced them to go.

137
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,830
And also, let me put this out to you first.

138
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:31,020
You must not let this incident spread out and let it be a hot topic for the busybodies.

139
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,240
Yes, Mama.

140
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,540
Yes, Mama.

141
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,420
I'm leaving first.

142
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,710
Okay, bye!

143
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,760
My goodness!

144
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,810
My god, she's so stuck up.

145
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,230
Her face has a lot of fat, too.

146
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,990
Ya, usually she pretends to be so honest. I didn't think that she had such high skilled techniques.

147
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,580
A completely hateful person.

148
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,730
I know!

149
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,920
Truthfully, can she even do ballet?

150
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,580
Or the teacher just overestimated her.

151
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,060
True!

152
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,360
It's all done by money.

153
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,010
What do you mean?

154
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,740
Ya, you know last time when
she was at the Thailand competition?

155
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,020
I heard that she spent money to go by the back door.

156
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,280
That's making me totally speechless.

157
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,770
Ya, and how dare she seek a relationship with the higher social standing Prince?

158
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,670
Exactly what I said.

159
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,630
The next one is this...

160
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,890
How are we going to handle this kind of matter?

161
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,190
First, check through the table of contents.

162
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,080
Then, you can amend any part that seems unfit.

163
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,530
Bingung Mama.

164
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,900
Jeonha is now doing the public duties in place of the King.

165
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,810
I have something to ask Shin Goon.

166
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,820
But it's not that urgent.

167
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,130
Then, I'll be leaving first.

168
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,520
Wait..

169
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,630
Can you please leave first?

170
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,200
Yes, Jeonha.

171
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,250
What's this?

172
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,110
It must really good for cracking the walnuts.

173
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,480
What are you doing, again?

174
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,320
You, at that time...

175
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,770
When we were at Jeju Island...

176
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,510
Why did you throw such a big temper?

177
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,110
Is it because you were sorry towards me?

178
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,070
You'll never admit your mistakes, right?

179
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,850
Because you don't know what to do.

180
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,740
That's why you got angry?

181
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,480
If you came here just to say this type of nonsense...

182
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,000
Then, don't bother me and just leave.

183
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,530
About Hyorin's letter...

184
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,460
You still haven't given me an answer yet.

185
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,070
Don't be sad...

186
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,900
because of those letters.

187
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,980
If there was no me...

188
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,530
Will it really be boring?

189
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,470
It'll be feel empty.

190
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,710
Mom.

191
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,000
Did you call for me?

192
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,050
Yes.

193
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,160
You are the prince that's second in line to succeed.

194
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,180
When the crown prince empties out that position...

195
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,220
You are the person who has the duty
to replace him for that emptied position.

196
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,820
So why did you go out of the palace without being approved?

197
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,480
What are you thinking about?

198
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:42,480
Do you know the reason why I gave up wearing the beautiful modern clothes to wear this sort of thing?

199
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,200
The tiger before it hunts...

200
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,360
It has to crawl and crawl again.

201
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,200
We are now in the same situation as well.

202
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,220
You are the person to become King in the future.

203
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,020
Don't ever do those reckless actions again!

204
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,650
Understand?

205
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,980
Yes.

206
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,060
I understand.

207
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,610
It must be an inconvience for
the Tae-Hu to have no place to stay.

208
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,530
But I couldn't stop her as she insisted on
staying in that broken down pavillion.

209
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,880
That's really Hye Jung Gong's style.

210
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,930
Mama, please pardon me.

211
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,070
After the Chu Jeon ended...

212
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,160
Tae-Hu Mama has already become TaeHwangTae-Hu Mama.

213
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,750
Hye Jung Gong mama is now Hye Jung Jong Mama.

214
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,250
I have forgotten again.

215
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,550
I shouldn't call her Hye Jung Gong but Hye Jung Jong.

216
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,860
Hwang-hu, you must have a lot of unhappiness
towards this time's Chu Jeon.

217
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,420
Mama... no...

218
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,060
I know all about it.

219
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,530
I know everything.

220
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,710
The Chu Jeon this time,
isn't for Hye Jung Jong or Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

221
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:15,120
It's the only present that a living mother
can give to her son who has left first.

222
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,500
Hwang-Hu, please try to understand about
this with an open mind.

223
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,440
Please pardon me, Mama.

224
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:31,110
For 14 years, Tae-hu has been living in loneliness in England.

225
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,210
Even if you feel some inconvenience, please try to accommodate with an open heart and show her love.

226
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,480
Yes, TaeHwangTaeHu Mama.

227
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,380
What?! Why are you so mean to leave me alone!?

228
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,700
Take me along as well.

229
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,600
Shin ChaeJoon.

230
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,430
Is mom going to the Palace for fun?

231
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,600
Yes, for fun.

232
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,720
Fun? You rascal.

233
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,210
Isn't the King, your mom's client?

234
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,030
Her client had fainted,
of course she has to do the management service.

235
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,710
Then about you, Dad?

236
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,890
Dad, why must you tag along as well?

237
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,830
Me? I...

238
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,930
That's what I said.

239
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,340
I don't know why you are tagging along
as well since you are so bothersome.

240
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,060
What are you talking about now?

241
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm going to do some management work as well, of course.

242
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,350
What management?

243
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,560
A...S...

244
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,640
According to the meaning of the word, since we married our daughter over there...

245
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,170
Of course, we will have to do the following up management.

246
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,810
According to the act of administration of
the serious disease safeguard..

247
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,160
It'll only be effective 90 days after the day the insurance was bought.

248
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,530
It was really coincidental that happened earlier by one day.

249
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,240
It's alright.

250
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,580
What's alright about it?

251
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,050
This is really an unfortunate matter.

252
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,930
That's really an unfortunate matter to miss by just one day.

253
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,960
Speaking of which...

254
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,390
You must be very worried because of the King,
Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

255
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,340
Thank you for your concern.

256
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,150
We should have come to visit you much earlier.

257
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,270
But we only come now...

258
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,620
I was only focusing on persuading my customers to buy insurance.

259
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,550
I'm really sorry if my after-services is still not good enough.

260
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,120
And so, I have prepared some complimentary gifts.

261
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,480
It's alright, you don't need to be like this.

262
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,180
What's alright about it?

263
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,920
They might look like nothing to you.

264
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,910
But all of these are really useful things.

265
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,070
This is...

266
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,880
What's that?

267
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,740
This is the automatic spectacles cleaning machine.

268
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,810
Just place the dirty spectacles in here.

269
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,830
After you pour in some cleaning solution.

270
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,430
Close it.

271
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,650
If it starts to move...

272
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,880
The spectacles will be washed clean.

273
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,780
And this is a book reading aid device.

274
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,870
Like this. If you place it on top of the book...

275
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,280
You can start reading like that...

276
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,960
And this...

277
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,890
What can this be?

278
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,110
Military ultraviolet lamp.

279
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,800
There's no need for batteries.

280
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,070
There's no environmental damage nor pollution.

281
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,290
This type of ultraviolet lamp.

282
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,870
It's not bad either to use it for exercise.

283
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,300
Here, Mama.

284
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,900
I will satisfy any needs or conditions.

285
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,870
Total service.

286
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,280
Once you buy insurance from me,
I'll be reponsible till the end.

287
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,230
Excuse me.

288
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,010
If you are unable to get me when a customer needs me.

289
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,780
That's a big no.

290
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,750
To increase the peace and joy in your family.

291
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,840
I'm Lee Sun-Ae.

292
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,010
How may I help you, sir?

293
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,750
Please wait a moment...

294
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,260
There's another call...

295
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,740
To increase the peace and joy in your family.

296
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,070
I'm Lee Sun-Ae.

297
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,770
Sir, how may I help you?

298
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,100
What about Fu Wan Goon?

299
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,210
Have you found work yet?

300
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,270
Not yet.

301
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,740
I'm really satisfied with my job as a house-husband.

302
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,210
These household chores...

303
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,730
They will be really hard if you don't have perseverance.

304
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,210
Yes.

305
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,680
Doing housework is just like this.

306
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,500
Cleaning.. Washing.. scrubbing..

307
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,680
Anyway, although there's no end to it once I start.

308
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,000
I tell myself that I must do it and
do it seriously based on that mentality.

309
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,970
I feel really fulfilled everyday.

310
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,360
Seeing that the Fu Wan Goon couple is really loving.

311
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,740
It really makes me feel a lot at ease.

312
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,110
Isn't that so, Hwang-hu?

313
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,520
Yes, Mama.

314
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,060
Then... our Chaegyung... Bingung Mama...

315
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,350
Park Sang Gong.

316
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,640
Yes, Mama.

317
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,380
Where's the Crown Princess right now?

318
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:42,970
Yes, Bingung Mama is now at the Western Halls studying under the guidance of Choi Sang Gong, Mama.

319
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,140
Let her stop studying for a while and
come over since her parents are here.

320
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,010
There's no need to, Mama.

321
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,970
Let us go back first since
she's in the middle of her studies.

322
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,640
Because I'm a million US dollars club member.

323
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,800
There are still lots of other customers that I have to manage.

324
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,250
But since we are here... I really miss her...

325
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,990
Get up now...

326
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,880
Anyway, I'll be responsible to the end for our ChaeGyung, Bingung Mama's after services.

327
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,260
If you find anything not bad while using it.

328
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,960
Just give me a call and I'll bring more over.

329
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,160
Thank you.

330
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,610
Goodbye.

331
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,690
How many times must I repeat myself before you listen?

332
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,490
Didn't I tell you before that now's
the Bingung Mama's study time?

333
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,140
Then, Choi Sang Gong...

334
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,570
Didn't you listen to what I said?

335
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,400
Tae-Hu Mama is requesting for her to go over right now.

336
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,280
Kwak Sang Gong.

337
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,630
The person waiting on Hwang Tae-Hu Mama...

338
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,320
How can you be conveying the orders from Tae-Hu?

339
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,940
It seems like you are not aware of
the changes in the palace.

340
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,140
For this time's personel transfer...

341
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,670
I received orders from Hwang Tae-Hu mama
to serve under Tae-Hu.

342
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,890
Back down now.

343
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,060
This is the time being set down by Hwang-hu Mama.

344
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm now conveying the orders from Tae-Hu mama who's rank is higher than the Queen.

345
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,440
What? What did you say just now?

346
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,270
When did the words you speak out started to become so short?

347
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,650
Tae-Hu Mama instructed me...

348
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,690
That I won't need to use the ancient way of speaking if I'm not talking to the people from the upper palace.

349
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,770
And I don't need to call myself, So-In either...

350
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,770
Traditions cannot be changed within a day or two.

351
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,710
As a Sang Gong who had served
the Hwang Tae-hu Mama before...

352
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,730
Why are you so ignorant even about this?

353
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,300
What?

354
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,580
Is it Choi Sang Gong?

355
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,250
Yes, Mama.

356
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,450
Come with me.

357
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,900
Bingung.

358
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,270
Why do you still need to study when
you have entered the palace for so long?

359
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,120
Tae-hu Mama.

360
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,740
Bingung mama...

361
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,380
I'm not asking Choi Sang Gong.

362
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,770
Bingung.

363
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,840
Bingung, what have you learnt during this period of time?

364
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,090
Well... about that...

365
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,170
The book of Filial piety, Confucian analects as well.

366
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,390
And...

367
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,150
Why can't you even answer
the things that you have learned before?

368
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm sorry, Tae-Hu Mama.

369
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,970
Bingung Mama has learnt the book of Filial piety..

370
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,870
Four books and five classic, Confucian analects,
Book of poems and so on.

371
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,180
Is that so?

372
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,250
In that case...

373
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,380
Please explain the meaning of the phrase.

374
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,790
This day.. Filial to husband.. Virture is the basic..
Learned from teachings..

375
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Eh?

376
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,110
Well...

377
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,750
Bingung.

378
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,800
How can you not know such a simple phrase?

379
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,650
I remember it now Mama.

380
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,010
Being filial is the basics of education.
Education should start with filial piety.

381
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,280
Well said, Mama.

382
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,600
Yes. That's right.

383
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,150
As Tae-Hu, I am checking if Bingung slacks in her education.

384
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,730
The crown princess' palace maids, bring in all the books which she had learnt these while.

385
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,170
All of them?

386
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,360
What are you all standing for?

387
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,450
Didn't you heard what Tae-Hu Mama just said?

388
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,660
Yes Mama. We understand you.

389
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,970
It's so heavy. There are so many.
Can Bingung Mama recite them all?

390
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,510
I don't know. Don't talk to me.

391
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,630
Walk towards that side.

392
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,190
Very sorry, Dae Goon Mama.

393
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,270
Really sorry. Because we can't see where we are going.

394
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,340
Let me help you.

395
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,130
There is no need. We can do it.

396
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,790
So many books, where are you bringing them to?

397
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,660
Now, Tae-Hu Mama is with Bingung Mama,
and she is throwing her temper.

398
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,760
Yah!

399
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,530
How is Bingung's public welfare activities?

400
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,780
I am still a student.

401
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,720
There are still a lot more things that I need to learn.

402
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,720
Bingung!

403
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,640
You have already entered the palace for a long time.
Why do you still need to learn?

404
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,550
It's because I am still a student.

405
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,970
You won't be a student forever.

406
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,790
Please do your part as a crown princess.

407
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,420
What is the use of sitting at a corner of a room
and just blindly memorizing?

408
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,090
You should set your priorities right!

409
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,840
Dae Goon Mama!

410
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,550
All of you, please leave.

411
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,420
Tae-Hu Mama.

412
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,830
Lecturing the crown princess in front of the palace maids may not be against the palace's rules,

413
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,530
but I believe it's not something an elder should do.

414
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,320
You!

415
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Yul Goon.

416
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,950
To observe the Royal family's crisis foreword aspect.
Which exactly should be the first priority?

417
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,080
That needs more observation.

418
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,150
Let's go, Chaegyung.

419
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,970
Yah!

420
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,890
Don't take it too hard.

421
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,660
It's okay.

422
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,580
Actually, what Tae-Hu Mama said is true.

423
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,160
But what is this? It doesn't look like a guitar.

424
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,350
That's mandolin.

425
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,440
Mandolin?

426
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,240
It sounds sad.

427
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,290
Where is the Arts Department office?

428
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,870
The Arts Department office is that
the 2nd level of the main building.

429
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,170
Reflect.

430
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,460
I like shin.

431
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,340
I fell for him.

432
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,740
It hurts...

433
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,820
Rub it for me.

434
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,930
Mom... mom...

435
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,610
As long as you can smile,
I will always be here for you.

436
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,330
Don't forget.

437
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,370
What?

438
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,460
Hye Jung Gong?

439
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,630
Yes. Mama.

440
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,280
Choi Sang Gong. Tell me the details.

441
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,520
Yes, Mama.

442
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:42,490
Tae-Hu Mama took the fact that Bingung Mama didn't attend public functions, and gave her a trashing down.

443
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,210
Right.

444
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,110
She even wants to interfere with Bingung's matters now.

445
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
So you finally reveal what you are thinking.

446
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:01,110
Choi Sang Gong. Now tell me extactly what did Hye Jung Gong say to Bingung.

447
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,600
I will do as you ordered, Mama.

448
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,410
No.

449
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,360
I should see Hye Jung Gong right now.

450
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,940
It is better that I handle all of Bingung's problems.

451
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,540
The problems of the daughter-in-law should be handled by the Mother-in-law. Are you trying to say this?

452
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,620
Bingung is not only your daughter-in-law.

453
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,340
I, too, treat her as my daughter-in-law.

454
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,780
Is it wrong for me to think that way?

455
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,150
The Queen thinks that I am making use of the power I have as Queen Dowager.

456
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,220
Are you thinking that way?

457
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,640
What do you mean?

458
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,710
14 years ago...

459
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,230
I never used any form of power against the Queen when I was the Crown Princess.

460
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,800
The late King doted on me, that was the truth right?

461
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,180
And when you suddenly became
the crown princess and entered the palace.

462
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:15,850
I remembered putting in a lot of
good words for you in front of the late King.

463
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,900
Even though you had faults...

464
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,050
The person who believed that you could succeed was also me.

465
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,730
But when the time came,

466
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,600
I had to leave the palace according to palace rules,

467
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,100
What did the Queen do then?

468
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,770
There was nothing I could do.

469
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,990
Well, the turning of life carries on.

470
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,920
The life of the queen and mine are always intertwining together.

471
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,780
It may seems that there are a lot of changes,

472
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,280
But there are more things that don't change.

473
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,180
need not look for it for long

474
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:23,980
the road over the mountain

475
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,800
you look the same from the past

476
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,720
it's like you are standing there

477
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:39,130
The story that is older than my memories

478
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,550
The look on my face when I saw you

479
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:55,540
Even though I tried my best to avoid you

480
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:04,780
Maybe one day just like you

481
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:14,660
Right now, I want to go towards you

482
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,940
Living should be like this

483
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,950
Words are said like that

484
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,520
Is everyone wrong?

485
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,840
So everyone knows. Shut-up!

486
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,570
Can a song be forgotten like this?

487
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,850
Can you love and be loved?

488
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,920
Can money mean success?

489
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,980
Having a car can make you run faster. Shut-up!

490
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,500
When you shut-up listen to me

491
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,300
We must race

492
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,330
We can't become fools

493
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,180
Horse. Race!

494
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,890
Horse. Race!

495
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,800
Horse. Race!

496
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,430
Horse. Race!!!

497
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,950
Yes, thank you so much, Mr. Park

498
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,950
Anyways, thanks for your interesting report.

499
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,680
I didn't do anything.

500
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,180
It's because of all your hard labor.

501
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,480
There is much more to thank you for in the future.

502
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,560
Yes.

503
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,010
The rumors are all about discords between the crown prince and the crown princess?

504
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,650
I am afraid so, Mama.

505
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,100
Follow me to the Tae Won Palace.

506
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,570
I heard about these rumors as well.

507
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,300
But I never thought it was so serious.

508
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,740
What should be done?

509
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,380
New rumors will arise from these rumors.

510
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,890
Is there no way to counter this?

511
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,300
From what I see...

512
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,870
To stop these rumors about the falling out of the royal couple,

513
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,820
The best way is to let the crown prince and
the crown princess share a room.

514
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:26,210
Great Queen already hinted this idea sometime ago.

515
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,210
The sharing of room...

516
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,230
Shin Goon.

517
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,850
What's with him??

518
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,660
When he is in a good mood
he will say "myorn nam pyong" come over.

519
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,250
When he is in a bad mood, he gives a sulky face.

520
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,580
Totally a split personality.

521
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,170
Oh, you are up?

522
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,430
Come in.

523
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,600
It's really boring to do nothing everyday.

524
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,510
You don't even have the newspaper?

525
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,600
Father.

526
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,800
I got it.

527
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,800
You are a filial daughter to your mother.

528
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,800
I almost forgot.

529
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,400
Compared to the newspaper,
a book is much better right?

530
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,210
The publications department already did precautions.

531
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,250
The palace is free from such.

532
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:13,750
But the rapid spreading of these on
the Internet cannot seem to be stopped.

533
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,140
So, we can do nothing and just watch it spread hopelessly?

534
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,930
After the Thailand photos incident,
reports like these are endless.

535
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,190
I am afraid so Mama.

536
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,690
Then we can refute it directly.

537
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,210
How about a clarification reporters meeting?

538
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,970
If the handling of such rumors is incorrect,

539
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,980
The citizens may have a deeper
misunderstanding of the matter, Mama.

540
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,340
Is it?

541
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,420
Of course we can't let that happen.

542
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,170
Perhaps words are not good to say but how about allowing the publication department to handle it.

543
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,350
Even though things like the Internet get a lot of attention, they are not as believable as well.

544
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,810
As time goes by, the rumors will eventually fade away, Mama

545
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,550
Is it?

546
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,560
Wouldn't that be great?

547
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,360
The most important thing is...

548
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,590
After this particular incident,
I had some thoughts, Mama.

549
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,670
Please say them.

550
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,180
Using this chance...

551
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,510
How about a great grandchild Mama?

552
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,420
Are you saying a royal grandchild?

553
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,710
Yes Mama.

554
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,210
But the crown prince and crown princess are still young.

555
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,630
The age for the royal family is always
earlier upon comparison to the public.

556
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,590
Also, the king's health is failing...

557
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,760
From my observation at Jejudo,

558
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,740
The crown prince and crown princess
seems to be very good friends,

559
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,370
but they don't look like a couple.

560
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,910
That's really unspeakable.

561
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,290
Let's get into trouble for once, Queen.

562
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,080
Mama, trouble?

563
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,670
It's the sharing of the room.

564
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,770
The truth is that I am also yearning for a royal grandchild.

565
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,880
What do you all think?

566
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,300
Let's do it this way Mama.

567
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,600
But... Mama.

568
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,690
Didn't you get pregnant with HyaeMyung
after the sharing of the room?

569
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,480
Compared to the King and Queen, our crown prince and crown princess are lagging way too behind.

570
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,640
Therefore, you should pass on the baton, Hwang-hu.

571
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,720
Yes, Mama.

572
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,500
Then we agreed upon letting them share a room.

573
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,890
Prepare it quickly.

574
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,840
Yes, Mama.

575
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,610
What is this?

576
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,820
Hwang Tae-Hu Mama specially asked the medical center to prepare this for you, Jeonha.

577
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,590
How can I drink it without knowing what it is?

578
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,840
Jeonha...

579
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:18,770
It is good for your body,
please do not question and drink it.

580
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,000
You are strange today.

581
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,400
Mama, we will do the treatment for you.

582
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,970
Unni, why are you all like this all of a sudden?

583
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,170
There is a reason for it Bingung Mama.

584
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,090
What is it exactly?

585
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,190
This happens only once in a lifetime,
we are sorry but we can't tell you.

586
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,630
This is really frustrating.

587
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,350
Mama, you will be spending the night outside tonight.

588
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,350
What? Isn't it against the rules to spend
the night away from here?

589
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,690
Other than that, we are not sure.

590
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,710
Oh, so frustrating.

591
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,610
Have you seen the rumors about
the discord on the internet?

592
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,390
A lot of people must be very anxious and worried.

593
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,970
The rumors weren't as easy to disperse as they thought right?

594
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,280
You think I will quietly watch it fade away?

595
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,430
There is no way.

596
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,090
Anyways, seeing them getting busy
with the sharing of the room,

597
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,140
I think they are all pretty worried and anxious.

598
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,610
What sharing of the room?

599
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,180
Yes. I heard the sharing of the room is tonight.

600
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,590
Tonight?

601
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:59,410
Yes, it seems that they are trying to produce a royal grandchild to shut the mouths of the public.

602
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:04,020
But they will know in the near future,
that they are running out of time.

603
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,920
Unni, is some special guest going
to arrive for visitation today?

604
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,810
The whole dress code is also...

605
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,630
I guess you can count it as a special guest.

606
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,740
Mama, please wait patiently.

607
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,970
But... this atmosphere looks very familiar.

608
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,000
Don't tell me it's!

609
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,750
Why do I have to wear a suit in the middle of the night?

610
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,070
Is anyone here for a visitation?

611
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,200
What is this? Why are you here?

612
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,270
Why are you dressed like that?

613
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,620
It can't be opened?

614
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,790
We are locked in here?

615
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:50,180
The once in a lifetime wedding night is being forced upon

616
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,810
This is too much.

617
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,390
The floor is cold.

618
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,290
What?

619
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,340
Whose idea is this?

620
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,830
This is so childish.

621
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,900
They gave an electric heater mat though.

622
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,310
What? It's a single.

623
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,240
What is going on exactly?

624
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,070
They really crack their brains for this.

625
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,720
They are using all kind of ideas to
make us stay close to each other.

626
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,980
It seems that we have to stay close
to each other while sleeping on the mat.

627
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,990
That really feels like the wedding night.

628
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,840
I need to go to the restroom.

629
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,560
Sister, I need to go to the restroom!

630
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,720
Really! Open the door.
I really need to go! Sister!!

631
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,260
Shin is a fussy person,
he won't lay a hand on someone he doesn't like.

632
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,980
No.. I am still worried.

633
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:12,610
What is it?

634
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,390
Please go in, Dae Goon Mama.

635
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,140
Move aside.

636
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,350
Are you going to block my way?

637
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,580
It's the orders from Tae-Hu Mama.
Dae Goon Mama is not to go anywhere today.

638
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,350
My mother?

639
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,130
I am going out, move aside.

640
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,990
We are sorry, Dae Goon Mama.

641
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,130
Move aside.

642
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,130
Very sorry.

643
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,590
You can't participate in the matter today.

644
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,530
Even though I don't agree with the sharing of the room...

645
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,970
But if you have anything to do with these matters of the royalty, people will talk about it.

646
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,340
Don't even think about going out tonight.

647
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,320
Mom.

648
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,900
Mom!

649
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,880
Mom!!

650
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,220
What about?

651
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,470
This is not the first time we share a bed.

652
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,460
Lay down before you freeze to death.

653
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,620
But...

654
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,970
Are you going to sleep on the cold floor alone?

655
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,460
I heard that the temperature is
going to drop to a new low tonight.

656
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,420
Why? Are you afraid?

657
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,060
Afraid that I might pounce on you?

658
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,030
It's not that.

659
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,680
What? Am I a beast?

660
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,560
You looking like that, it's not a bit appealing.

661
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,300
The wedding night should be spending
with the one you love right?

662
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,220
What?

663
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,430
So?

664
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,080
We are not.

665
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,390
Do whatever you wish.

666
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,090
I don't care if you freeze to death.

667
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,680
You're still not getting in?

668
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,610
Isn't it cold sitting there?

669
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,300
It's okay.

670
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,800
Okay? What okay?

671
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,120
Yah! Your hand is freezing already and it's still okay?

672
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,650
Stop it and get in here quick.

673
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,850
I don't want to sleep beside a wife who freeze to death.

674
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,720
The truth is..

675
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,060
What is it again?

676
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:58,170
I don't know how to remove the headset.

677
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,530
How do I sleep wearing this?

678
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,530
It's so heavy.

679
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,820
Come here quickly.

680
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,050
Cannot.

681
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,940
Come here quickly.

682
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,040
I told you cannot.

683
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,300
Stay still and stop moving around.

684
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,130
I waited a long time for this.

685
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,490
Come here.

686
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,850
Yah! We can't be like this!

687
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:13,240
Yah!

688
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,580
I can't stand it anymore.

689
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,630
Cannot. Cannot.

690
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:20,600
I am also hot-blooded teenager.

691
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,160
Cannot. Cannot...

692
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,480
Cannot. Cannot...

693
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,550
Can... can... can... can...

694
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,030
Yah. What are you doing with your eyes close?

695
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,120
Oh. I am running out of patience waiting.

696
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,260
Is it going to take long?

697
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,200
Don't move.

698
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,130
Ah~~ pain... pain... pain...

699
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,620
Yah! Be gentle.

700
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,150
It's not like that?

701
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,950
Oh I know!

702
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,680
Don't move. One, Two.

703
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,670
From the looks of it...

704
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,380
Don't you think that it resembles the wedding night in the historical TV dramas?

705
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,070
You look uncomfortable,
why don't I loosen the clothes for you as well?

706
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:04,980
What?

707
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,930
In TV drama, this is the order of things...

708
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,920
Remove the headset, loosen the clothes,
remove the clothes, off the lights

709
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,660
Shut up!

710
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,670
Undress and come in.

711
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:20,950
Undress?

712
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,810
No way.

713
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,770
Yah! I don't want the noisy fabric touching me.

714
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,890
Turn.. turn.. turn.. turn..

715
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,180
What are you doing turning there?

716
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,510
Quickly undress it!

717
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,320
No.

718
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,620
You are really not going to undress that. Is that it?

719
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,310
Why do I need to undress?

720
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:50,940
Quickly undress!

721
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,520
Why do I need to undress?
No. Don't be like this!

722
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,390
The crown prince is really enthusiastic about this.

723
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,090
Just now, the crown prince even drank the tonic.

724
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,020
He is a hot-blooded teenager and adding the tonic to it...

725
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,760
There is a lot to watch out for tonight.

726
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,540
Really fussy.

727
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,090
Dirty.

728
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,150
Dirty.

729
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,850
Dirty.

730
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,580
It's very dirty!

731
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,410
Can I ask you something?

732
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,420
What is it again?

733
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,070
The same question I asked in the day...

734
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,760
Why do you like Hyorin?

735
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,360
It's my privacy.

736
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,810
Then I am curious.

737
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,450
Hyorin...

738
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,450
She's a lot like me...

739
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,500
Lonely and restricted.

740
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:19,500
Because I am not like you, so you dislike me.

741
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,670
What's wrong with you?

742
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,260
None of your business!

743
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,820
Since it's already like this,
why don't we do what the adults want us to do?

744
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,260
It's all planned already right? Is it not?

745
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,550
Stop playing around.

746
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,210
What if I'm for real?

747
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,090
After we breakup...

748
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,460
When you find someone you really love...

749
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,050
You can do it all you want at that time.

750
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,490
You don't seem to understand the situation.

751
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,870
Men and women are different.

752
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,810
We can do it with the woman we don't like as well.

753
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,790
Do you want to continue like this?

754
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,130
Do you want to die in my hands?

755
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:48,280
It's all thanks to you that we got to this stage.
You didn't do your part.

756
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,970
If you pretended to live harmoniously with me,
then we won't have to end up like this.

757
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,100
It's all your fault that we ended up like this.

758
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,170
How is it my fault?

759
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,690
Being together with a jerk like you,
how do I live harmoniously?

760
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,220
Abusing me everyday, torturing me everyday...

761
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,030
How do I live more harmoniously with you?

762
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,110
Royal jerk!

763
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,330
You!

764
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,840
Yah!

765
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,600
Aerobics in the middle of the night?

766
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,710
Can't you see? I am exercising.

767
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,940
It's better to do this than to quarrel with you.

768
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,450
Perhaps moving around a bit
can help me sleep better later.

769
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,440
Can sleep better by doing this?

770
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,440
Let's do it together.

771
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,150
How? One two three four...

772
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,230
Cycling 5 rounds...

773
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,460
What's wrong with you?

774
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,680
It hurts. Be gentle.

775
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,840
This can't be done like that,
even if it hurts, you have to endure it.

776
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,550
But it hurts a lot.

777
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,000
Just endure for a while.

778
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,630
How do I endure when it is so painful?

779
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,210
I told you to be gentle.

780
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,230
I told you to be gentle.

781
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,450
With your strength, you can go wrestling already.

782
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,450
Why are you acting so coy for.

783
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,140
There is still one more left.

784
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,390
Be gentle.

785
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:42,300
Gentle.

786
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,520
Pain.

787
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:47,770
I told you to be gentle.

788
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,770
Let's do it one more time.

789
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,510
It's coming.

790
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,280
You broke the rules.

791
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,890
I am sorry. I didn't use a lot of strength.

792
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,940
The eyes?

793
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,230
The eyes got hit?

794
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Let me take a look.

795
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,940
Here? Here? Does it hurt?

796
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,820
What are you doing!!!

797
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,010
Are you okay?

798
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,140
That's why.

799
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,070
Why did you do the things you don't normally do.

800
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,560
You made me angry.

801
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,510
Even if you are thinking of nonsense, this is too much.

802
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,800
What?

803
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,440
I am curious about your reaction.

804
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,920
With that look of yours,
you think it's worth it for anyone to pounce on you?

805
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:12,760
Yes. I don't think you are the kind of beast that will lay a hand on a girl you don't like.

806
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:19,310
But you scared me.

807
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,870
You try that again and I'll use this to...

808
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,370
I don't hate you.

809
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:34,680
Why do you think that way?

810
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,840
It's not that I dislike you.

811
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,270
I am just trying to be careful.

812
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:46,570
I just hope...

813
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,900
Even if we break up and meet on the streets...

814
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,140
We can smile at each other and
have a cool relationship like that.

815
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,500
If so, we should start preparing now, to be careful.

816
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,250
Is it not?

817
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:09,380
If you are careful, you can do it?

818
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,210
It'll be very difficult for me.

819
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:17,350
Whenever I think about having to meet you on the streets,

820
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,620
My heart will feel very sad.

821
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,650
Let's go to sleep.

822
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,940
We are locked in anyway.
