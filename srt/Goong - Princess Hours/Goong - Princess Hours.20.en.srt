00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,460
Episode 20

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,330
Bingung Mama, wait...

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,930
Diet...

4
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,080
What is this?

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,920
Don't you know how to read it yourself?

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,140
It says, "The Crown Princess secretly meeting a man."

7
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,130
"The truth behind Crown Princess's affair?
Who is her man?"

8
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,530
How did this happen?

9
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,230
The person who stole your car is telling the world
that you were with another man.

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,890
Who were you with?

11
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,710
I was with Yul Goon.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,640
Are you insanely mad!?!!

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,480
A married woman with the cousin-in-law...

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,070
And furthermore in the middle of the night, that
the river bank, how will people see this!?!

15
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,770
This will get big.
You better get yourself prepared.

16
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,510
Bingung Mama.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
The Great Queen calls for you.

18
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,700
You stay here. I will handle it.

19
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,190
No. It's better that I go.

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,630
It started because of me.

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,320
So I should be responsible for it.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,950
Don't tell me...

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,080
You're going to tell the truth?

24
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,260
If not, then what should I say?

25
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,500
Don't say you were with Yul.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,850
Or else, both of you will get into trouble.

27
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,040
Who is that man you were with?

28
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,400
Why are you not speaking?

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,930
Bingung.

30
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,770
Please speak up.

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,490
Aren't we a family?

32
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,240
That...

33
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,290
I was together with my father.

34
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,470
With your father?

35
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,480
In the middle of the night...

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,230
What was it so urgent that you had to meet up with your father?

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,590
That's because...

38
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,850
Father was worried about managing of the resting area in the palace.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
People say he used the backdoor...

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,900
So I feel that I should tell him about it.

41
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,360
And so we met up.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,350
So there is things like this.

43
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:28,380
Yes. I also felt that our Bingung would not do that kind of thing.

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,680
See. I know it was like this.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,240
The Crown Princess's scandal.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,720
It hasn’t lasted for a day, and now how can you come up with matters like this?

47
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,050
When food moves hand to hand it gets smaller,

48
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,050
and when story move hand to hand it gets bigger.

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,110
You eat less but you talk more.

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,990
Mother, let's act depending on the situations.

51
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,760
The truth will be out sooner or later.

52
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,440
Bingung, from tomorrow onwards...

53
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,540
Reflect on yourself.

54
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,070
Yes. Hwang-Hu Mama.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,940
Why do you husband and wife, not letting us to have a peace of mind?

56
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,510
The Crown Prince's problem has only been settled for a while...

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,020
And now, this ordeal with Bingung...

58
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,990
Are you going to smear
the reputation of the royal family?

59
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,820
It's all because of my carelessness.

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,030
Yes.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,990
How does the Crown Prince feel about Bingung's words, being together with her dad?

62
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,440
Even though Bingung is still young...

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,460
But she has an honest personality.

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,550
She won't lie about this.

65
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,090
I think so too but...

66
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,920
I am worried about
the guy who she was with.

67
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,980
Perhaps...

68
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,400
Is it because there might be problems between the Crown Prince and Bingung?

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,070
Even though it's a marriage arranged by the elders...

70
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,020
We kept the trusts and promises between us like husband and wife.

71
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,010
This incident perhaps will allow those people another excuse to remove the royal family.

72
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,100
The Crown Prince and Bingung have to be careful and even more careful.

73
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,370
I will remember it by heart.

74
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,340
Now are you crazy?!?

75
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,460
If others know that it is you,
what are you going to do?

76
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,460
I have the responsibility too.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,090
I can't allow Chaegyung to handle this alone.

78
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,230
So?

79
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,370
The royal family and public pressure,
can they help her?

80
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,790
How are you going to handle this?

81
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,470
You are someone who is going to become the King.

82
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,410
Having a scandal with your cousin in law, who is going to protect you?

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
Mom.

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,690
Comparing to being king, I treasure Chaegyung more.

85
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,440
If I have to give up one of the two,

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,160
I will give up the position of the king.

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,240
Of course, the conditions has gaining one over another.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,540
What are you saying now?

89
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,340
What is the reason that we took the steps we took?

90
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,390
Father's incomplete dreams for the royal family, I want to fulfill them too.

91
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,340
But now...

92
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,910
I want something more.

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,140
As long as I have Chaegyung...

94
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,390
It doesn’t matter if I become a commoner.

95
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,970
You say things like that....

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,120
Mom.

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,380
Mom! Mom! Mom!

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,060
Oh my goodness.

99
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,640
How can there be such a ridiculous report?

100
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,060
Right? Honey?

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,690
It seems that our Chaegyung
has something bothering her.

102
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,060
What kind?

103
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,560
Don't tell me, you believe such a report?

104
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,290
Of course not!

105
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,110
Is our Chaegyung that kind of person?

106
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,300
No.. I don't mean it...

107
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,860
I am saying, I feel a bit weird.. that...

108
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,970
Perhaps pig really has a boyfriend.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,780
Brother-in-law is really too cold of a person.

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,920
Can't you be quiet?

111
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,370
We might as well sue this publisher!

112
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,950
Something like smearing the reputation...

113
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,190
Who are they saying who has an affair...??

114
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,180
You, be quiet.
My brain is already confused enough.

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,180
It's not dad and it's not brother-in-law either.

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,890
Who exactly is it whom she was with?

117
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,040
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

118
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,700
This time it is the Crown Princess who strayed.
Will the royal family be endangered?

119
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,200
Who is her guy?

120
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,720
Yah! Who is it?

121
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,410
Why is the Crown Princess like this?

122
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,140
Chaegyung.

123
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,480
Are you okay?

124
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,430
But, who were you together with?

125
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,080
Can't you tell us secretly?

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,370
Girls!

127
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,330
Still won't shut up?

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,990
I am going to get some fresh air.

129
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,240
Hey, did you see this?

130
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,770
"Scandal of the Crown Princess"

131
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,080
Isn't this all flirtatious?

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,610
How long did they get married only?

133
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,800
My dad said, you cannot hid one's background.

134
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
That's right.

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,010
Crown Princess can do whatever she wants?

136
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,440
Is she fit to be the Crown Princess or not?

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,650
But... who is it?

138
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,720
The guy who was together with her.

139
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,800
Probably he's someone who likes her.

140
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,780
I can't tolerate anymore.

141
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,890
I can't tolerate anymore either.

142
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,100
What did you say?

143
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,340
What did you all say!

144
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,430
What did you all say!?!

145
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,110
In the first place, there are a lot of people jealous of the position of the Crown Princess.

146
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,980
Take it as the bad side of having such a high position.

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,400
If having such a high position is so difficult, what to do?

148
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,570
Yah. Who's the guy?

149
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,150
She likes that guy so much?

150
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,640
Strange.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,580
I feel that both of you were good at the party.

152
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,540
Anyways...

153
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,480
Your wife met another man in
the middle of the night,

154
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,020
your mood must be bad now right?

155
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,170
Can't you be quiet?

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,020
Yah! You all need to be more understanding.

157
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,590
The issues on the internet is not settling down yet,

158
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,360
it has become such a big problem.

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,090
About this incident...

160
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,150
Stating that it was Bingung who made mistakes.

161
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,320
What are we supposed to do?

162
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,040
It is probably because Bingung was a commoner.

163
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,750
So there are a lot of problem makers.

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
In this century,
it doesn't matter the background anymore.

165
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,780
Why are they so critical towards her?

166
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,560
A person's character should be more important.

167
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,180
That's right.

168
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,360
Leaving matters alone is better?

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,590
For this incident...

170
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,200
It is better to report what Bingung said,

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,700
saying that she is together with her father.

172
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,060
The people are curious about who she was with?

173
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,750
This way, this may be more blown up.

174
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,710
Once we removed the curiosity and suspicions...

175
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,340
this way, the attention of the people will then be reduced.

176
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,300
Is this how people are?

177
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,580
If things are really like that it will be good...

178
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,030
What are we hesitating for?

179
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,090
HaeMyung.

180
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,970
Let's do it this way.

181
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes.

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,210
I will discuss with the publicity department.

183
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,570
Are you feeling better?

184
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,340
Are you feeling good now?

185
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,090
You have to, want to see me like this?

186
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,860
Yul.

187
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,600
Take it as you think for mother.

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,090
You will change your heart right?

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,070
I am sorry, Mom.

190
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,420
If the two of them will get divorce...

191
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,610
I will bring Chaegyung and leave this place.

192
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,170
I said it before...

193
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,500
I used to only live for you...

194
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,530
but for the life in the future...

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,930
I want to live for Chaegyung.

196
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,670
Live for myself...

197
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,440
You listen carefully to my words, Yul.

198
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,350
I've never thought of telling you this but..

199
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,450
I gave up everything to get to where I am.

200
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
Mom.

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,230
Hye Jong...

202
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,190
If you don't like the life in the palace...

203
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,870
We leave the palace and leave together ok?

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,140
If you are willing,
I will give up the palace position.

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,890
I used to..

206
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,370
have someone I love too.

207
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,060
If I am together with that person...

208
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,800
It doesn’t matter if I am not royal.

209
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,100
If that person say let's leave...

210
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,930
If doesn’t matter if it's life in a small village.

211
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,440
I will feel that I am happy.

212
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,060
But...

213
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,660
I want to see my son become king.

214
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,950
So whether is it love or
the fame outside the palace...

215
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,210
I gave them all up.

216
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,510
But you...

217
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,410
Because of that girl...

218
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,500
wants to give this all up?

219
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,650
Father...

220
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,140
Isn’t the one you love.

221
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,650
Don’t insult your father.

222
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,990
He is the person I respects most in this world.

223
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,330
Respect and love are different.

224
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,600
Just like how friendship and love is different.

225
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,710
You didn’t choose that person.

226
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,380
This is the worse mistake in your life.

227
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,090
What are you talking about?

228
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
If...

229
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,970
You and that man lived together
in a nameless village.

230
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,140
Mom would definitely live more beautifully and more happy than how you live now.

231
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,170
I am going to see Chaegyung now.

232
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,720
This is not something you can solve by holding your stand, this is my suggestion.

233
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,040
If you get involved, things will get worse.

234
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,300
I will solve this matter by myself.

235
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,440
I wouldn’t let you suffer alone.

236
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,280
Yul Goon.

237
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,590
I am always leaning on Yul Goon.

238
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,800
Even though I can't accept your heart.

239
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,240
I also want to...

240
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,730
Have a chance to protect Yul Goon once.

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,840
Because Yul Goon is my friend.

242
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,550
Chaegyung.

243
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,270
After Yul Goon entered the palace,

244
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,160
Only after that you started
to get close to the royal family.

245
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,050
I don't want them to have any misunderstandings because of this

246
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,740
You've changed.

247
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,730
Is it?

248
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,340
Living in the palace...

249
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,940
I have a lot of realizations.

250
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,600
I know if I want to live as a royal,
I have to do this.

251
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,490
I used to think that as long as I have Shin Goon.

252
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,600
I can get used to the life in the palace easily.

253
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,110
But...

254
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,300
It seems that it is not like that.

255
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,640
Perhaps it's because the relationship between shin Goon and I is not well.

256
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,160
I feel that the palace is suffocating...

257
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,840
I can see that I...

258
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,550
Am not suitable to be Cinderella.

259
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,370
The internet says the Crown Princess looked for another man.

260
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,270
You saw it?

261
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,700
I don't care.

262
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,050
Is it?

263
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,990
Then you can just expose who the person is.

264
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,830
Like that Yul Goon will get hurt.

265
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,810
You're still worrying about that guy?

266
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,420
Want to protect him like some precious treasure?

267
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,810
Shin Goon, stop it.

268
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,270
I am very tired.

269
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,730
I received so much from Yul Goon.

270
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,990
But I can give him nothing.

271
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,520
I can't give him my heart.

272
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,690
So even if it is like this,
I still want to give him something.

273
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,930
You protect him like this and you dare to say you didn’t give him your heart.

274
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,280
I find this so touching.

275
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Is Shin goon someone who gives up his heart easily?

276
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,090
I am sorry but...

277
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,930
I cannot do it.

278
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,250
I have already gave my heart to someone else so I can't give it to him.

279
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,990
Because Shin Chaegyung only has one heart.

280
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,780
Stop talking about nonsense like how the heart is and the feelings are.

281
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,470
You listen to my words carefully.

282
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,140
It can't be Yul.

283
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,430
Stop creating such dirty fates in the palace.

284
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,320
Dirty fates?

285
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,010
You see Yul Goon and me like that?

286
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,220
I don't mean it like that.

287
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,820
Getting hurt will cause someone to become cruel.

288
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,530
I can understand that.

289
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,940
But...

290
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,490
What I can't believe is...

291
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,680
You're even more cruel than him.

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
What is it?

293
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,380
I can't believe you actually ask me out.

294
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,410
I already warned you that people are watching and get you to be careful.

295
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,220
Do you want to hit me again?

296
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,300
As long as you wish,
whatever you do to me, I will take it.

297
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,980
Do NOT appear in front of
Chaegyung in the future.

298
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,840
By then, I will not let this go.

299
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,510
If I say I cannot do that?

300
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,210
This is for you and also for Chaegyung.

301
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,700
And also for me.

302
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,620
And also... for the royal family.

303
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm not the Crown Prince, I don't want to take the responsibility of the royal family.

304
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,910
But...

305
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,980
For Chaegyung, I will tell you this.

306
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,470
Do not let Chaegyung has anything to do with the palace anymore.

307
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,400
Let Chaegyung go.

308
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
You don't know...

309
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,990
What kind of fate are we immerse in?

310
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,230
If that is a kind of fate,
then let it end with us, this generation.

311
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,980
What do you mean?

312
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,360
Don't forget.

313
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,020
Whether is it your fate or mine,

314
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,370
We have to end it.

315
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,000
The recent news reports about Bingung hasn’t been subsiding.

316
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,410
When we stated that she was together with her father,

317
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,520
That guy who stole the car immediately announced that the guy he saw was a young man.

318
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,940
How? It seems that this cannot be solved easily.

319
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,360
So it seems that Bingung is lying?

320
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,390
It's not like that.

321
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,550
Bingung doesn't have to do that.

322
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,410
Also...

323
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,440
That person could have mistakenly seen it.

324
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,890
Anyways, the facts don’t match.

325
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,590
What is going on?

326
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,750
Why did Bingung lied to us?

327
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,070
I am sure she has her reasons.

328
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,750
If it is not her father she was with, then who is it?

329
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,360
No matter how much I think,
I can't let this pass like this.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,160
Where is Bingung now?

331
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,310
It seems that she is at her place.

332
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,400
What to do?

333
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,930
What am I supposed to do?

334
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,220
Where is Bingung Mama?

335
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,140
She's in her bedroom.

336
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,790
Report an entrance now.

337
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,390
Mama, Hwang-Hu Mama has arrived.

338
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,630
What have you been doing!

339
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,250
A person in charge of Bingung's education.

340
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,670
How did you educate her to
let her have endless scandals!

341
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,960
I am very sorry, Mama.

342
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,730
Bingung, sit down.

343
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,230
Sit down.

344
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,420
You tell me the truth now!

345
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,640
Who were you with and let things get to this stage?

346
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,100
You still refuse to speak up?!

347
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,590
I am sorry, Hwang-Hu Mama.

348
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,580
You cannot say it right?

349
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Bingung Mama.

350
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,170
This is not something you can solve by hiding it.

351
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,030
Please tell the truth.

352
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,770
Don't tell me, it's Yul Sung Dae Goon?

353
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,790
Yes.

354
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,500
You think if you shut your mouth you can hide it from the world?

355
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,960
You dare lie to the elders...

356
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,370
Are you trying to put the royal family down!?

357
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,590
I am really sorry, Hwang-Hu Mama.

358
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm afraid that Yul Sung Dae Goon might be implicated because of me.

359
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,980
This is totally ridiculous.

360
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,910
I've already gave Yul Sung Dae Goon such advices..

361
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,330
The position of the Queen...

362
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,310
You have to appear perfect towards the public.

363
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,780
And you have to be a wife towards the family.

364
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,880
Do you understand this or not?!?

365
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,350
I'm asking you something!!

366
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,380
Yes, Hwang-Hu Mama.

367
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,460
You know and you do something as careless as this,

368
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,370
are you trying to smear
the reputation of the royal family?!?

369
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,230
After Teaching you so intensively..

370
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,410
You are still far from being
the ideal Crown Princess!!

371
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,870
If this goes on,
how are you fit to be the Queen!?!

372
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,010
I am sorry.

373
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,240
This matter with Yul Sung Dae Goon, can't be spread out to the outside world.

374
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,770
Listen up.

375
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,560
Yes, Mama.

376
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,520
Whatever you heard today must absolutely cannot be leaked out.

377
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,790
Do you understand?

378
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,010
Yes, Mama.

379
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,920
Regarding this matter,
may I have something to say?

380
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,840
Regarding this matter, it's not something that the Crown Prince should be involved in.

381
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,670
I want to be alone.

382
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,430
What is the exact reason for the rebuilding of the building that has nothing wrong?

383
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,230
Other than the sudden order for rebuilding.

384
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,460
There wasn’t anything else mentioned.

385
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,870
Having the position of the Crown Prince, he can really see pass everything else.

386
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,560
He thinks I will sit back and do nothing?

387
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,330
Myong Sung Dang is not a place where you can do whatever you want with it.

388
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,340
Kwak Sang Gong.

389
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,350
Request for the Crown Prince to meet me.

390
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,160
Yes, Mama.

391
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,350
Be quiet. Quiet, quiet!

392
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,860
Why do you all get so noisy when assignments are mentioned.

393
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,140
You don't like assignments?

394
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,460
Yes.

395
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,250
But you have to graduate.

396
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,340
It seems that you all got the peter pan disease (not willing growing up).

397
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,680
Since we mentioned about graduation assignments...

398
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,500
Let's talk about our dreams.

399
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,730
Who wants to speak about dreams?

400
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,980
Me!

401
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,290
A good wife and mother.

402
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,980
Why do you all have to laugh at her wanting to be a good mother and wife?

403
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,670
A good wife and mother.

404
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,990
That is a bit old fashion.

405
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,850
That is too much. Really.

406
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,250
Kang Hyun?

407
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,050
I want to pursue the stage arts.

408
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,990
Stage arts...

409
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,040
Don't tell me you want to become an actress?

410
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,760
Then, Bingung Mama?

411
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,760
Yeah?

412
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,630
My dream is..

413
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,640
Oh~ in the future...

414
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,910
When you become the queen...

415
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,150
Remember to take good care of us dreamers here. understand?

416
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,340
Yes.

417
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,480
For those who have not decided I specially,

418
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,210
Prepared a poem.

419
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,190
So you all have to listen to it carefully from the start to the end. No falling asleep.

420
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,660
The title is, "The Dream of A Seagull."

421
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,660
My foot does not separate from the ground.

422
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm simply afraid.

423
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,320
I'm afraid to fly to the sky.

424
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,350
Because I'm used to the ground, sky is unfamiliar place.

425
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,800
Don't I have the wings?

426
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,030
Don't I have the dreamer before?

427
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,600
"The Dream of A Seagull"

428
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,070
Next week, it's the second part to dreams.

429
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,180
Prepare all your dreams.

430
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,950
Yes.

431
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,880
That's it for today.

432
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,600
[Dreams]

433
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,810
I'm going overseas to study.

434
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,320
So you're really going to go?

435
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,160
You will become a successful ballerina.

436
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,360
It may seems that I'm being a busybody but...

437
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,060
You aren't someone who will become a puppet.

438
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,140
If you can get out of the palace...

439
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,740
Hope that you will continue to design.

440
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,610
That time, on Shin's birthday, you gave him a pair of sport shoes.

441
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,140
I think that it was really beautiful.

442
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,040
Whether it is the design or the workmanship...

443
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,070
You really think like that?

444
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,960
I am going.

445
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,870
Hyorin.

446
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,650
If one day we meet again...

447
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,520
By then...

448
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,930
We will become friends right?

449
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,320
One day, hurt will also change into memories.

450
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,930
If we really try our best...

451
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,160
There will be such a day right?

452
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,920
I found a way for you to run away from the Palace.

453
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,480
A way that your family and loved ones would not feel any burden,

454
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,030
and that the citizens of Korea would easily accept your divorce.

455
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,970
What are you talking about?

456
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,400
- A divorce? I'm still..
- Don't lie.

457
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,560
Even if it's not worth a divorce,

458
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,150
I know you're having a hard time in the Palace.

459
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,260
I know by looking at your gaze.

460
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,480
Still, it's not the right time.

461
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,520
- If I wait a little longer...
- If time passes by it'll be hard to get a divorce.

462
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,380
As time goes by, the girl we all know as
Shin Chaegyung will slowly disappear.

463
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,220
You're going to become the Queen
with the fake smile and the rough life.

464
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,070
That's not going to happen.

465
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,850
You're already changing.

466
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,780
The Palace was unfamiliar to
you in the beginning, but...

467
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,660
now the outside world is becoming unfamiliar.

468
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,920
That's unavoidable.
It's not like there's any other way.

469
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,520
No.

470
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,250
You have an opportunity.

471
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,440
If you miss this,
you'll never have another chance.

472
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,660
An opportunity...?

473
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,240
The live interview.

474
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,860
That interview will be watched by millions of viewers across the nation.

475
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,740
Say that you want a divorce during that interview.

476
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,770
Yul Goon, that's foolish.

477
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,410
If I do that, I'm going to make a mockery of the Imperial Household.

478
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,910
If you lose this chance
you'll never be able to divorce.

479
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,920
What is the reason for renovating the library?

480
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,260
I found out recently that there was a
building that was out of use in the Palace.

481
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,850
But because the place is so worn out, I feel
that renovating this would make it better.

482
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,610
Even though the place is an abandoned building,

483
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,400
so it is filled with precious memories.

484
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,750
Also, the building's condition is not as bad as it seems.

485
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,590
Is there a special memory
that you keep within the library?

486
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,490
I read many books there when I was a young boy,
so I have many cherished memories there.

487
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,110
I didn't know that you had such memories there.

488
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,240
Whether those memories are still of value,
that building is too worn out and dangerous,

489
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,600
so please give me permission to renovate it. I'll leave now.

490
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,270
What did you find out about the man
that was with the Crown Princess?

491
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,700
She was with her father at home.

492
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,100
The whole world knows that she was with
a younger man. What are you talking about?

493
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,170
I believe the Crown Princess more than any rumor.

494
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,790
This is not a trifle problem to overlook.

495
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,740
The Crown Princess is not the kind of person to
leave her marriage and be with another man.

496
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,450
- Gong Nae Gwan.
- Yes, Pyeha?

497
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:57,000
Why do you think the Crown Prince is trying to renovate the building suddenly?

498
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:09,500
He recently asked me about the library,
but I am not sure of the exact reason.

499
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
It's that so.

500
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:20,860
Even though he is my son, sometimes I can't
understand what is going through his mind.

501
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,890
What brings you all the way here, Tae-Hu Mama?

502
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,910
I had to speak with you in person.
Are you ignoring my words?

503
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,760
I don't think that there's anything
to talk about between us.

504
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,790
Is that so?

505
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,090
Then I will ask of you one question.

506
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,280
Please go ahead.

507
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,200
Why are you renovating the library?

508
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,030
It's not a place that you should meddle with.

509
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,330
That's weird.

510
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,600
My father also had a special interest in the library.

511
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,820
For both of you to think the same thoughts
seems to be more than just a coincidence.

512
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,900
It is a building that the late King built.

513
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,640
It's not yours.

514
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,640
I own the land that the library is on,

515
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,090
and when the Crown Princess becomes of age,

516
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,980
it will become hers as an Imperial gift.

517
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,870
Even if that is your first intention,

518
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,600
what reason is there for you to renovate that building?

519
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,560
You are wasting the citizen's money!
What do you think you're doing?!

520
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,620
Are you curious why I'm renovating the library?

521
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,030
Because I find it dirty.

522
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,250
Finding the evidence of
passion all around that place,

523
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,650
It made me feel so disgusted.

524
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,730
If you were going to have an affair,
you should have kept it well hidden.

525
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,670
Carrying the beautiful appearance of
the Crown Princess,

526
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,400
But using scandalous ways to seduce each other...

527
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,350
Furthermore,

528
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,640
it's the country's Crown Princess and the 2nd prince in line for the crown.

529
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,970
Choose your words carefully.

530
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,820
Do you think you're the King already, Crown Prince!

531
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,410
I'll get you for this.

532
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,600
If you try to interfere in my business again,

533
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:29,930
I will send the passionate letter to
Yul Sung Dae Goon.

534
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,790
That insolent boy. That insolent boy!
How dare he threaten me like that?

535
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,290
I'm going to going twist your neck sooner or later.

536
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,050
My intentions have been revealed,

537
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,190
but that will not bring me down.

538
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,040
Kwak Sang Gong, are you there?

539
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,650
- Did you call me, Mama?
- Call Choong ah right this instant!

540
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,110
Yes, Mama.

541
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,400
Please take care of this job for me carefully.
Don't get caught in the act.

542
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,350
Yes, I will get right to it.

543
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,460
Whenever I see you and the King,
I feel as if I am walking the wrong road.

544
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,140
Prince, there is no parent who win over their child.

545
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:45,400
Then, if you act more kind towards your father, he will open up to you.

546
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,400
I don't feel that I should pretend
in order to be closer with father.

547
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,810
Do you by any chance still have the
intentions of giving up the throne?

548
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,060
What do you mean?

549
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,030
Even though I couldn't raise you
lovingly in a normal home,

550
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,480
can't you think of the mother
who gave birth to you?

551
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,810
Whether it is all in your mind
that it is unfair,

552
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,370
or that you have second thoughts of living
in the outside world like a normal person,

553
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,200
or if it's because you just want
to let the Crown Princess go easily.

554
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,160
That's what I'm curious of.

555
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:43,780
However whatever reason it may be,
you must become the King.

556
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,830
For this is has been your own destiny...

557
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,380
And also, treat this as your mother's last wish.

558
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,450
Choi Sang Gong.

559
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,050
Where is the Crown Princess?

560
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,420
The Crown Princess has just left to see her parents.

561
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,980
What?

562
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:31,670
Oh right. Her parents are taking a vacation from work. Did she go there?

563
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,430
Yes, Prince.

564
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:42,300
Her parents started to work, so she was not able to see them. They are visiting her for the first time.

565
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:53,380
I don't know if this would an intrusion on their
meeting, but wouldn't you like to go see them?

566
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,780
Look at your face!
You look so distressed...

567
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,250
Chaegyung.

568
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,500
Are the Elders still nagging at you because of that press rumors?

569
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:15,750
Of course. If the Crown Princess has an affair, it's as if the world is turning.

570
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,070
Just tell your mom. Who were you with?

571
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,340
I thought we said we wouldn't
talk about that anymore!

572
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,300
Have some of the food.

573
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,710
- Isn't that good?
- Yes.

574
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,010
It's like the food back at home.

575
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,950
Now that I'm eating this,
I really want to go back home.

576
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,600
I remember when I used to sleep in your room,

577
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:58,430
and I remember when I was grumbling the first time I tried dad's food.

578
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,360
You gave up cooking. Remember Dad?

579
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,300
We ordered jjang myun for a whole week that time.

580
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,320
Yes. There was that time.

581
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,490
Chaegyung.

582
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,580
Our princess is having a very hard time...

583
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,740
Can't I go home?
Can't you just take me home?

584
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,030
No, we can't do that right now.

585
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,300
Why not? Why can't we bring her home!
She looks so weak and gaunt!

586
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,600
Listen to me.

587
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,870
Let's say that something happens to
you and you are forced to return home.

588
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,840
We, as your parents, might treat you
with hospitality and warmth,

589
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,820
but what about the rest of the world?

590
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,390
They will not be as accepting.
We can't live as we used to live.

591
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,620
- Mom...
- However,

592
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,010
If you think you're having too rough of a time,

593
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,830
and you can't take it anymore, then,
the last place you can come to for help is...

594
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,150
That won't happen.

595
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,470
Please, give up the idea.

596
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,750
I have no intentions of giving Chaegyung back.

597
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:35,050
Jeonha, we didn't have those intentions,
it's just that my child having such a hard time.

598
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,700
Your child?
This is the Palace.

599
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,150
It may be a bit of a stretch for you, but please
use proper terminology when you're here.

600
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,300
As the Crown Princess's advisor,
I shall inform you of the Palace's law.

601
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,190
The terminology used in the palace
is very important.

602
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,390
Since you have entered the Palace,
please properly use the terminology.

603
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,370
To add on, the Crown Princess has lost her senses too
many times and has created a problem for many people.

604
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,260
If you try to persuade her to go back home,

605
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,380
it will only confuse her of
her duties as a Crown Princess.

606
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Anyway, the Crown Princess will not have any reason to go back home.

607
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,140
Then, we will take our leave.

608
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,700
Bingung Mama. Please, go on up.

609
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,690
Yes, Bingung Mama, go up.

610
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,390
Let's go.

611
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:58,070
I'll come again.
You have to come more often?

612
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,920
What's the matter!

613
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,330
How could you do that to my parents?!

614
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,110
So what if you're the Crown Prince?!

615
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,940
I don't want to hear your nagging that you wanted to go outside the Palace anymore.

616
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,420
I want to get out,
I really want to get out of here!

617
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,600
Then what should I do? I need you.

618
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,480
I don't want to give up the throne anymore.

619
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,300
I want to try to become the perfect King now.

620
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:07,500
If I want to do that, I need you to stay by
my side, and lie to the camera if you have to.

621
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,300
Then what you're saying is that you
need a Crown Princess, not me, right?

622
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,240
Can't you stop thinking like that?

623
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,960
I need something too.

624
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,600
I need someone who isn't selfish and avoid
those who they don't wish to see.... like you.

625
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,400
You're not stupidly thinking that we're going
to avoid each other if we divorce, are you?

626
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,090
The biggest victim will probably be your family.

627
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,800
What's that supposed to mean?

628
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,980
Isn't it obvious that the nation
will blame your parents for this?

629
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:53,460
They're the ones who decided to make the incapable wife
you are to marry me because of our grandfathers wishes.

630
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,070
That's impossible.

631
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:00,980
So stop complaining that you're stuffed up in
the Palace, and just deal with it.

632
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,560
You don't know how it feels. You don't
know how difficult it is to live here for me!

633
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,410
I have to make sure I'm following every
single rule of the Palace, and I have

634
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:13,030
to live up to the duties of the Crown Princess.
I just feel like I'm suffocating now!

635
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,470
Don't leave.

636
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,940
Don't leave me to deal with everything alone.

637
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,650
Yeah, Kyung?

638
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,250
Hyorin?

639
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,250
Yeah.

640
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,950
Yeah okay.

641
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,680
Hey,

642
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,880
Hyorin's leaving the country today.

643
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,630
Don't you want to go to
the airport with me?

644
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,550
You can go alone.

645
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,360
I don't want to go if you
don't go with me.

646
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,160
Don't be like that,
and just go.

647
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,130
I have a good reason for
not going there.

648
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:03,750
You guys have a lot of cherished times
together that I don't know about.

649
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:10,580
I think I'll just interfere with
your settling your past if I go.

650
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:21,500
It's okay, so just go without me.

651
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:30,480
Don't over-practice and have some fun.
Forget about the hard times you had here!

652
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,850
Go out with a handsome Caucasian man!

653
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,900
Hyorin! Your final goodbye!

654
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,850
I don't know why I got so greedy
when it all ended up this way.

655
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,340
Give my newfound life a blessing.

656
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,880
Shin.
You came...

657
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,300
I have to at least say goodbye.

658
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,260
I think I know now.

659
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,130
When everything in the world has been given
to you, you should give something back.

660
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:40,850
But I didn't even empty my hands,
so I had no hand to grab you with.

661
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:51,420
Now, I'm letting Lee Shin go and
putting Min Hyorin's dreams there.

662
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,150
Alright.
Goodbye Hyorin.

663
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,150
Goodbye.
My prince.

664
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,600
You were with Yul that time.

665
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,950
You don't have to be surprised.

666
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,300
You protected my son,
so I'm just giving you my gratitude.

667
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:08,030
It is only in the Imperial family that
it is hard to be out with your friends.

668
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,900
Yes.

669
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,860
It is not easy to live in the Palace.

670
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:20,700
You have to grasp many things, yet you
have many things to say. Isn't that so?

671
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,210
Yes... a little.

672
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,060
It may seem that you're adjusting
well now, but it will get much harder.

673
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,500
That's what happened to me too.

674
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:42,960
I could get on with life in the beginning,
but as time went by, I was struggling.

675
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,900
Is this really how to live?
Is this how I want to live my life?

676
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,500
I was not accustomed to life in the
Palace when I first came in,

677
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:00,510
but later I was not accustomed
to normal everyday life.

678
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,050
Is that so?

679
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:10,610
It was so hard that I even
thought of having a divorce.

680
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:19,760
I didn't want to live a fake life as a Queen
and I really wanted to live a normal life.

681
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,140
My simple "thank you" has turned into my life story.

682
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,300
Can you tell me more?

683
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:38,630
How was it after you left the Palace?

684
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,250
I found the door to heaven.

685
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,400
The door to heaven?

686
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,250
A real life.

687
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:58,700
I could dream freely, move freely, and feel freely. That kind of real life.

688
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,870
But I think that one needs immense
courage to leave the Palace.

689
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,950
In front of the door to heaven,
there is this message.

690
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:18,180
"Those who lack sense burn with sadness if they mistreat destiny."

691
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:25,120
If you want to find the door to heaven,
at least you need a certain amount of courage.

692
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:33,950
Because of our differences, maybe you
can find the heaven inside the palace.

693
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,100
What brings you here?

694
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,930
I was just having a conversation
with Tae-Hu Mama, I'm going to go now.

695
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:55,140
Tae-Hu Mama, thank you for your words.
I'll see you again.

696
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,700
I'm going.

697
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:10,830
Mom, what are you thinking of doing?

698
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,100
I'm only helping you.

699
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,300
Did you follow me?

700
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,970
Yeah.

701
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,700
What are you going
to say during the interview?

702
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,070
I'm still not sure.

703
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,050
Chaegyung. This is your last chance.

704
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:54,240
If you miss it, you'll never be able
to bring up the word divorce.

705
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,840
But if I bring up divorce,
Shin Goon's going to have a hard time.

706
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,070
I think I might just give up my freedom and spend
the rest of my life staying by the person I like.

707
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,300
You don't know what a hard life
the women in the Palace have!

708
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,980
They have to live by strict rules
and the pressure from the other royals.

709
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,250
There's no such thing as love in the Palace.

710
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,930
Even if you want to have a child, you
won't be able to raise it by yourself.

711
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:29,050
When your child turns three, they will
send him away to make him independent.

712
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,250
That's life in the Palace.
And more importantly,

713
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,850
it may look like Shin is opening his heart to you now,

714
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,300
but you don't know when he'll close it back up.

715
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,400
What Shin needs is not a person to love,

716
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,350
but a person to play the role of the Crown Princess.

717
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,050
That.. I already know.

718
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,950
Chaegyung.

719
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,300
A person lives to strive for happiness.

720
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,050
That's not a crime.

721
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,800
Talk about the divorce during the interview.

722
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
That's the best way.

723
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,380
Do you think talking about the divorce
during the interview is the best way?

724
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,740
Isn't there another way?

725
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,420
Probably not.

726
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,290
I'll think about it.

727
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,220
I still don't know what to do...

728
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,950
What my final decision is going to be,
the chances are at a 50/50

729
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,250
Gather up the courage to say it,
or don't do anything.

730
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,980
We're going in ten minutes.
Please get ready.

731
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,390
Yes.

732
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,550
- I have to go in now.
- Chaegyung.

733
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:17,970
- This is the last chance in your lifetime.
- But still...

734
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,590
If you say nothing and return to the Palace,
you'll never be able to leave the Palace.

735
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,340
Shin is not going to give up the throne.

736
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,310
I'm only thinking of what's best for you.

737
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,050
What are you doing?!

738
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,520
I knew it was you.

739
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,060
Do you still not understand me?

740
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,670
I don't know about anyone else,
but it can never be you.

741
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,270
Why are you hanging up other people's phones?

742
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,300
Listen to me.

743
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:51,300
If you really want it that badly, I can find a way.

744
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:56,260
But please, listen to my request.
Keep your mouth shut.

745
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,400
Did you perhaps... Already know about this?

746
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,950
Jeonha.

747
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,260
Let's go.

748
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,980
Yes, now I'll ask the question the whole nation wants to know.

749
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,150
It must have been hard to adjust to life in the Palace.

750
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:39,420
Yes, but with the help of my new family and my friendly advisors,

751
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,050
I've grown accustomed to my new life.

752
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,700
Yes. I don't know if this is an
appropriate question or not,

753
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:53,870
but the whole nation would like to know if
you will be having a baby. When will that...

754
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,650
Because we still are not of age,
people will have to wait.

755
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:07,020
There will be a time when we will
spread the good news to the nation.

756
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,250
What should I do?
This might be my last chance.

757
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,400
This question is also...

758
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,250
Well these are all from the nation,

759
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:22,810
but you two have married very young,
and have married due to a promise.

760
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,600
- Yes.
- Well, if that's so,

761
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,400
- Please excuse this expression, but...
- Yes, go on.

762
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:32,350
If you say it in today's terms, it would
be a marriage for political reasons...

763
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,940
After the marriage,
how are your feelings for each other?

764
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:44,980
Shin Goon, please say anything...
or else... or else I...

765
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,100
I have to say something...

766
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,300
I love her.

767
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,300
I love her very much.

768
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,450
Wait. Wait a sec!

769
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:45,450
I have something to say.

770
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,340
I'm trying to get divorce.

771
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,300
So the truth has been told.

772
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,980
There are many things in
the world that are unexplained.

773
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,950
Please think about the normal high school
girl who is filled with grief and loneliness,

774
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,150
who came into the Palace,
where she knew no one.

775
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:30,300
My last request is
that everyone will forgive us.

776
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,910
This isn't what I wanted.
