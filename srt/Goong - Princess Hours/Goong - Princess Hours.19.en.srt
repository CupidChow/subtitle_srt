00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,110
Episode 19

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,260
What are you doing?!

3
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,550
I'm letting you know that I'm your husband!

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,550
You are such a jerk!

5
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,950
Hey!

6
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,950
You only have two faces?

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,870
Please, just go.

8
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,550
I'm really not in the mood to see your face.

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,350
I know that I was a little harsh.

10
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,900
I think I lost my mind for a minute there...

11
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,390
Even if it weren't me,
and a guy was in that situation…

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Can't you just understand me?

13
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,550
You know how I get when something pisses me off.

14
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,910
I know that it wasn't right,
so can't you just let it go…

15
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,810
I'm speaking to you like this and all…

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,850
Get out.

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,500
Are you going to keep acting like this!

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm telling you that I'm sorry...

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,290
You only think about your own feelings.

20
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,090
You put yourself on top of everything
and everyone else.

21
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,330
You don't even care to acknowledge anyone's feelings.

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,630
You just don't care.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,140
I'm not your toy.

24
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,140
Whenever you're sad, happy, or angry. I'm not going to keep playing along with you…

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,550
Aren't you tired of talking like this?

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,340
Stop trying to say that you're
some kind of doll or whatever.

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,810
I just started, and you're telling me to stop!

28
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,080
You're seriously a weird person!
Do you know that!

29
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,480
It's always your way, if you do something wrong, no one has a say in that you did wrong!

30
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,450
If I make one little mistake, you're always trying to catch me like some kind of mouse!

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,960
Especially when it comes to Hyorin, when I ask you one little thing about her, you get pissed for no reason!

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,260
How long are you going to push me around like that?

33
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,600
Is that your catch on me!

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,230
Always trying to bring up Hyorin for every little thing!

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,550
What about you?

36
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,700
Why is that every time I mention Hyorin's name, you get all clammed up!

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,810
What?

38
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,740
You must misunderstood about something.

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,180
The incident at the party, you're the one who did wrong there!

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,090
If it were Hyorin, who was in this situation, you would have never acted so harshly!

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,160
I want to be alone right now.

42
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,310
I wasn't trying to act so harsh with you, I just…

43
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,710
I just don't know any other way.

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,370
So, did you all find out what it is that you wanted to do for graduation?

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,040
Yes, Mama. It was a great experience.

46
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,910
And was it a memorable birthday party for you, Dae Goon?

47
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,950
I had words in my heart for someone and I got the chance to express them at the party.

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,150
I am very thankful for that.

49
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,890
Words in your heart, you say...
It sounds so meaningful.

50
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,700
Can you tell me what it was
that you had in your heart?

51
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,970
I'm sorry, but I think it's going to be hard.

52
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,970
Those words were meant for that one person to hear.

53
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,410
It was meant only for that one person.

54
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,250
Oh, I see…

55
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,450
I'm so curious, but I'll just let it go for now.

56
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,990
Are you okay, Prince?
It seems that you look unwell...

57
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,830
Well, I didn't think the party was the greatest.

58
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,500
I had a friend who went over the top,
and shouldn't have.

59
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
Don't you think so?

60
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,170
Being that I invited you and had a bad time, I feel sort of bad about that.

61
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,170
I thought I had tried my best to make the party great.

62
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,880
It's okay, it was a party that had me on my toes.

63
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,510
Thanks.

64
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,180
Having the Prince and the Dae Goon not around in the Palace,

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,790
you do know that it's something
that shouldn't have been.

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,520
Yes.

67
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,990
Yes.

68
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,000
But I wanted you both to go and have a good time,

69
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,370
because of the wrongful act that had happened between you two.

70
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,810
I wanted you both to just leave
that incident behind you,

71
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,900
and come back as one,
you both know that, I assume.

72
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,920
You both are cousins, but in reality, you both are like brothers.

73
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,190
You both have to work together to bring the Hwang Sil together,

74
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,990
and you both have a lot of work ahead of you.

75
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:42,960
You both should be there for one another, and respect one another, so that your work can be done.

76
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,640
Everything that I have just spoken about, you both have already realized where this is coming from, do you not?

77
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,070
I'm sorry, Halma Mama.

78
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,910
You both must work together and be strong, so that the Hwang Sil will be kept.

80
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,420
I don't want my words to go forgotten,
do you understand?

81
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,930
The promise of the arrangement was with you, but now, it isn't like that.

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,070
We can't turn back time.

83
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,680
When I was about ten years old,

84
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,000
I was coming home from school...

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,530
my house was just so quiet,

86
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,900
sort of like you can hear the screeching on the doors, when you open them.

87
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,750
I couldn't find my mom.

88
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,250
I had some weird feeling, so I went up to her room.

89
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,910
I didn't see her in the room,

90
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,610
but I heard the water running in the bathroom.

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,750
I saw my mom there.

92
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,900
She was lying on the floor with her eyes closed.

93
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,100
Ever since that day, I've always felt scared.

94
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,370
Thinking what if my mom just left me,

95
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,650
How am I supposed to live...

96
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,100
What if she just left me like my dad had gone,

97
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,810
how am I supposed to live…

98
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,110
I was just so afraid that I wanted to die.

99
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,720
Bingung Mama!

100
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,730
Oy! You can't hear me?

101
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,270
Are you going to act like this forever?

102
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,270
Why do you keep running away from me?

103
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm not running away.

104
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,740
Don't meet up with Yul anymore.

105
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,600
It doesn't matter how much I tell him not to, because he won't listen anyway…

106
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,810
I think it's better for you to
just stop meeting with him.

107
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,220
Why do I have to do that?

108
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,380
Because it keeps messing with my head.

109
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,990
The whole situation of you being mad at me, it's all his fault at the end.

110
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't think about how Yul and I are with each other.

111
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,390
I'm your husband and your husband is telling you that he doesn't like it.

112
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,860
Why are you always looking out for him?

113
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,530
You have everything in the world.

114
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,070
What?

115
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,440
Yul is part of our family.

116
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,610
He's been through a lot, more than you have.

117
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,010
He's part of the family,
so we have to look out for him.

118
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,380
Why do I have to do that?

119
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,580
I can't even stand him!

120
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,690
Because he's part of our family.

121
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,190
No matter how much you hate them or fight with them, family always look out for one another.

122
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,830
My mom and dad both said so.

123
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,970
Whatever.

124
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,970
How long are you going to keep acting like that?

125
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm not trying to act like anything.

126
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,900
I just feel a little weird.

127
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,610
I just need some time.

128
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,470
A live interview, you say.

129
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,310
Yes, Mama.

130
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,050
It's an interview that is done annually for the people to get to know the royal family.

131
00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:01,090
Isn't it going to be where the people can ask anything they like, without our approval of the question?

132
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,230
Yes, that is how it is, Mama.

133
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,400
So what's the problem with that?

134
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,870
Please explain why this might be a problem.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Yes, Mama.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,150
I'm deeply sorry to say, but the problem with the King's health,

137
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,820
and the fact that the Prince is not a strong speaker.

138
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:41,650
I feel that it may be a problem, so I was wondering if you would like to just cancel this interview instead.

139
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:50,040
Do you not remember what the King had once said during our family dinner?

140
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,110
“We are with the people,
and we will work with the people.”

141
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,610
Why is everyone trying to
run away from all the obstacles?

142
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,350
I feel that my thinking was short on this matter, Mama.

143
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,800
Send the Prince and Princess out for this interview.

144
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,260
Mama...

145
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:18,390
I'm deeply sorry to say this, but the Prince is just not ready for an interview like this.

146
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,350
He may get nervous and I feel worried about it as well.

147
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,480
Also, if he gets asked a controversial question, he may not be able to answer in the correct way.

148
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:35,050
Especially since it's going to be aired live, it may leave a mark on the Palace.

149
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,420
That is why I am saying...

150
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,790
Please, just don't interrupt a person before they haven't finished speaking.

151
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,400
I wasn't even finished with what I wanted to say...

152
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,900
Just because it will be on live, it doesn't have to be such a scary thing.

153
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,940
There are many options for a live interview such as talk shows, or a comfortable meeting with the interviewer.

154
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,580
There're a lot of different ways
for this interview to go on.

155
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,080
But Mama, the Prince is not well prepared for interviews as such.

156
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:15,790
Plus this interview will be heard by people all over the world...

157
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,630
You all are just driving me crazy!

158
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,060
Just prepare him, that's all.

159
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,970
We can not just force him to stay behind closed doors.

160
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,240
The Prince and Princess
will make it through this interview.

161
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,730
What ever happened to my carefree friend, Shin Chaegyung?

162
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,550
I'm trying to figure that out as well.

163
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,550
What are you thinking about?

164
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,610
Am I living my life the right way?

165
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,810
What am I doing right now?

166
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,520
What? That's crazy talk.

167
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,390
You are going to get sick, from that kind of thinking.

168
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:28,860
With a head like yours, thinking all these hard, crazy things, you are going to end up with something!

169
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,770
Last time at the party,
Shin and you looked a little uneasy.

170
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,680
But from what I see,
it seemed like Shin really likes you.

171
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,250
I wonder, does he really like me?

172
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,350
Does he really like me?

173
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,060
I haven't really heard him saying that he does personally.

174
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,160
And if he really liked me, that's probably from the attachment.

175
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:11,070
Every morning seeing each other when we wake up, eating together, going almost everywhere together.

176
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,240
If you didn't know a person before, and you had to spend all that time with them,

177
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,480
you will probably feel some kind of attachment there.

178
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,850
When I don't see him,
I get so worried about him.

179
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,360
When he's away I feel so lonely,
and want to go find him.

180
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,220
It has to be that.

181
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,330
It's so unlike you, what's wrong?

182
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,770
I'm always crying because of Shin.

183
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm always hurting because of him.

184
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:54,920
I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to live my life in the Palace, watching Shin.

185
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,590
You've been doing fine so far.

186
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,450
Do you really think I can do it?

187
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,550
Can I be brave enough to live like that?

188
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,770
- I'm just wondering…
- Shut up!

189
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,830
I heard that your mom is
doing great with her insurance job.

190
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,100
Yeah, she's doing better than before. She's ranked in the millionaire club, in her job.

191
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,670
But there's been a lot of gossip going around that she's using your name to her advantage.

192
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,210
My aunt told me that there are a lot of people who don't like the way your mom's handling her business…

193
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,780
They're all jealous, that's why!

194
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,850
People just can't stand it when another person becomes successful with their lives!

195
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,790
But there's some truth in it as well. Who wouldn't want to get close to the Crown Princess?

196
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,190
Seriously, that's what the people are talking about?

197
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,530
Just don't pay attention to it!

198
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:17,170
Your dad is working now,
why don't your mom just retire...

199
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,040
If you hear gossip like that, you would probably feel weird about it.

200
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,310
But, there's also a lot of gossip about your dad as well,

201
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,710
saying that he's sort of like Narcissus.

202
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,210
But it's not like that, it's really not like that!

203
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,380
There's no point in going crazy about it!

204
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm worried.

205
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,250
My mom and dad, even though we were poor, they lived a humble life.

206
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,840
If you feel that the work your parents are doing is right, then don't go crazy about it.

207
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,510
There's always going to be people gossiping,
just let it pass.

208
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,990
I bet my mom and dad feel so hurt by it.

209
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,990
How can something that doesn't make sense become a rumor like this!

210
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,530
If you are living under the Hwang Sil,
it's this kind of lifestyle.

211
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,550
I'm getting worried that you might get lost in all this.

212
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,470
The Hwang Sil thinks that the law more important over people.

213
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,680
I wonder if you can survive the Palace lifestyle.

214
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm really unsure.

215
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,980
No matter how hard I try,
it doesn't seem like it's paying off.

216
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,320
Don't try.

217
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:48,280
You may think that you can handle it right now, it's only going to get harder and harder.

218
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,030
I wish that you can just live freely.

219
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,560
Yul Goon, is there something bothering you today?

220
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,250
No.

221
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,130
Really?

222
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,540
Let's go back inside.

223
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,540
Get our thoughts cleared out.

224
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,350
If you stay in the darkness,

225
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,980
they say that your thoughts will get cleared away.

226
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,310
No, it's okay.

227
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,820
Sure… Let's just go…

228
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,250
Are you okay?

229
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,250
Did you get hurt?

230
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,000
When did you come?

231
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,000
I hope I'm not taking your time here,
since your busy and all.

232
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,700
Where did you get hurt?

233
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,370
Whenever I do a turn, this seems to happen.

234
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,570
I've been practicing ballet a lot lately, so I guess my ankles aren't so strong right now.

235
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,420
That hurts…

236
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,530
Did you bring it?

237
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,660
I just came back from signing up from ballet school.

238
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,600
Really?

239
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,250
Hyorin, do you think that
I do everything my own my way?

240
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,610
Did you just figure that out now?

241
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,880
I spent a lot of time with you, I got to see what kind of person you are.

242
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:14,150
Chaegyung didn't have that chance, but that doesn't mean that my love is stronger than hers.

243
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:23,350
Just like how we're both so similar in our ways, and you and Chaegyung are different.

244
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,140
Shin, you really have
to acknowledge that about yourself.

245
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,510
You have to show Chaegyung your feelings.

246
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,950
We shouldn't have gone in there.

247
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,260
Lately, every time I meet up with Shin, we end up arguing.

248
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,630
When he acts nasty to me, I want him to just go away. But when he does go away...

249
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,390
I want to see him.

250
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,110
It would have been great if Shin felt the way I did.

251
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,920
If Shin had the same feelings toward you,

252
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,790
do you believe that your life
would be full of happiness?

253
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,920
That's just people getting greedy.

254
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:30,730
Time will stop soon,
doesn't matter how special that time is.

255
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:38,950
And when time does stop
, there won't be anything left over.

256
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,250
I'm just really unsure right now.

257
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,660
Like I told you before,
you can not live in the darkness.

258
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,100
That's right! This insurance policy will protect you from that darkness!

259
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,540
If it rains, this insurance is like an umbrella to keep you dry, and it'll just be there whenever you need it.

260
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:16,650
And also, this is a special promotional gift.
I got it especially for you, Tae-Hu Mama.

261
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,480
This is just so useful in cleaning up.

262
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,390
This is so special, I wanted you, Tae-Hu Mama to have it first. Please take a look.

263
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,190
-No, this way… this way…
-Please, just sit down.

264
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,190
Take a look! Isn't this so amazing!

265
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,260
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

266
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,170
Just sit down.

267
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,530
Oh, yes…

268
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,580
I know that you mean well,
the reasons for the insurance...

269
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,510
But don't you think it
can also mean something bad as well...

270
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,080
Something bad?

271
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,520
Living our lives in the light, and when darkness falls, we must learn how to like the darkness as well.

272
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:05,460
When rain does fall, you can just let the rain fall on you, isn't that life?

273
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,390
Hello there!

274
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,080
Hello, mother-in-law. What brings you here?

275
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,910
I was just showing your mother the insurance policies.

276
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,620
I thought that the Tae-Hu Mama would like to have one, but I guess not.

277
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,030
I'm still a student right now, so having insurance will be hard for me right now.

278
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,560
Once I get a job,
I will get insurance from you.

279
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,710
I mean, what kind of nonsense! How can you just go walk around having rain fall on you, don't you think so?

280
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,950
What did I tell you, there's just no chance to even get close to that woman.

281
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,350
Gosh, I remember when I felt sick watching her become the Crown Princess back then!

282
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,490
Now she just made me sick all over again!!

283
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,870
Let see if I'll give up! I'm going to stick to her like gum and make her get my insurance policy!

284
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,900
You'll see!

285
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,270
Okay!
Come a little closer...

286
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,310
I heard some of the customers talking.

287
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:32,080
They were saying that we were riding on Chaegyung's back to make a living.

288
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,350
What! What the…

289
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,490
Who the heck are saying those kinds of things!
Does that make any sense at all?

290
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,660
We have our feet to the ground,
working our butts off!

291
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,330
No matter who our daughter is married to, people shouldn't be saying all these things!

292
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,100
Just forget about those stupid rumors.

293
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,500
Don't go to the Palace trying
to sell your insurance anymore.

294
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,540
If our little girl heard the rumors,
she'll feel so bad about it.

295
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,350
If I would have known all this would happen, I'd never let her marry into the Palace.

296
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,090
I feel so bad for my little Chaegyung.
She must feel so lonely inside that Palace.

297
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,240
TaeJa Jeonha.

298
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,780
Jeonha, are you looking for Bingung Mama?

299
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,220
Oh, no.

300
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,490
Go on with your work.

301
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,230
I think he's embarrassed to say it...

302
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,540
You wait here.

303
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,870
Yes, Mama.

304
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,820
I heard you have been meeting Yul quite often recently.

305
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,850
He has a sharp mind and he is righteous child.

306
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,650
He is a good child I brought up in difficult environment in England.

307
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,750
Pyeha.

308
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,740
Please help Yul to find back his position.

309
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,840
Hye Jung Jong.

310
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,500
As a child, he was born to be the king.

311
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,040
This fact can't be taken away by the changing fate.

312
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,840
Regardless of who it will be,

313
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,990
the one who is more capable will become the King.

314
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,480
If that is that case, isn't that even clearer?

315
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,820
They both are young Princes.

316
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,660
They need more training.

317
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,290
How they overcome difficulties, that is the most important thing.

318
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,340
Pyeha, a line must be drawn between training and spoiling them.

319
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,110
The Crown Prince now, is not having a test or training from fate.

320
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,650
He is suffering the consequences of the mistake he made and he was spoiled.

321
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,720
My love, the one I can only look from a far.

322
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,650
You asked me how much do I love you...

323
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,950
my love is deeper for you, than anything else.

324
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,550
No matter how high it is,
my love can reach that height.

325
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,230
My love is more precious than any precious stone...

326
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,000
My love is more luminous than pearls...

327
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,220
The brightest in the whole universe,

328
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,000
Your lips that feel real and
holds pure messages from God,

329
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,150
How do I forget this?

330
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,790
You, who went into the arms of another.

331
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,750
I can only look upon helplessly.

332
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,390
Your expression is very dull, TaeJa.

333
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,820
Did you have fun at the party?

334
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,560
Yes, Tae-Hu Mama.

335
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,290
Yul had planned so many things,

336
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,220
and he has prepared a lot also.

337
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,350
Please take good care of Yul Sung Dae Goon.

338
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,750
It is as if his only friend is Bingung.

339
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,650
They hang around frequently, it makes me worried.

340
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,750
I hope that it can be like when you were young, the Crown Prince being his good friend.

341
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:24,250
As long as Tae-Hu Mama is willing, Bingung and I will try to be his good friend.

342
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,650
Regarding the artifacts missing overseas have been through a lot of discussions.

343
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,240
It seems like it has
more benefits than disadvantages.

344
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,190
The more the discussions,

345
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,950
the more attention will be given by the citizens.

346
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,900
Yes.

347
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,150
Regarding the returning of the artifacts abroad,

348
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,060
it is the responsibility that we must give our best.

349
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,640
One of the most important task.

350
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,230
Like when Prince William came for a visit last time,

351
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,930
To give our sincerity bit by a bit.

352
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,130
Then we will get a result.

353
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,220
Yes.

354
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:17,150
And the most classical Greek cultural relic,
Parthenon which was in the British Museum.

355
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,190
England actually refused at first, but they return them willingly at the end.

356
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,010
Until now I still can't believe it.

357
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,390
That's why, more efforts should be put in.

358
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,540
For China and Italy cases...

359
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,460
it is because both governments are determined.

360
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,140
They already gotten back a lot of their artifacts.

361
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,850
Representing our country, in the future,

362
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,370
will try the hardest for the return of the artifacts.

363
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,660
Yul Sung Dae Goon Mama
plans to focus his efforts on...

364
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,000
The plans that never achieved the mutual agreement with France...

365
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,940
For the Foreign library plans.

366
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,930
Yes.

367
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,450
Yul Sung Dae Goon is here to share my burdens, I am deeply comforted.

368
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,830
Pyeha, then I shall take my leave.

369
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,920
Please come here often if you have the time, Yul Sung Dae Goon.

370
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,260
Yes, Pyeha.

371
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,770
When facing Yul,
father's expression is filled with happiness.

372
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,280
It is totally different when he's facing Shin.

373
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,450
Regarding the returning of artifacts, it's already been a long time after I brought it up to the Crown Prince.

374
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,600
But you see, Yul Sung Dae Goon...

375
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,800
Seeing the difference in the efforts that was put in...

376
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,660
How can I not be happy about it?

377
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,450
Shin should be nervous then?

378
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,250
Yul Sung Dae Goon.

379
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,370
Have you seen the King?

380
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,270
Yes.

381
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,030
We discussed the opinions in regards to the return of the artifacts.

382
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,770
Yes, I see.

383
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,650
I feel that Yul Sung Dae Goon's social circle has broaden quite a bit recently.

384
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,250
I heard you even participated in Jong Jin's meetings.

385
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,250
Yes.

386
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,330
I've always wanted to pay my respects to the elders.

387
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,600
It happened to be the Jong Jun meeting, and so I went.

388
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,500
Yul Sung Dae Goon.

389
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,840
You are the 2nd inline after the Crown Prince.

390
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,840
Naturally, this will attract a lot of attention from the rest of the Royals.

391
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,920
Please don't forget this.

392
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,600
Hwang-Hu Mama.

393
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,600
The meaning of your words is to tell me not to have any thoughts about the position of the Crown Prince right?

394
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,620
Yul Sung Dae Goon.

395
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,990
How can you say something like that so casually and disrespectfully?

396
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,950
I feel that Hwang-Hu Mama deeply misunderstands me,
so that's why I am saying this.

397
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,780
Misunderstand?

398
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:18,510
I'm just doing what I think a Dae Goon should do, acting after thinking carefully.

399
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,220
Dae Goon.

400
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,470
Thoughts that are derived from careful thoughts will become greed.

401
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,390
I will remember what you taught me,
Hwang-Hu Mama.

402
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,050
Jeonha.

403
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,710
We're going to start on the lessons for the live interview happening a few days later.

404
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,600
Please be prepared.

405
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,830
TaeJa Jeonha.

406
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,970
Internal Officer.

407
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,090
Yes, Jeonha.

408
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,000
You mentioned that Myong Sun Dang is an empty area and it's not used at all, right?

409
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,400
Yes, TaeJa Jeonha.

410
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,100
Since when did that place not be used at all?

411
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,070
Since about 14 years ago.

412
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,250
No.

413
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,450
Or Is it in the past?

414
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,730
Jeonha.

415
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,450
It's time for one of your lessons.

416
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,360
Bingung Mama is waiting.

417
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,970
I understand.

418
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,350
Let's go.

419
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,620
We haven't done craft together
like this for a long time.

420
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,270
Like this, I feel like a student again.

421
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,550
That's right, you are a student.

422
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,200
A full time student, a part-time Crown Princess.

423
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,780
Shouldn't it be the other way round?

424
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,110
You have a student's pass, but you don't have a Crown Princess' pass right?

425
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,180
Kang Hyun is my friend but...

426
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,160
you are very clever.

427
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,940
But it can be like this right?

428
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,130
Of course.

429
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,180
First you have to warm up.

430
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,010
Second you have to warm up.

431
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,800
It's not like that.

432
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,160
First, you have to give birth to a boy.

433
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,190
Second, you have to give birth to a boy.

434
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,530
Isn't that right?

435
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,620
How can it be that way?

436
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,740
That's right, first, the task of the Crown Princess...

437
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,930
is to give birth to a chubby baby boy.

438
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,930
To continue to the line.

439
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,110
Chubby baby boy?

440
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,600
Chaegyung will cry.

441
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,060
Stop teasing her.

442
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,400
Move the mic over there.

443
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,390
Starting. Cue!

444
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,480
Good.

445
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,690
Action!

446
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,320
Cut!

447
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,370
Yah! Where's the camera pointing at?

448
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,050
Swan!

449
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,320
Kang Hyun!

450
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
Hi! Hi!

451
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,530
Hey!
Can you be more serious?

452
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,610
What are they doing?

453
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,900
It looks like they are filming a movie.

454
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,210
You will go blind if you look at him. Let's go.

455
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,100
Can you do this properly?

456
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,910
Let me take a look.

457
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,400
I know.

458
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,420
Yah, but Shin...

459
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,630
I say, it is impossible for you
to be a director in the future.

460
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,470
Anyways, you are the guy who will become king.

461
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,340
You better focus more on the screen.

462
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,700
I know.

463
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,250
Film it.

464
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,570
Camera, get ready.

465
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,570
Camera.

466
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,150
Filming.

467
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,470
Action!

468
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,770
It's great.

469
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,970
It's been awhile since we worked so hard together, I am so hungry.

470
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,170
Let us eat tokpokki?

471
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,580
I want to go together too.

472
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,000
You.. Is it okay?

473
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,240
Mama, it is time to return to the Palace.

474
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,850
Really...

475
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,830
Go. We'll go by ourselves.

476
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,610
Let's go.

477
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,950
Have a good trip Chaegyung.

478
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,280
Bye.

479
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,310
Let's go together...

480
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,660
Just for a while.

481
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,050
Mama.

482
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,450
I will be right back.

483
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,750
7 mins!

484
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,790
3 mins!

485
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,710
1 min!

486
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,300
So good.

487
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,970
Nowadays, why can't Auntie sell these rice cakes in front of the school gate?

488
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,690
That was one of my happiest places...

489
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,520
So happy~~

490
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,430
Auntie!

491
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,580
One more plate of blood intestines, and give us more of the pig intestines as well!!

492
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,610
Chaegyung, you'll have a stomachache like this.

493
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,690
You know how much I want to eat this?

494
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,800
Don't worry about me,
let me eat enough of this.

495
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,390
Stop eating.

496
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,460
Hey. They say you shouldn't disturb a dog when it is eating, what are you all doing?

497
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,050
When you have your interview, your face is going to be like a moon.

498
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,930
Our faces usually look twice bigger on TV than when it's face to face.

499
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,420
I've been wanting to eat this with you girls.

500
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,750
To whine together with you all...

501
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,730
To eat till our stomach explodes...

502
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,220
I didn't know that little things
like these were so precious.

503
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,450
So...

504
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,850
Don't stop me today.

505
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,540
OK. Eat all you want.

506
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,070
Eat up your fill without any complaints
before you go back.

507
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,620
The big one.

508
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,870
Big one?

509
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,090
What to do... The uniform is about to burst.

510
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,230
My stomach is going to explode.

511
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,580
Sorry.

512
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,220
I'm so full... can't breathe...

513
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,670
Hey, wait!

514
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,590
Chaegyung, we'll leave first...

515
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,700
Why? Where are you going?

516
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,560
What's wrong?

517
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,650
Is it good?

518
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,670
You really didn't eat less than you could.

519
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,170
Want some?

520
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,760
Sorry, but I have a resistance to this kind of things.

521
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,900
We are different after all.

522
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,350
The difference is so much.

523
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,700
The difference could not be reduced.

524
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:22,250
It's like a born Prince and a beggar.

525
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,280
The beggar can temporary pretend to be a Prince.

526
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:32,650
But, also can never become a real Prince.

527
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,830
What difference is there?

528
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,920
This kind of difference is nothing.

529
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,230
Is it?

530
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,660
Perhaps, the differences will never be reduced.

531
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,070
If they can never reduce then just leave it and continue to live on.

532
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,280
Jeonha.

533
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,400
The reporters have flooded over and they're blocking the road.

534
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,470
Since we always go straight
from the Palace to school,

535
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,650
never thought it will turn out like this.

536
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,250
Our peace and quiet can only end here after all.

537
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,450
The police guards will open up the road but there will be pushing.

538
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,280
Until we get on the car,
grab my hand and run.

539
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,740
How long more can I grab hold of your hand?

540
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,550
Are you okay?

541
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,290
Did you get hurt anywhere?

542
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,570
Do you want to go home?

543
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,570
Please turn back.

544
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,300
Yes, Jeonha.

545
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,850
Spend the night here.

546
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,120
I will take on the responsibility.

547
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,120
Is it really okay?

548
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,920
After all this,
it'll be more difficult to do it next time.

549
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,150
Shin Goon.

550
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,190
And also, keep this a secret to the elders.

551
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,440
Dad!

552
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,310
I said something good will happen today.

553
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,930
So our Princess came back.

554
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,240
Pig, you didn't bring back
anything from the Palace?

555
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,060
You should bring something back.

556
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,430
Where is mom?

557
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,390
Mom?

558
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,740
She was here just now.

559
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,240
Oh my, Chaegyung!

560
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,290
What is going on?

561
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,040
I missed you all so I came.

562
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,840
Is it okay to come back like this?

563
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,480
Shin Goon allowed me to come back.

564
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,690
Oh my. So well behave.

565
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,410
Pig.

566
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,090
Our Princess came back.

567
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,710
She came back...

568
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,890
Eat slowly. You'll choke yourself.

569
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,410
Mom gave me a car, I use it all the time.

570
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,880
Every time I sit in that car, I think of Mom.

571
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,310
That's why I give it to you.

572
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,290
Let you think of Mom every time you sit in it.

573
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,160
Even without it, I miss you everyday.

574
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,600
What about Dad? You don't think of dad?

575
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,210
You must think of your dad,
the way you think of your mom.

576
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,190
Do you think of me?

577
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,810
You have to think of me too.

578
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,490
Since there is competition for love,

579
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,250
I know that the piggy will only think of me.

580
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,150
No.

581
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,960
Daughters are most closest to Dads originally.

582
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,520
Are you kidding me?

583
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,220
Regardless of what you say...

584
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,920
I gave birth to her from my belly.

585
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,160
How can you all compete with the Mother?

586
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,870
Definitely she'll miss me more.

587
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,520
I know already.

588
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,800
Like the car, you have some control.

589
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,560
I will miss each one of you accordingly.

590
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,130
Why?

591
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,630
Don't like it?

592
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,560
It's not don't like it.

593
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,450
The days in a week are 7,
and if you just divide that in 3...

594
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,380
You can't divide that.

595
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,790
Then I will miss everyone on Sunday.

596
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,010
Then it's okay.

597
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,120
It is just nice.

598
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,290
Then it is just nice.

599
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,910
Anyways, people from our house are really senseless.

600
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,150
Yes, 2 days for each,
Sunday for everyone.

601
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,560
It is okay like that.

602
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,010
Eat slowly.

603
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,060
Eat more.

604
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,950
You really want to sleep here?

605
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,000
This have been allowed already.

606
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,530
All four of us,
we shall sleep together in a room.

607
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,400
That's really old-fashioned.

608
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,940
If this was seen by others, people will think that this is some perverted family.

609
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,500
You jerk, then you go back to your room and sleep.

610
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,990
I don't want to. Sleeping together with the pig, putting my legs on her, this is so comfortable.

611
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,340
So heavy.

612
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,590
I haven't dig your ears for a long time, how about I do it for you now?

613
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,460
I kept feeling that I can't hear.

614
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,220
This can't do.

615
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,610
Chaegyung, you return to the Palace.

616
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,230
Why??

617
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,480
I don't want to,
I want to sleep here for a night before I go.

618
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,400
I am allowed to sleep here.

619
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,940
They say once you get married to that place you belong there.

620
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,590
No matter how I think I feel insecure.

621
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,660
You go.

622
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,970
What is wrong with you?

623
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,330
Our Princess hardly comes home once.

624
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,480
Be more understanding.

625
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,690
We are happy of course.

626
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,500
But if the people in the Palace knows it, Chaegyung will be the unlucky one.

627
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,630
Now, she is not our daughter,
she is the Crown Princess.

628
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,070
Ah didn't brother-in-law allow this already?

629
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,950
Quickly go.

630
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,030
Is a Royal a normal citizen?

631
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,250
Don't allow people to catch your tail.

632
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,220
Go back.

633
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,390
Go.

634
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,910
Chaegyung.

635
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,730
Your mom's words make sense.

636
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,160
Please don't feel any resentment.

637
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,310
Be careful on the way.

638
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,950
Yes. Chaegyung.

639
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,870
Since you already married into the Palace, there are a lot of things that can't be controlled.

640
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,440
You have to follow the Palace rules.

641
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,370
I don't want to go back to the Palace.

642
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,140
This child. Saying this will get you into trouble.

643
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,040
I still feel that this place is my house.

644
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,450
No.

645
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,290
Your house is the Palace.

646
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,600
Understand?

647
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,250
Quickly go.

648
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:18,860
Understand.

649
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,070
I am going.

650
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,240
Chaegyung.

651
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,960
It is very late, Bingung Mama.

652
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,930
Now the Queen is looking for you.

653
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,750
Looking for me?

654
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,960
Yes, Mama.

655
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,410
It seems that she knows about you going back to Sam Jong Dong.

656
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,750
What?

657
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,910
She can't find you and is very angry now.

658
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,200
Bingung Mama came back in a taxi,

659
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,410
because you passed the security, the news got to the Queen.

660
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,360
I'm really sorry Mama.

661
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,790
Since you are already the country's Crown Princess, you must forget your family.

662
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,200
How can you fuss about going back every time you have free time?

663
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,180
To add on, you didn't even report and went back.

664
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,500
If Bingung didn't break the Palace rules...

665
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,760
how can you do such a thing?!?

666
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,230
I'm at fault, Mama.

667
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,000
Please allow me to say something, Hwang-Hu Mama.

668
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,190
Bingung Mama didn't do this on purpose.

669
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,920
It is the Crown Prince
who allowed her to go back for a day.

670
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,360
Even if this is the case...

671
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,740
Seeing when you want to see,
going when you want to go...

672
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,750
How can you follow the Palace rules?

673
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,300
After all these time you should already be familiar with the Palace rules.

674
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:27,580
Bingung is still the same when you first came into the Palace. This is really disappointing.

675
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,580
I'm really sorry.

676
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:37,190
If this problem happens again,
I will punish you severely.

677
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,390
Yes, Hwang-Hu Mama.

678
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:44,180
I will increase your bodyguards.
Have a limit in your heart.

679
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,810
Choi Sang Gong, stay behind.
Bingung, you may leave.

680
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,520
Yes, Hwang-Hu Mama.

681
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,670
I allowed this.

682
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,970
And being so strict with Bingung who rushed all the way back in the night...

683
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,710
then where is my stand?

684
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,980
TaeJa.

685
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,640
Is this the time to discuss
where the Crown Prince stand?

686
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,010
The person who should remind her of the Palace rules, helped her instead.

687
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,590
What is the Crown Prince thinking?

688
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,970
It's not helping her, just giving her a "breather".

689
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,700
A "breather"?

690
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:06,370
She is more carefree and
more cheerful than anyone else.

691
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,820
This kind of person in the Palace where rules are so strict and inflexible.

692
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,480
How suffering is that...?

693
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,720
I wish you will care more for her.

694
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:20,790
But that, is also the important key point Bingung must overcome...

695
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,570
Once she used to go back to her family, it'll be more difficult to get used to the life in the Palace.

696
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,080
Shouldn't the Crown Prince
be very clear about that?

697
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,270
Silly girl~

698
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,480
Kind enough to allow you go to home.

699
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,250
You can't even do this well.

700
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:56,770
If you must come back by yourself, at least give me a call and everything will be fine.

701
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,820
Now Mother knows about this, affecting me as well.

702
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,850
You have to say these things to feel good?

703
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,740
At this kind of moment,
can't you just comfort me?

704
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,450
I don't know how to.

705
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,350
And also, comforting doesn't solve the problem.

706
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:20,720
People comfort each other.

707
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,620
Even though it doesn't solve the problem...

708
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,570
But it can make the heart feel better.

709
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,290
Because that is also a form of support.

710
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,510
Hey! Do you have to...

711
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,770
Say it out loud?

712
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,100
Just say, "Chaegyung are you okay?"

713
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,210
Just one sentence will do.

714
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,900
Sometimes,
I also need some comfort from Shin Goon.

715
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,080
But...

716
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,420
The comfort I got is from someone else.

717
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,650
Don't tell me...

718
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,440
it's from Yul?

719
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,720
What is it that I can't do compared to Yul?

720
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,450
Let go.

721
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,140
Say it.

722
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:14,530
At the least I want to know the reason.

723
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,430
At the least Yul Goon treasures the person's heart and thoughts.

724
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:23,600
That's why you look for Yul
every time you face a problem?

725
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,640
To let Yul comfort you right?

726
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:30,910
Forget it.

727
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,930
I haven't finished yet.

728
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,200
I'm really curious on how you're so good at hurting someone's heart.

729
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,370
I'm going out for fresh air.

730
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:50,600
Where are you going?

731
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,730
I'm always giving you trouble.

732
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,800
Is it because of Shin again?

733
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,020
Every time you cry...

734
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,430
I'll be very sad.

735
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,590
My both hands are being tied down.

736
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,510
Nothing I can do... so pitiful...

737
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:05,330
No, Yul Goon does it very well.

738
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,180
Always giving me comfort...

739
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,150
Lending me your shoulders...

740
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,810
It's like...

741
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,870
someone I know for a long time.

742
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,920
We...

743
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,830
Before we met...

744
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:30,520
There is already an invisible line that tied us together.

745
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,680
Chaegyung.

746
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:44,510
Don't get hurt again,
don't cry again, just leave the Palace.

747
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,510
Return to the place you used to live.

748
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,370
What do you mean by that?

749
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,720
No matter how much you like Shin...

750
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,630
It's just not possible for you to be suitable for him.

751
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:57,620
In the end...

752
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,790
You will only get hurts all over.

753
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,920
Therefore, before that happens, just run away.

754
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,800
Before everything can't be turned back anymore.

755
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,510
It's too complicated.

756
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,720
It's really too complicated.

757
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,260
Your heart will release you.

758
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,240
The car's not here!

759
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,980
No car!

760
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,520
If there's any need, please call anytime.

761
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,140
Thank goodness.

762
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,430
It scared me so badly.

763
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,340
The other car that was together with you...

764
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,450
It's Yul's car right?

765
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,340
So, did your feelings get comforted?

766
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,340
Don't forget to be discreet.

767
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,600
Cousin-in-laws having a date in
the middle of the night...

768
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,410
That will give lots of reasons
for people to misunderstand.
