00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,750
Episode 3

2
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,620
This Eun-young palace from right now.
It was 140 years ago,

3
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,260
in 1866 when myung-suh received training.

4
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,100
This place has a deep meaning.

5
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:24,560
I congratulate you,
Shin Chaegyung to be able to receive training here.

6
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,230
What?

7
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,020
Put it on the side.

8
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,550
Shin Chaegyung,
these are the materials you need to study.

9
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,180
What? All of that?

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,290
To eat is to "dine".

11
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,240
To cry is to "weep".

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,100
To rinse is to "gargle".

13
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,560
To wash face is to "wash and dress".

14
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,300
To be sick is to "be under the weather".

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,430
Why are they making everything complicated
by saying it differently?

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,630
They should just say it as how it is written.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,650
I'm going crazy!
How am I going to memorize all of this?

18
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,750
The Queen has arrived!

19
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,270
Where can I possibly start
to teach this girl?

20
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm sorry, your Highness.

21
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,870
I told the students to take care of her.

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,560
Please wake up.

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,300
You have to wake up.

24
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,940
Stop it.

25
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,080
- Please wake up.
- Please wake up.

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,860
Mom, I just want to sleep a little more.

27
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,390
- You have to wake up.
- Just leave her alone.

28
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,360
She must be tired.

29
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,000
She probably didn't get any sleep.

30
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,930
Nothing must go wrong with
the wedding etiquette,

31
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,930
so that the Bride fetching
ceremony can go on smoothly.

32
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,770
She makes a lot of mistakes so train
her well to be a Princess.

33
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,870
Yes, your Highness.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,030
And furthermore, let her realize that the
palace rules are extremely strict.

35
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,560
Yes, your Highness.

36
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,090
Note down carefully the things she learned,

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,860
the things she did right and
the things she did wrong

38
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,000
during her training time.

39
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,650
I have high expectations of your skill
of doing this during this time of training.

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,980
Yes, your Highness.

41
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,850
Where did she go?

42
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,800
Did you happen to see the Princess-to-be?

43
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,860
Where did she go?

44
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,520
We're in trouble!
We're going to get scolded for this.

45
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,430
What do we do?
If we get caught by Sang Gung Mama.

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,310
We're dead. I can't believe this!

47
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,200
What are you two doing?

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
You immature fools!

49
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,760
The thing is..

50
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,860
I told you take care of her.

51
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,100
But look at what happened!

52
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,130
Do you think the palace is your playground?

53
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,860
We're sorry.

54
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,920
That's not it, Sang Gung Mama.

55
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,080
It wasn't their fault, it was my fault.

56
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,030
No, none of it is your fault.

57
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,230
Who is she?
She is going to be our future Princess.

58
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,020
Are you going to mess up again?

59
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,070
No, it won't happen again.

60
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,710
It won't happen again.

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,130
- umm..
- Be quiet!

62
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,400
I will protect your faults for now.

63
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,090
The Dae Rae Bok to be worn on
the Bride fetching ceremony is ready.

64
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,390
Please go now.

65
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,080
Dae rae bok? What is that?

66
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
You'll know when you get there. Hurry.

67
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,870
Please go now.

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,860
I ask you how are you nowadays?

69
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,970
When the sun shines through the windows,
I yearn for you.

70
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,380
Even in my dreams I want to meet you,

71
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,360
If I could just see your footsteps forever.

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,920
The stone path in front of
the door has turned into sand.

73
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,830
Suh Sang Gong,
is there any news from Hye jung?

74
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,100
She's still finishing up some business in
England so she hasn't left yet.

75
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,670
Tomorrow the imperial household is
holding a big ceremony.

76
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,230
Wouldn't it be great if the
whole family could be here?

77
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,470
Hye jung doesn't think its time for that to come yet.

78
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,070
Suddenly separated from her husband by death, it was have been very traumatizing for her.

79
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,010
She was to become Queen but was kicked out of the palace because of the imperial law.

80
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,160
She must have so much pain and hurt in her heart.

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,950
Yes, your Highness.

82
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,320
When Majesty Hye jung thinks of Majesty Isang,

83
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,980
She heartbreakingly longs for you.

84
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,470
By the way suh sang gong, weren't you the nanny of both Prince Hyo Ryul and Prince Hwi Sung?

85
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes.

86
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,580
If things had gone according to those pictures..

87
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,170
Crown Prince, Hyo Ryul would
have already taken the position..

88
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:19,990
Both mother and son would be sitting on Queen's and Crown Prince's position as well.

89
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,510
There's no use talking about the past.

90
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,020
It's all useless now.

91
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:41,310
Since there's a big ceremony tomorrow,
I told you to rest today.

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,550
Since I was stubborn and it came out to this.

93
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,820
Okay I will listen to you, my wife.

94
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,580
Fortunately, you look a lot better.

95
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,970
Since I'm taking this medicine,
how can there not be good results?

96
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,240
But you have to still be careful.

97
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,740
There's no such dangerous illness such as this one.

98
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,050
Okay.

99
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,300
I'll be very careful so stop worrying about me.

100
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,480
How's the training going for the Princess-to-be?

101
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,010
She is receiving her training, but...

102
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,640
she can't grasp the basics so
it is very hard to train her.

103
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm worried about tomorrow's ceremony,

104
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,890
but I'm also worried how
we will train her from now on.

105
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,380
Don't think of her as someone inferior
and let's just train her at a slow pace.

106
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,740
This isn't a situation where we can allow
room with that thinking, your Majesty.

107
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:02,580
We had a lot of problems training our son.

108
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,180
And look at our son's behavior.

109
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,290
So therefore,

110
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm going to make sure there is
consistency for the Princess' training.

111
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,910
If you force the training on a child who
grew up outside of the palace too hard,

112
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,680
wouldn't the situation at the palace be hard for her?

113
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,800
The situation with the Princess is my job.

114
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,710
Concerning the Princess' training,
you have to leave it up to me.

115
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,430
You've worked hard on the training.

116
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, they've worked harder than me.
Is class is over now?

117
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,770
Yes. The training that was prepared for you is finished.

118
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,490
Starting from now,
you'll recite everything you learned at training.

119
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,370
What?

120
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,060
First off,
explain the etiquette for tomorrow's ceremony.

121
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,320
Everything?

122
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,800
Yes. Everything.

123
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:33,400
First, the King will confers rank and title of the Prince's legal wife.

124
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,410
Then I come to the eun-young palace,
then I receive the confer.. of...

125
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,940
- Confers of rank.. confers of rank..
- Confers of rank?

126
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,160
This isn't working.
Roll up your sleeves.

127
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,630
What?

128
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,920
I gave orders that there shouldn't be any mistakes.

129
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
What are you doing?
Roll up your sleeves now!

130
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,760
How dare you disregard the
Palace's laws and regulations?

131
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,730
Are you now trying to discredit
the Royal family's name?

132
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,750
Wait a minute,
I think I remember now.

133
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Oh, that's right.

134
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,880
After the confers of the Crown Princess ends,
I've to accept the title of the Prince's legal wife.

135
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,630
And then, the King will bestow the
ceremonial wine to the Crown Prince,

136
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
Before the Bride fetching ceremony starts
and lecture him on the Ancestors sayings.

137
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,290
After that, it's the Bride fetching ceremony.

138
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,680
the Crown Prince will then come to the
Eun-young palace from the Bae palace.

139
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,990
After the exchanges of the Pigeon ceremony ends,
he'll be taking the Crown Princess back to his palace.

140
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,030
Then, we'll accept the blessings of the
people as we ride through the streets.

141
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,990
After returning at the palace, the Prince and
Princess will go through the Tong Ne ceremony.

142
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,020
And it means the ceremony of the first night together,
after they eat and drink the ceremonial wine and food.

143
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,200
And then the whole wedding
ceremony will end here.

144
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,270
You did very well.

145
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,270
During that time I practiced a lot.

146
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,170
What? Jo-la?
What does that mean?

147
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,300
It means a lot.

148
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,240
Before you said it was cold,
how does it feel now?

149
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,610
I'm comfortable.

150
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,200
How did you like the new medicine.
Does it fit your to your taste well?

151
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,880
Yes, it does.

152
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,080
Then, I will go.

153
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,540
Your Majesty and Yi Sung Goon.

154
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,750
Both of you rest well.

155
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,080
Are you comfortable?
Do you feel at ease?

156
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,180
No, I'm totally uncomfortable.

157
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,430
Let's go.

158
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,710
Where?

159
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,840
To visit Chaegyung at the
Eun-young palace.

160
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,740
Let's go together. You said that she's
in the same class as you are.

161
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,490
No, I don't want to go.

162
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,070
If a pretty boy comes, she'll like it.

163
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,930
Go by yourself.

164
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,620
Since she must be tired after all that training.

165
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,730
She'll like it if your buy her some
chocolates or candies for her.

166
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,640
Do I have to buy stuff like that for her?

167
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,220
Shouldn't she be honored that
I'm at least visiting her?

168
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,450
You're going there to comfort her.

169
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,160
Since she's a girl,
she'll like stuff like that.

170
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,410
It's such a nuisance.

171
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,880
But, you know Chaegyung,
since she's a Princess now,

172
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,610
she wouldn't pretend to not know us, right?

173
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,710
Well, if it was me,
I wouldn't want to be around my friend .

174
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,340
Hey! If you make it like that, do you think you'll be able to see it on the streets?

175
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,460
That's why we prepared something.

176
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,690
We are the Princess' friends, Jisu-Sesu.

177
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,010
I'm Jisu.

178
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,690
I'm Sesu.

179
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,090
We are Jisu and Sesu.

180
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,150
I'm speechless.

181
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,360
They said no one could come in here.

182
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,280
Am I anybody?

183
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,350
I just thought I had to see what you
looked like before we got married.

184
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,660
Yul sent it.

185
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,450
You know Yul right? He's in your class.

186
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,660
Yul?

187
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,550
Who's Yul?

188
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,600
He said girls like that kind of stuff.

189
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,890
Since its obvious that you
can't eat stuff like that here.

190
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,490
He said if I gave it to you that
you'll like it so he packed it for you.

191
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,780
You weren't here crying because
you wanted to see you parents, right?

192
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,820
What is it?

193
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,830
No, it's nothing.

194
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,080
To be honest,
there is one condition for you for marrying me.

195
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,000
I asked for our quarters to be
in chang-dok palace.

196
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,270
Then your quarters will be far away from the elders.

197
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,180
And we'll receive less scrutiny from the elders.

198
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,900
So, about once a month you can
visit your parents without the elders knowing.

199
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,440
And what else was there..

200
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,520
You can invite your friends to
the palace for a party.

201
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh, this is good.

202
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,170
You can invite your family to the hwang-shil
resort and spend your vacation there.

203
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,240
Have you ever had an overseas vacation?

204
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,270
And what else was there?

205
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,710
Stop it.

206
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,000
I said stop it.

207
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,570
If that's how you're going to comfort me.

208
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,390
Okay,
this was what Yul wrote down for me.

209
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,060
What I can promise is just power.

210
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,170
What?

211
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,790
When I get a little older, when I can do things without anyone blocking my path.

212
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,260
And if by then you can't stand being here
and want to leave the palace.

213
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,880
I won't be able to stand a wife
that's longing for her mom,

214
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,330
I can let you go.

215
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,700
But I'm a Crown Prince to be a King.

216
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,040
Though I'm still young.
I know a divorce isn't easy to get.

217
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,360
So, just tell me right before you're about to really die,

218
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,550
because then I'll give you a divorce.

219
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,170
We have to give thanks to our father.

220
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,680
You start first.

221
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,360
You're doing all these peculiar things.

222
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,230
Father, just like you said.
Our Chaegyung is getting married.

223
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:11,310
I apologize for not believing in you
and ignoring when you told us about this.

224
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,080
Thanks to you we're saved, Father.

225
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:24,940
Please help Chaegyung not get into
any accidents in the palace.

226
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,350
Chaejoon,
say something to your grandpa.

227
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,270
Grandpa, please let me get more muscular
faster so that I can become be popular at school.

228
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,780
What's our house rules?

229
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,650
Too much is as bad as too little.
Let's not overreact.

230
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,920
You memorized everything you're
something to say at the ceremony, right?

231
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:57,620
Oh that: Never forget to be respectful and obey. And trust and follow your parents words..

232
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,400
follow and.. what was it again?

233
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,530
Oh, really. It's been how many weeks
and you still can't memorize that!

234
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,310
When we go there and if you still
make a mistake, I'm really going to divorce you.

235
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,830
Are you really going to say this
on your daughter's wedding day?

236
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm just saying its that important.

237
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,740
I know!

238
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,470
Work hard from the time you wake up
to the time you go to sleep.

239
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,710
Never forget to be respectful and
obey, trust and follow your parent's words all day.

240
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,970
Ok, Let's go, let's go!

241
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,010
Recite it one more time.

242
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,980
Gong..

243
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,000
Gong..

244
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,510
Be the best couple.
Carry on the ways of our Ancestors.

245
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,700
Obey all instructions without any protest and let him receive descendants, be respected and not be sick.

246
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,540
I, Shin,
will respectfully accept this position.

247
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,970
I will not forget your orders.

248
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,950
There is going to be a royal ceremony soon.

249
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,040
And this many people are waiting
for the ceremony to start.

250
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,450
There're so many people gathered
in front of the palace!

251
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,360
Yes your Majesty.

252
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,890
It's like the 2002 Worldcup,
a warm opening.

253
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,710
I didn't know that there would be
that much people gathered for this ceremony.

254
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,930
This must all be that there is a lot
of interest in the Crown Prince.

255
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,070
Yes, your Majesty.

256
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,920
That's because there has never been a
Crown Princess selected from the Commoners

257
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,870
in the histories of the Royal family.
So that's why it became like this.

258
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,190
Yes, that's right.

259
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Since the confers of rank and the Ancestors
sayings parts should be over by now,

260
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,410
they're probably starting
the Bride fetching ceremony.

261
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,560
It's really important that the inexperienced
Crown Princess shouldn't make mistakes.

262
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,140
If the Princess makes a mistake then..

263
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,650
The Sang Goon is there to help her out,
so don't worry about it.

264
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,680
That's right.
It'll be like this..

265
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,650
It'll be a chance to let the Public
witness our great traditions..

266
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,250
The wedding ceremony must be completed
without a single mistake at all.

267
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,940
Yes, your Majesty.

268
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,780
The Prince has just arrived here now,
Princess.

269
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,380
The ceremony is about to start so please
go out to the Nowon land, your Majesty.

270
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,170
Please enter..

271
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,520
Come through the west side stairs.

272
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,670
Come closer.

273
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,750
Hey, you see the screen over there, right?
Over there I, no I mean the Princess is our friend.

274
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,980
That's right. She's our friend and
we are really close to her.

275
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,560
These people are saying that
they are the Princess' friends.

276
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,700
And that means we are friends
with Dong Bang Shin Ki.

277
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,230
What?
What is he saying?

278
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,180
So what he's saying is that
we're total liars.

279
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,330
Where's my cellphone?
The picture that I took with Chaegyung?

280
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,680
We're at Eun-young palace right now.

281
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,750
Right now at the Eun-young palace
the ceremony is taking place.

282
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,170
All the public's eyes are
now focusing on the palace.

283
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,640
Expressing their concerns for the
new Crown Princess, Shin Chaegyung.

284
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,280
Lee Sang Goon.

285
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,460
You came, elder Jang.

286
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,630
What are you doing here now?

287
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm watching it from the TV.

288
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,210
The elders are waiting for you
at eun young palace.

289
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,520
Does it make sense that you,
Lee Sang Goon still hasn't come yet?

290
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,260
It's because of those clothes.
They said I had to wear those clothes.

291
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,040
Is it just because of those clothes
that you haven't come yet?

292
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:03,640
And, and I just..

293
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,400
Lee Sang Goon,

294
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,910
haven't you forgotten about the last Crown
Prince that passed away, have you?

295
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:20,060
You have to remember to attend the ceremony
this coming fall with Hye Sang Goon, too.

296
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,030
Let's go now.

297
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:41,850
Crown Prince come up the east side of the stairs.

298
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,200
13hrs a day.
Practiced every single day for a year.

299
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,830
And now the time they can provide is
just a mere 5 minutes

300
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,410
So don't make any mistakes Hyorin.

301
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,240
Are you nervous?

302
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,700
Yes.

303
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,900
It will be okay.

304
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,890
Arrival of the Crown Princess.

305
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,330
What?

306
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:41,570
Crown Prince please bow and
present the ceremonial tribute.

307
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:10,160
Father of Crown Princess. Please present ceremonial speech to the Crown Princess.

308
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:37,570
Show respect and follow the orders,
listen to the elderly.

309
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,660
Mother of Crown Princess. Please present ceremonial speech to the Crown Princess.

310
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,860
Show respect and follow the orders,
listen to the elderly.

311
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:20,070
Show respect and follow the orders,
listen to the elderly.

312
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,250
The Crown Prince is currently freeing the goose.

313
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,730
There are thousands of people waiting outside the palace to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.

314
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,580
Everything is going the way as planned. No mistakes, this is weird.

315
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,980
He must know that we are all watching, thus he is trying his best not to make any mistakes

316
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,210
What is this?!

317
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,220
Oh my god.
Why is there a sudden strip show?!

318
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,330
It's kids like this that cause the most trouble

319
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,410
But I think his figure is better than Yong Joo

320
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:50,910
Please pardon any imperfections in the ceremonies.

321
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,720
This way please.

322
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,900
Crown Prince Lee Shin and Crown Princess Shin Chaegyung

323
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,850
are currently on their way on the parade grounds...

324
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,990
I was quite worried as the time for
formal etiquette lessons was limited

325
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,610
But to my surprise there weren't any mistakes made.
This is so fortunate.

326
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,830
Yes, mama.

327
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,760
You have put in a lot of effort.

328
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,630
Further educate the Crown Princess about etiquette and thus allow her to become an undisputed royal.

329
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,970
Yes, mama.
I will follow your orders.

330
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,320
The King's condition has become stable because of his contentment over the wedding.

331
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll try to assist you all I can..

332
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,400
I will try my best to help mama.

333
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,800
I suppose there will be generation gap

334
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,000
between a growing teenager and me who is living the latter years of my life.

335
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,620
I hope the Queen can help
reduce the gap between us.

336
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,460
I feel emotional today.

337
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:43,790
The people of Goong have to give
their best to the countless citizens.

338
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,210
What do the endless cheers exhibit?

339
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,790
It exhibits a new revolution and also shows a new age has arrived for the royal family.

340
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,820
It also includes the eager expectations and anticipations of the young Crown Princess.

341
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:03,870
Likewise it also exhibits the respect
shown for the entire royal family.

342
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,770
Are you here to join in the enter palace event?

343
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,740
Eh? Oh ya.

344
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,580
But what are you doing here?

345
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,360
I am taking a stroll.

346
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,620
Is the dowager at the dowager residence?

347
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes, she was very anxious about the wedding.

348
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,060
The burden is finally off her shoulders now.

349
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:04,650
Your parents wedding is as if
it just happened yesterday.

350
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:14,950
At that time, your father,
the Crown Prince should supposedly be King.

351
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,690
But time changed everything

352
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:29,870
You look so much like your father and just looking at you reminds me of the sad past.

353
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:13,170
Chaegyung ah!! Look here!

354
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,130
I thought you said she is your friend?

355
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,850
She doesn't even acknowledge her friends?

356
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,750
YA! cheer up!
Let's eat and cheer up all right?

357
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,750
I feel like eating ginseng chicken.

358
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,780
Look at you.
I feel like eating that too.

359
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,500
Everything is sold out.
We have too many customers today. Sorry.

360
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,830
Please move into the centre of the room.

361
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,790
Yes.

362
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,330
I represent all the officials to
send our blessings and congratulations.

363
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,500
Shin Goon! Shin Goon, help!

364
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,490
Now, the Crown Prince is my bro-in-law.

365
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,600
Did u see? Good!

366
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,110
Noisy fellow.

367
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,570
The first lady in the Republic of Korea.

368
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,240
Hello?

369
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,550
Oh, Yanchong's mom?

370
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,630
Thank you.

371
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,100
The new insurance polices will be out.

372
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,990
Oh okay. I will get in touch with you.

373
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,900
Hello?

374
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,690
How are you?

375
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,950
You watched the TV?

376
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,290
Yes, it's is an honor for our family.

377
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,930
Chaegyung's mom? Wait a minute.

378
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,870
I don't want to answer that. I am tired.
Say I am not around.

379
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,390
Answer it, the family is congratulating us.

380
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,530
Congratulate us? Whatever for?

381
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,150
When we are on our wits ends,
they avoided us like the plague.

382
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,280
And now they trying to butter up to us? Save it.

383
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,600
Forgive and forget. This is life.

384
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,740
Don't be so fierce and answer the phone.

385
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,540
Quickly.

386
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:24,400
Hello? How are you?

387
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,390
Insurance?

388
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,090
Based on the age
, I think this kind of insurance is more suitable.

389
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,560
Thank you so much.

390
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,930
What? What did he say?
He wants to buy insurance?

391
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,510
I told him to get it for the
past 3 years and he refused.

392
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,000
But now he says that the whole family is getting it.

393
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,030
This is great!

394
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,930
Again?!

395
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,950
Shin Goon.

396
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,550
What? Shin Goon?

397
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,750
Yes! SHIN Goon!

398
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,330
How can you pretend not to know me and not do anything in that kind of circumstances?

399
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,290
Don't you think it's too much?

400
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,540
Whether is it ceremonial Crown or whatever

401
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,970
I had a 10 kg ceremonial Crown on
and my head felt like cracking.

402
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,040
Using that to hit the Prime Minister, not a bad idea.

403
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,480
It's just a bit shocking.

404
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,100
What kind of person is he?

405
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,450
He can tell me calmly that
he wants a divorce in the future.

406
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,550
He can smile in such a serious wedding ceremony.

407
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,670
It seems that he has a
very atrocious personality.

408
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:05,040
However, he smiled and waved warmly to
the people at the parade grounds.

409
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,380
At times, he appears to be thinking a lot.

410
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,950
I really want to know what kind of person he is.

411
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:21,980
I have no idea what's going to happen in the future but no matter what, we're on the same boat from now on.

412
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Please wake up, Binggungmama.

413
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,260
There are still some unfinished
ceremonial procedures, Jeonha.

414
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,900
The wine table will be brought in shortly.

415
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,690
Please prepare yourself Jeonha.

416
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,900
Binggungmama.

417
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,390
Yah wake up!

418
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,250
Yah! There are still some unfinished
ceremonial procedures...

419
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:56,400
Ajunt, it's too bland.
You should add more salt.

420
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,990
My words of wisdom has been told..

421
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,490
Yah... stop pretending to be asleep!

422
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,400
Yah! Still not getting up?

423
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,360
The Tong Ne ceremony is supposed to be the first night together as husband and wife.

424
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:31,790
But due to the fact that both of you are still underage, the real ceremony will be done after you become adults.

425
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:36,800
So today, after consuming the wine and food prepared, it marks the end of the whole ceremony.

426
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,450
Why does it have to be pushed back?

427
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,270
Eh?

428
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,320
The wedding night.
Why do we have to push it back?

429
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,070
Is he crazy?

430
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,250
Don't look at me that way, rice cake.

431
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,710
What? Rice cake?

432
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,080
Even if you beg me,
I wouldn't be interested in the wedding night

433
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,370
I only asked because I am curious, that's all

434
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,430
Isn't it ridiculous?
Restricting us because of our age?

435
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,270
Is it not?

436
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,560
Well, let's eat.

437
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,630
Let's start with the ceremonial wine.

438
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,910
What? Not eating?

439
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,580
Of course I will eat.

440
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,140
The rice cake.

441
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,660
What is this?

442
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:47,370
The palace maids.
They are supposed to stand guard.

443
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,480
But they are all falling asleep.

444
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,240
I am so tired.
I might as well just sleep right here.

445
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,140
So you are okay with it?

446
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,920
Yah! What are you doing? Get up.

447
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,350
Didn't you hear what she said just now?

448
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:17,060
We sleep in different rooms.
Isn't it this way?

449
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,910
Is it so?

450
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,980
Then I'll get going.

451
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,510
Yah!

452
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,370
What?

453
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,200
How can you just leave me alone?

454
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,740
Then what do you want me to do?

455
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,230
Please guide me along the way.

456
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:51,180
Honestly speaking,
Goong is a very unfamiliar place to me.

457
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,370
But you have lived here all
your life so you won't feel that way.

458
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:05,140
But if you just think that because I am your husband and that I have the responsibility to take care of you.

459
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,000
Then that I can't promise you.

460
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:14,500
Caring about the people around me or putting myself in others shoes, I can't do that either.

461
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,750
Understand?

462
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:22,850
I know it's my flaw. But I can't change it.
It's my personality I was born with.

463
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,550
So what I mean is...

464
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,230
Don't make such a face.
I'm feeling sorry here.

465
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,040
As a friend, I can listen to your hardship if you want.

466
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,570
How about it?

467
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:01,390
Who asked you to back me up?
Don't make me laugh~!

468
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,390
What the heck are you doing?

469
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,150
Friends? What friends?

470
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,210
I only said it out of courtesy.
You petty jerk!

471
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,860
You are really narrow-minded! so so!!

472
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,050
You are really...

473
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,920
Jeoha, please calm down!

474
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,900
Let go!

475
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,370
You tried to kick me the other time
and now you bit me?

476
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,870
You violent woman!

477
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,020
Lalala. I can't hear a thing.

478
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,120
This is weird.
Why can I only hear my voice?

479
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,130
Oh Shin Goon, good-bye.

480
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,010
Let go.

481
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,430
That bad jerk.

482
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,270
Do you think I wanna ask for your help?

483
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:10,040
It's just that for a split second
you looked so handsome.

484
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,010
So I wanted to know you better.

485
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,950
That's why I said what I said.

486
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:20,440
Bad jerk, this is totally disappointing.
