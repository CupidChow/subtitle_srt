Episode 22

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,650
Until this day...

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,420
I've never thought of
the Crown Princess as my sister-in-law.

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,670
I've always had feelings for her…

5
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,770
Yul! Yul!

6
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,260
How dare you!

7
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,170
You're supposed to address
me as the Crown Prince!

8
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,920
What did I tell you?

9
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,530
I told you to address me as the Crown Prince!

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,610
Address me again.

11
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,020
Crown... Prince...

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,040
If you ever call me Yul again,
I'm going to kill you!

13
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,510
It's all right.

14
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,930
Yul Sung Dae Goon, please proceed.

15
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,160
It was supposed to be my arranged marriage.

16
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,240
If my father had not passed away,

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,640
she was supposed to be my wife.

18
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,440
Hwi Sung Dae Goon!

19
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,960
In the past you were promised each other,

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,360
but now,
can't you not see that she is your sister-in-law!

21
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,520
If you're speaking of the hwang-sil laws,

22
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,170
then I have nothing to say.

23
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,380
Getting pushed over for the title of the Crown Prince was not my choice..

24
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,900
just like how my feelings for the Crown Princess is not a choice,

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,310
it's a feeling that I can't control.

26
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,390
Please stop it, Yul.

27
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,580
I'm truly sorry.

28
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,240
I feel like Hwi Sung Dae Goon is just infatuated with the Princess right now.

29
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,630
I'll do my best to make
him understand that it is just that.

30
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,650
This isn't a matter to make him just understand!

31
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,350
Things not going your way..

32
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,960
you said that was fate, right?

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,380
You said that I can forget my feelings,

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,750
because it isn't my fate.

35
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,780
You said it can be thrown away, right?

36
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,350
But if I can follow that fate..

37
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,420
not believing what others say about it..

38
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,350
that isn't my fate, it's my destiny.

39
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,720
Now that I've told you the truth, please allow the Crown Princess to be pardoned.

40
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,220
Take the Crown Princess into her quarters.

41
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,080
What are you getting out of all this?

42
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,070
I told you already.

43
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,390
I'm gonna bring you down with the law.

44
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,850
Listen carefully!

45
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,850
No matter how much you try to step up your way with the law,

46
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,950
the law is there to protect the hwang-sil's!

47
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,650
And if you say that the law is wrong,

48
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,840
it is my right to protect the law, as a hwang-sil!

49
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,260
Then you go ahead and protect the law.

50
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,530
I'm just gonna throw the law out!

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,850
Living life, thinking that you're worth nothing, since you've been thrown out like garbage.

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,260
You'll never know what that feels like.. I'm gonna just start over with life.

53
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,230
Rather than wanting all the time, I want to learn how I should not want..

54
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,880
Even though I wanted something, but I was unable to have it…

55
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,700
But when I realized that I did want something, I had to close myself up.

56
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,840
Chaegyung.. no matter how much I closed my mind and heart from heart, she still came in.

57
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,550
For the first time in my life, I want to have Chaegyung.

58
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,680
No matter how much you want to have her,

59
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,850
she's your sister-in-law right now.

60
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,530
I've never thought of her as my sister-in-law.

61
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,320
LEE YUL!

62
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm telling you this for your own good!

63
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm doing this for my own good, too.

64
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,850
What?

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,400
If I lose Chaegyung now,
then I might lose her forever…

66
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,950
I thought that I was gonna become someone who couldn't want anything,

67
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,190
but now I'm gonna take Chaegyung and keep her by my side no matter what.

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,150
Give Chaegyung up,
and protect your place as the next king.

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,910
I'll just give up wanting the throne.

70
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,650
Do you really think the Palace is just gonna let you go like that?

71
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,220
I'm waiting to see what will happen.

72
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
You came.

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,270
Chaegyung.

74
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,840
Yul Goon.

75
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,850
The king has ordered for you to be pardoned.

76
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,750
Let's go.

77
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,890
I'll take her.

78
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,470
I never asked for your help.

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,680
Yul Goon, can you please take me.

80
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,640
Let's go.

81
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,600
Yul Goon, thanks so much.

82
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,150
Chaegyung.

83
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,960
I told the elders...

84
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,600
Forget it, I'll just tell you next time.

85
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,070
Okay.

86
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,470
If you happen to hear anything...

87
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,430
just please understand me.

88
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,280
What is that supposed to mean?

89
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,150
I'll leave now.

90
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,460
I've never thought of
the Crown Princess as my sister-in-law.

91
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,210
I've always had feelings for her.

92
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:22,750
You know, truthfully,
I knew So-ahn long time ago.

93
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,950
I saw her for the first time at the movies,

94
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,390
I thought my heart would stop.

95
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,420
But, for her to be my wife,

96
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,580
I've become a very happy man.

97
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,770
It seems that everything is going around in a circle.

98
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,970
I wonder if you, my brother, knew about all that has happened.

99
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,240
Why?

100
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,590
Why did you do it? Why?

101
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:25,180
Take me away.. mom, take me away..

102
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,100
Mom..

103
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,630
What is Hwi Sung Goon thinking, making things become a whole fiasco!

104
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,910
What.. having feelings for the Crown Princess, he said!

105
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,820
I said that I will make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

106
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,440
Try not to think too much of it.

107
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,960
This kind of matter isn't going to get solved just like that!

108
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,840
Hwi Sung Goon is just 19 years old right now.

109
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,700
Rather than his mind,
his heart comes first right now,

110
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,890
and instead of Hwi Sung, shouldn't you be worried more about the polls?

111
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,510
I know that Hwi Sung's popularity is high as of now,

112
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,250
but the people out there do not know the real Hwi Sung Dae Goon!

113
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,930
What did you say?

114
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,140
Aren't I right?

115
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,710
He should be able to control his feelings,

116
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,110
and know what is right and wrong.

117
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,180
This is not something that is
going to be taken lightly.

118
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,850
You are his mother, and you may go over this matter with him.

119
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,100
But don't try to think, Pyeha and I would just sit and watch over this. We will also have a say in this!

120
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,170
Park Sang Goon, are you out there?

121
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes, Mama.

122
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,860
Tae-Hu Mama is leaving to her quarters as of now, so make sure to let them know that she is on her way.

123
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,910
I'll take care of it, right away, Mama.

124
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,300
You must be out of your mind, because who in the right mind would do something like this!

125
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,960
I made her bring up the word divorce.

126
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,880
Going to the Han River, was all my idea.

127
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,100
But even though it was all me, Chaegyung wanted to take the blame for everything.

128
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,210
I don't want to hide anymore.

129
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,970
Then you should of just left it as it is!

130
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,360
Are you trying to dig your own grave?!

131
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,340
I'm taking Chaegyung out of here.

132
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,870
I think that everyone in
the hwang-sil should know about this.

133
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,850
What?!

134
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,960
Yul...

135
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,340
We were doing good together.

136
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,850
Just forget her,
and let's go back to the old days, huh?

137
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,130
I can't now.

138
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,840
Who said that anything is impossible?

139
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,950
Just get rid of those feelings.

140
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,570
She makes me smile inside.

141
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,650
Whenever I see her, I may look like an idiot, but my face and my heart smiles as well.

142
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,370
If I give her up right now,
everything will be back to normal.

143
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,030
I don't want to live like that anymore.

144
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,280
Yul.

145
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,150
Aren't you even thinking of me?

146
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,180
Living my life, all for you...
Aren't you even thinking of me?

147
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,550
There isn't any road to go back now.

148
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,390
I came too far.

149
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,160
I am not giving up like this.

150
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,870
I'm not giving hope to my destiny!

151
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,310
You knew that Hwi Sung Dae Goon had those feelings, yet you let everything go?

152
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,910
Was that something you thought was right?!

153
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,170
Pyeha, even if the Prince knew, how could he handle this situation?

154
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,130
You can't try to protect the Prince for his actions!

155
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,850
Please stop it, the two of you.

156
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,930
The person who is hurting the most right now is the Prince, isn't it?

157
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,120
Who would of known that something like this would of happened?

158
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,410
I was so happy to learn that Hwi Sung Dae Goon and Bingung were getting along so great,

159
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
but now I hear that he has feelings for her! How stupid of me..

160
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,760
Grandmother, this is not anyone's fault, and even if someone knew first,

161
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,750
there is no right answer for this situation.

162
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,400
I would like to say something.

163
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,010
You may speak.

164
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,400
This situation is all of Hwi Sung Dae Goon and his feelings only.

165
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,150
I ask that you not involve the Princess in this matter, for she has nothing to do with his feelings toward her.

166
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,530
Having late night meetings outside,

167
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,950
and lying to defend Hwi Sung Dae Goon, how can you ask that I pardon her from this situation?!

168
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:17,800
Can you, Prince, honestly say that the Princess has absolutely no feelings towards Hwi Sung Goon?

169
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,750
Thank goodness! Really, thank goodness!

170
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,310
I must see the Princess,
and find out the truth from her.

171
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:44,090
I do not think that this matter will be let go lightly.

172
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,670
So that's what it was.. to understand him.

173
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,750
Mama, if you are called by the King,

174
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,780
all you have to do is speak the truth.

175
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,550
Do you understand me?

176
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,030
I'll excuse myself.

177
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,560
If the elders ask you about Yul's feelings,

178
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,750
just say that you had no idea about it.

179
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,560
That's the only way for you to handle it.

180
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm not going to lie anymore.

181
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,390
Don't you know how scary the hwang-sil is?

182
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,860
Something like this, is definitely unforgivable.

183
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,690
I know. The hwang-sil thinks that the law is more important than people.

184
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,300
But I don't want to just run away from it, I just want to speak the truth.

185
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,160
What did you say?

186
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,610
If you speak the truth and get kicked out, are you planning to run away with him?

187
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,270
Did you make another plan with Yul?

188
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,590
My heart is always hurting because of you,

189
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,650
but why do you keep bringing up Yul?

190
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,100
I waited, I waited and waited,

191
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,280
even though my legs were going to give out soon, I still believed that you would come.

192
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
No matter how angry you were with me, I thought that you would of came!

193
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,540
Do you want to know why I didn't come?

194
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,590
If you two came up with a
plan on how to bring me down...

195
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,760
telling the elders about your feelings.

196
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,860
Watching you sit and ask for forgiveness there, it'd make me want to puke!

197
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,300
What?!

198
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,100
Even now, with all the scars you left me with...

199
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,160
I still can't forgive you.

200
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,400
Bingung Mama, the king and the other elders have asked to see you right away.

201
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,850
I'm leaving.

202
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,200
Do you really think that you can leave the Palace without my decision?

203
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,240
You're going to live here with me forever.

204
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,040
For all those times you left me,

205
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,370
and for all those scars you gave me.

206
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,500
Did you get a chance to meet with Chaegyung?

207
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,940
They said that she fell asleep.

208
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,950
How tired she must be...

209
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,810
But gosh, the king is really something now!

210
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,950
I mean, yeah, she made a mistake, I mean punish her for her mistake,

211
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,250
but what went on over there, I mean, what if she gets some kind of illness from that afterwards..

212
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,290
I guess we can't see her then.

213
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,210
I was hoping to see that pig.

214
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,780
But there's also another
problem that I just heard of.

215
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,970
What kind of problem?

216
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,310
That Hwi Sung Dae Goon is in love with our little Chaegyung, and this rumor is going around everywhere!

217
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,970
Impossible!

218
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,290
Yeah right!

219
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,530
I'm just getting really worried that our little Chaegyung is gonna get all the blame for that.

220
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
If that really is true,
this is sorta like a manhwa.

221
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,060
In the middle of two handsome Princes' is Cinderella.

222
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,760
Well, I just found this out recently,

223
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,050
but the real person that our little girl was supposed to marry was Hwi Sung Goon.

224
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,050
I mean if you think about it, the promise and all, it's really true.

225
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,080
Yes.. yes, of course, if the Hwi Sung Goon's father had not passed away,

226
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,750
then Hwi Sung Goon would have been the Crown Prince right now.

227
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,040
I think that Hwi Sung Goon's side would have been better for her.

228
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,440
Last time, I saw Hwi Sung Goon with Chaegyung,

229
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,400
and he seemed so caring and understanding.

230
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,210
It looked pretty good.

231
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:31,400
I've heard that he's very popular with all the Palace workers and even with the outside people.

232
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,970
Then, if she married him...

233
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,190
The food is served!

234
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,690
Come and get it!

235
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,310
Please take the seats that you have been assigned to.

236
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,140
Are you okay?

237
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,580
If she'd of gotten married to him, maybe we'd of gotten a gentle, caring, understanding husband for Chaegyung.

238
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,950
Instead of the rude,
mean son-in-law that we got now.

239
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,370
Oh dream on son!

240
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,180
You know that Tae-Hu Mama is really no joke.

241
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,090
Do you think she'll just sit and watch her son be our servant for us!

242
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
No way in hell!

243
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,400
Well the other mother-in-law.. Oh man..

244
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,870
But, I wonder if our little Chaegyung is doing okay.

245
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,120
If you already knew how Hwi Sung Dae Goon felt about you,

246
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,910
the right thing would to do was to not see him anymore.

247
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,000
How dare you stay with him late at night!

248
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,110
What do you have to say for yourself?!

249
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,600
Hwi Sung Dae Goon was just trying to cheer me up.

250
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,230
Someone already with a spouse,

251
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,910
what kind of cheering up were you getting from your brother-in-law?!

252
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,170
Bingung, I would just like to ask you one thing.

253
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,550
Yes, Tae Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

254
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,810
Please answer truthfully.

255
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,010
What are your true feelings?

256
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,390
I do not suppose that you have the same feelings with Hwi Sung Dae Goon..

257
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,060
Stop those tears at once!

258
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,110
I am very sorry, Umma Mama.

259
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,900
For you the Princess, I will give you your punishment when the time comes. As of now, get out from here!

260
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,790
Yes.

261
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,190
Did you call for me, King?

262
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,860
Take a seat.

263
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,300
I've come up with a hard decision for you.

264
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,350
So please listen and understand it carefully.

265
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,320
Please proceed.

266
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,780
Kim Nae Gwan, please step out.

267
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,060
Yes, Pyeha.

268
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,400
This is my first time, to address a matter for this kind of situation.

269
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,920
To think about my past,

270
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,150
I, too have had a situation like this in my early years.

271
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,980
But, no matter how much you try to be with that person until death,

272
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,290
there are a certain few that we cannot have.

273
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,400
No matter how our fates can get twisted, there is such a law that says to let go of all you cannot have.

274
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,390
I have made my decisions by the law,
so whatever I say..

275
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,700
I would like you to remember that it is not only I telling you, but it is the law.

276
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,870
Get rid of the feelings you have toward the Princess,

277
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,400
so that you can follow the hwang-sil law for you to be married.

278
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,630
The only way to do away with this situation is to follow the hwang-sil way of marriage.

279
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,130
I'm very sorry, Pyeha.

280
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,830
But a person's feelings are not like a piece of paper,

281
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,140
so I cannot just fold it and tuck it in somewhere to just let it go away.

282
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,200
Also, with someone already in my heart,

283
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,060
I cannot go and get married to someone.

284
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,080
Hwi Sung Dae Goon!

285
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,070
If the King has nothing further to say,
I will now leave you.

286
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,780
Why is everything getting so twisted up?

287
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,210
What am I supposed to say at a time like this?

288
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,710
No one has ever taught me.

289
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,660
These look good on me, huh?

290
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,850
Don't cry.

291
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,240
Please...

292
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,240
Hwang-sang King,

293
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,330
is there any other way to handle this situation?

294
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,700
From the hwang-sil law,

295
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,700
there was another way to handle this situation with severe punishment.

296
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,880
But with Hwi Sung Goon's case, I felt that we should handle it in this manner.

297
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,790
If the bodies are separated, than the feelings would separate as well.

298
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,960
Spending less time with the Princess will help him to get over his feelings as well.

299
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,350
But, kicking the second-prince-to-be
out of the Palace again,

300
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,180
I just do not see any good in that.

301
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,940
And him wanting to live apart from his mother,

302
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,990
I wonder if there could be any meaning in that.

303
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:52,870
I feel that it is necessary for the situation to be cleared up in this manner,

304
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,390
so that everything can become normal again.

305
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,840
Then with Yul living outside of the Palace,

306
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,100
do you plan to give him an arranged marriage?

307
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,400
The law says that a person is the only way to fill the gap of another person's loss.

308
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,340
As soon as the situation is cleared,

309
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,400
we plan to arrange his marriage as soon as possible.

310
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,820
Then, what's going to happen to Bingung?

311
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,490
She was involved with
some kind of feeling in this situation,

312
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,590
so I will see to it that she sees the outcome of it.

313
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,520
I understand.

314
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,270
Mama, are you just going to stay like this?

315
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,400
This is something that I've already thought would have happened.

316
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,550
But, if you leave the Palace this time,

317
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,950
there is a chance that you
can never come back in again.

318
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,680
Is it really true?!?

319
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,500
Yul Goon is getting kicked out of the Palace?

320
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,900
The decision was made by the law.

321
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,650
He's already been thrown out once.

322
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,800
Having him thrown out again,
does that make any sense to you?

323
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,500
That's just not right!

324
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,010
Yul already knew that this was gonna happen.

325
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,530
This is all my fault.

326
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,980
It's because of me that he's getting in trouble.

327
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,390
What's wrong?

328
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,720
Not getting thrown out with him is upsetting you?

329
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,590
How can you say something like this,
in this kind of situation!

330
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,430
Don't you even feel bad for Yul Goon?

331
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,230
Feel bad?

332
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,190
Whenever I look at him,
my inside gets all twist up.

333
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,100
Then...

334
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,050
why am I allowed to stay in the Palace?

335
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,020
Did you think that you'll get thrown out by something like this?

336
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,420
I told you already.

337
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,640
You're going to live in the Palace forever.

338
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,030
That's the punishment that you have to take.

339
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
You may have walked into the Palace with your free will,

340
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,520
but you aren't getting out of the Palace with your terms.

341
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,550
Then I guess this might be the only chance I get then.

342
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,320
What?

343
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,820
Are you planning to leave with Yul?

344
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,720
Do you want to be remembered as the Princess who ran off with her brother-in-law?!

345
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,830
I really don't care how I'm remembered!
As long as I can get away from this cold Palace!

346
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,180
Pyeha, how could you be so unfair?

347
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,780
After a long harsh time, we finally came home.

348
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,000
What do you mean by Yul has
to get kicked out of Palace?

349
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,910
Without my Yul, how do you want me to live?

350
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,080
Hye Jong Jung,
the decision was made based on the laws.

351
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:51,740
King, think about my feelings and
just please take pity on us.

352
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,230
What's there to be more dreadful about a child being distant from a parent?

353
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:05,870
Pyeha, if you still have sympathy feelings for me, please help me a little.

354
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,910
It's not like I don't know Hye Jong Jung's feelings.

355
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,600
But, that incident,
please don't talk about it anymore.

356
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,340
There will be no changes in the decision.

357
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Tae-Hu Mama, let's talk right now.

358
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,780
Leave.

359
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:18,190
The reason why this incident happened is because of Hwi Sung Dae Goon's actions, so don't feel distressed.

360
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,610
Things in life have a way of helping people pay their dues.

361
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,640
Now Tae-Hu Mama, too, should accept the truth and the precision.

362
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:40,150
Purely white, you say? Isn't it just that you are threatened by my Yul becoming prince?

363
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,220
And did you say the truth and precision?

364
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,940
I don't know what truth and precision is, but for me,

365
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,900
Yul becoming the Prince is the truth and precision.

366
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,340
Since I lost everything, the only thing that's remaining is giving back everything.

367
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,030
Do you think you're the only one who lost everything?

368
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,550
After I got married, I found out...

369
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,180
that the King had another woman in his heart.

370
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,770
The position that Tae-Hu Mama left freely, I had to look at it for 20 years.

371
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,610
Even though I waited and waited, I realized that this could never be my position.

372
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,160
It took me several years to realize.

373
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,960
So what?

374
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,950
Tae-Hu Mama might have lost the Hwang-Hu's position,

375
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,420
but I had to give up the love receiving wife's position.

376
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,760
But, it's already enough getting my position taken away.

377
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,730
You will never take my son's position away.

378
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:57,340
I don't know if Hwang-Hu
couldn't capture the King's heart,

379
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:05,350
but for me, I am definitely going to give my Yul the Prince's position.

380
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,440
Eye to eye and ear to ear is the way to do!
A tooth for a tooth.

381
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,520
They're going to let the princess stay and kick out my Yul.

382
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,610
That can't happen. Of course!
That can never happen!

383
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,040
Kwak Sang Gong.

384
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,460
Yes, Mama.

385
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,290
Right now, call the King's council that I want to see them right now!

386
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,390
Mama, it's not for me to say (presumptuous), but, if the King's Council finds out about this,

387
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,840
Hwi Sung Dae Goon's reputation might be in jeopardy.

388
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,960
Since she is by his side, he will tell everything away.

389
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,350
No matter how many times I look at it, it's so pretty.

390
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,250
Whatever!

391
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,720
-Kang Hyun, put that in there.
-They came again.

392
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,090
They came again. My beauty must be alluring.

393
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,690
Hi!

394
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,310
Don't you guys have to do your graduation project?

395
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,040
Why do you keep on visiting?

396
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,360
Hey. I have something to give you today.

397
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,110
What again!?

398
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,010
This is from Lee In's father's company, it's brand new. You can have it.

399
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,470
Why do I have to have this?

400
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,850
Just have it.

401
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,180
I don't want to.

402
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,410
Don't say that you don't want to.

403
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,500
Ya! What is this! It's so disgusting!!

404
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,840
H..Hey. Ah!

405
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,600
Hey! Number 1 is saved as my number.

406
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,500
It's number 1.

407
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,340
Number 1.

408
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,630
This is what I really wanted to have. Kang Hyun...

409
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,180
can you give this to me?

410
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
Okay.

411
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,840
What?! Ya!

412
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,100
Are you racketeer?
Why are you taking that?!

413
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,380
Don't worry! I will press the number 1 for a million time everyday.

414
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,120
Ya! Are you just a special duck?!

415
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,590
Why do you keep on pushing me away?

416
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,030
What's a special duck?

417
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,320
You know. There's a common point in every drama.

418
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,770
A girl likes a rich and handsome man but he's a jerk.

419
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,480
The girl is average that doesn't have anything, but her personality is good and her appearance is unattractive.

420
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:51,550
But, Kang Hyun has a
good personality and is really pretty.

421
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,190
That's why she's a special duck.

422
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,900
Ka..Kang Hyun!

423
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,400
Where do you think you're going?!

424
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,850
I wish I were Kang Hyun's glasses...

425
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,660
so that I can follow around her bright eyes.

426
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,020
Ya! If you keep this up,
you might get a fatal disease.

427
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,360
I know this because I've been through it, it's a real pain.

428
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,270
Chaegyung.

429
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,690
Is it because of Yul Goon?
That's not your fault.

430
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,200
It's not only because of that.

431
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,930
In the beginning, I thought I could manage living in Palace, but now,

432
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,150
I don't have the strength.

433
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:04,220
These days there were a lot of unexpected happenings, maybe it's because of that.

434
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,680
I've been thinking and I don't think it's anyone's fault.

435
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,480
It's my fault for not being brave.

436
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:19,210
The truth is that I want to run away from the Palace, but I don't have courage to do it.

437
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,890
I think the problem is getting bigger.
So it's hurting everyone.

438
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,080
Do you really want to leave the Palace?

439
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,850
After becoming the Princess,
I don't know who I am.

440
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,250
This is not what I wanted.

441
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,910
I dreamt of becoming free and making my own decisions.

442
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,470
Taking responsibilities on my decisions, that's what I wanted to be.

443
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,430
Probably...since you're like a dandelion.

444
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,050
Me?

445
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,460
Yeah. You can travel anywhere in this world,

446
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:12,150
sit anywhere you want to, and fly away wherever you want like a dandelion.

447
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:21,340
The mind of liking someone is not always accepted is what I learned for the first time.

448
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,970
Maybe knowing these kinds of things is about becoming an adult.

449
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:36,980
If you leave the Palace, I will greet you.

450
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,850
Since it's my friend's decision, I will consent it.

451
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,060
Kang Hyun.

452
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,070
You wish that Kyung Hee did this to you, right?

453
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,280
What do you mean?

454
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,510
Kick out the Princess?!

455
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,250
I'm sorry.

456
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:16,560
I don't know how they knew but they found out about Hwi Sung Dae Goon's and the Princess's relationship,

457
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,600
and after that situation,
they seem to attack the Princess.

458
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:31,850
What can we do? If they provoke, the reporters will find out especially.

459
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,780
I know.
An unexpected problem seems that have occurred.

460
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,350
Okay, so what are the Council's demands?

461
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:52,400
They say that it's unfair to give blame only to Hwi Sung Dae Goon and they want the Princess's.....

462
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,600
to leave the Palace.

463
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:06,990
So they want to kick both of them out of the Palace or keep them both in the Palace.

464
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,420
Yes.

465
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,420
And another thing...

466
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,990
Yes, speak.

467
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,150
If we don't follow the Council's decision,

468
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,880
then they will announce this to the people and bring danger to the royal family.

469
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:35,400
Between the council, I heard that the determination to make Hwi Sung Dae Goon success in life is high,

470
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,200
but who knew that they were going to set foot against our faces?

471
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,300
What do you think about this, King?

472
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,090
It seems like every time we walk a step on a mountain,

473
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,180
more mountaintops are created,
I'm not sure what to do.

474
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,960
Get exiled?

475
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,640
I'm sorry, Bingung Mama.

476
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,310
They misunderstand me, there's no way they're going to leave me like this.

477
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,250
If I become an exiled Crown Princess that means I'm going to get kicked out.

478
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,250
Then...

479
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,090
I'll become an average person, right?

480
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,830
Bingung Mama! What are you thinking?!

481
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,740
Somehow...

482
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,050
this might be the fastest path.

483
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,620
Right now they might be panicking.

484
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,940
Did they think that I was going to accept it?

485
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,140
Tae-Hu Mama, TaeJa Jeonha has arrived.

486
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,850
TaeJa Prince came by himself?

487
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,360
Let him in.

488
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,300
How did the Prince come all the way here?

489
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,190
Sit down.

490
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,500
Because of Hwi Sung Dae Goon's problems, you must be in distress.

491
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,830
It doesn't look like you came here to cheer your aunt.

492
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,930
Then I'll get to the point.

493
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,820
Speak.

494
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,550
Your strategy is much lower than I thought.

495
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:06,120
If it's a real punishment, you should not cause a rift and start a fight over it.

496
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,000
What are you saying, TaeJa?

497
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:15,780
If someone like Tae-Hu Mama throws a rock, you should know that not a frog and a human is going to die.

498
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:23,000
If you want to throw a rock, it would be a better fight if you threw it at the complainer.

499
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,450
In this Palace,
do you think that I have a complaint?

500
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:35,350
You should know that if you already have everything you should leave others alone.

501
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,620
Don't hurt the Princess. She won't hurt you.

502
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,720
Would she really?

503
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,360
When people have a reason, they will act on it.

504
00:47:54,370 --> 00:48:00,870
If you use the Princess one more time, you will definitely have to pay for it.

505
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:08,300
Although you have your respectability, ambition can destroy everything.

506
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,760
And also...

507
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,730
there's a saying that in love, there are tears.

508
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,440
I will leave now.

509
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,920
A man's burden of harsh love,

510
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,170
your love will destroy you.

511
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,920
What are you doing here?

512
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,690
I wanted to meet you.

513
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,000
What's going on?

514
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:17,670
Since you are the leader, if you tell the people, they will trust your word.

515
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,570
Go and tell the truth.

516
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,110
Since it's your personal feeling, it doesn't have anything to do with Chaegyung.

517
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,740
You want me to save the suspect?

518
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,730
Although it's kind of rude,
why do I have to do it?

519
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,270
Lee Yul! Do you have to do this to Chaegyung?

520
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,240
I'm going to follow whatever Chaegyung wants.

521
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:47,970
Chaegyung wants to leave the Palace, so I'm going to help her leave.

522
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:51,230
Whose way? Why Chaegyung?!

523
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,690
If you can stop me, then try to stop me.

524
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:00,020
You had taken a lot of things from me, but I won't let you take everything.

525
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,470
You think you were the only one who lost everything?

526
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,770
I, too, got a lot of things taken away.

527
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,670
After I was 5 years old, with only my reliance I had to become a prince and because of that,

528
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,120
I lost a human trait.

529
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:25,190
Because of the royal laws, I lost my warmth and loving parents and I lost my dream of being free.

530
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,290
The things that you're saying.....
is because you want me to help you?

531
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,250
No.

532
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,300
It seems like you don't know
so I'm trying to teach you.

533
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:43,960
You act like you lost everything in this world, and when I look at it from my perspective looks different.

534
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:54,330
I told you before what to do, but since you're the one dragging out the situation..

535
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,660
Say it so I can understand it!

536
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,010
The reason I'm not saying it with my own mouth, it's my last warning.

537
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,170
Be aware that this is lynched unto our death.

538
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,160
Yes.

539
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,430
You may leave now.

540
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,060
Did you have to do that?

541
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,120
If you were a suspect, wouldn't you do that too?

542
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,070
-I wouldn't have done it that way.
-The result just has to be the same.

543
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,880
When I leave, what are you going to do, Mom?

544
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,620
What do you mean LEAVE? You're not leaving!

545
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,900
I'm the one trying to make you the Crown Prince of this palace.

546
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,660
Mom.

547
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,100
It has already ended.

548
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,580
That's just what you think.

549
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:10,800
Although he wasn't thinking about the exile, he gave his permission, so it's okay.

550
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,630
What are you talking about?

551
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,110
Whether you want to or not, you're going to become the Crown Prince.

552
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,930
Who was the man that you used to love?

553
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,250
It's a past deal.

554
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,050
A past event huh?

555
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,580
What did you say before?

556
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,770
Don't say something so ridiculous!

557
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,520
When I came, I came of my own will.

558
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,260
So, I want to go out of my own free will too.

559
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,390
Nothing's been confirmed.

560
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,390
Don't do anything so rash.

561
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,970
It doesn't matter about the exile.

562
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,480
I just want to live like the old Shin Chaegyung.

563
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,600
Why are you like this?

564
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:24,840
I had first wanted to
live a life next to you as a Princess,

565
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,790
but I think I can only live as Shin Chaegyung.

566
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,300
That's now a situation you can't change.

567
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,280
So, are you happy?

568
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,520
To live a life as Lee Shin instead of Crown Prince?

569
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:52,330
Even so, coming into palace and liking you, are such blessings.

570
00:53:53,140 --> 00:54:00,130
Because if I didn't,
you wouldn't have even looked at me.

571
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,770
Mama, Bingung Mama is here.

572
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,200
Tell her to come in.

573
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,840
Yul Goon, what's wrong?

574
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,580
Sorry.

575
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,530
I just...

576
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,980
wanted to take you out.

577
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,390
I didn't know that you would get exiled like this.

578
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,900
I just wanted to keep you safe.

579
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:28,980
But, because of my greed,
you became like this.

580
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:36,510
I don't know how big the issue of exile is,
but I don't care.

581
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,580
Because I don't want to keep the title of Princess.

582
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:47,710
So, even if someone takes that title away from me, it doesn't matter.

583
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,690
Taken away?

584
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,040
So, is it possible that...?

585
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,980
I'm going to leave the palace.

586
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,520
I was just about to tell you,
but didn't know how.

587
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,110
Since we were talking about the exile, it was easier for me to tell you.

588
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,760
Really, you're going to leave with me?

589
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,290
My decision to leave has nothing to do with you.

590
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,920
From the moment I leave the palace, I'm not going to see you anymore.

591
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,250
To meet such a good friend like you was great.

592
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:39,130
But I can't give you my heart,
yet you keep looking at me.

593
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:52,670
Long time ago, Shin Goon said that the stars have a reason to die, and so do humans.

594
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,700
2.5 million years.

595
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,960
When those 2.5 million years pass, they say that you might even meet the people you know again.

596
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,070
So, we might meet again.

597
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:20,870
Yul Goon, just in case you meet me in 2.5 million years, run away from me.

598
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,330
In case you meet me, don't even pretend to know me and just go away from me.

599
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,540
I'll do that too.

600
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,970
Why do I have to do that?

601
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:39,800
I may be leaving Shin's side right now but...

602
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:46,170
I think in 2.5 million years, I'll still like him.

603
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:54,220
Then, I'll still wait then.

604
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,140
Don't do that.

605
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,600
Why can't I?

606
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:05,150
My heart seems like it's going to burst.

607
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,420
Why can't I do?

608
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,210
Bingung, what did you say?

609
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:41,760
Please send me to exile.

610
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,810
Bingung, do you know what you're saying?

611
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,910
I am sorry.

612
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,440
I don't think I can live in here anymore.

613
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,280
Please give me permission to live outside.

614
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,800
Bingung!

615
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,340
Are you going out with Yul Goon?

616
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,080
No.

617
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,920
He's got nothing to do with this.

618
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:12,630
Pyeha.

619
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,750
I don't want to hear it! Leave now!

620
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,020
Please consent to it.

621
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:23,420
Bingung, it is not the time to bring that up.

622
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:34,630
Bingung, although you may have had a harsh day, you are not supposed to do this.

623
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,010
This is not how you're supposed to handle it.

624
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,900
I don't think I can live as Queen of the palace.

625
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,290
I just want to live as Shin Chaegyung.

626
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,700
Yul...

627
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,350
Yul!

628
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,320
Mom.

629
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,640
I wish you could stop me.

630
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,970
I'm so tired of it.

631
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,200
[Prince. I'm in Yul Goon's room right now. Hurry up and come.]

632
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,980
Shin Chaegyung!

633
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,430
Chaegyung.

634
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,000
[Message deleted]

635
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,610
What happened?

636
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,680
Fire!

637
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,050
Fire!

638
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,660
Fire!

639
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,760
Fire!

640
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,160
Chaegyung...
