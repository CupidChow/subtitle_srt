[InHwa, Year 14]

2
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,640
What is it?

3
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm so frightened I don't dare to tell
you the truth Tae-Hu Mama.

4
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,300
Go on. Please tell me.

5
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,350
It's dizziness caused by
neuroglycopenia Mama.

6
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,520
What... neuroglycopenia?

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,050
Yes, Tae-Hu Mama.

8
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,270
It's the symptom of his brain dying away...

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,010
How could this happen?

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,380
My condolences, Mama.

11
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,010
The 49th Year of Kang Wang..

The ever healthy Emperor, Sung Jo Woo..

13
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,510
suddenly died with no symptoms at all.

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,670
His position was taken over
by Crown Prince, Hyo Ryul.

15
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,940
There were ripples in the
royal family at that time,

16
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,940
which left me scarred and hurt for life.

17
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,250
Now, it's time to prepare for
the future of the royal family.

18
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm talking about the Crown Prince's marriage.

19
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,450
We are the respected Royal family.

20
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,950
We must obey the traditional
rules of the Royal family.

21
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,100
We must make preparations for
the Crown Prince's wedding.

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,120
This is a big matter that concerns
the safety of the Royal family.

23
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
This time, let's turn the danger into a chance.

flourish in the 21st Century.

Episode 1

26
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,930
Wow! So you got this at the Palace?

27
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,030
Yep. Last time at the opening day.

28
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,200
And you get this at the opening day?
Really?

29
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,320
Yep! They were handing this out for free.

30
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,890
Oh, wow!

31
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,180
On that day,
I saw all the high class people.

32
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,480
Oh my gosh!
I should've gone too!!

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,970
Let me see.

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,300
We were looking at it!

35
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,530
Oh! It's gorgeous!

36
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,550
Shin Chaegyung, you can't do this..
it's going to tear!

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,460
Oh no. It ripped.

38
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,320
HEY SHIN CHAEGYUNG!!!

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,460
You're dead!

40
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,420
I am Shin Chaegyung, a senior who is majoring as a designer - a bright, young student!

41
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:17,630
As mentioned before, what prince? You are wondering who these high class people are, right?

42
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:33,150
Just like the 21st century, even today England or Japan has admired Kings that still... What is it?

43
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,450
Oh! That still remains on the throne.

44
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:52,830
Royal families are still being admired by people and are
taking over the throne controlling their country.

45
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,800
But, what is the Korean Palace like?

46
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:09,840
Sadly, the Palace is an empty place now ever since the relation of famillies broke apart.

47
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,190
That is why... let's just imagine it.

48
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,460
In another words, lets just brighten up
our Palace and imagine...

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,330
that there actually lives a
charming prince that every girl is in love with.

50
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,950
So what do you think? Aren't you curious?

[2006 Korea is a Constitutional Monarchy!]

52
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,780
Look at this! Look at this!

53
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,860
This is a picture when the Prince was young.

54
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,210
Oh my...

55
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,550
He is so handsome.

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
He was so cute when he was a baby, too!

57
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,730
Oh~ handsome features, keen looks!

58
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,130
Shut up! You cinderella freaks.

59
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,580
Hi!

60
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,950
Hello!

61
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh~ He's so handsome.

62
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,890
Ding dong! Ding dong!

63
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,860
Hi!

64
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,040
What is this?
You're always wearing this.

65
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,590
Hey, you guys. My hybrid fashion.
Isn't it the bomb?

66
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah right!

67
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,350
Hey, Shin Chaegyung!

68
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,400
Uh?

69
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
Did you finish the assignment?

70
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,300
Huh? Assignment?

71
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,790
Your portrait.

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
It's due today?

73
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,890
OH YEAH! What period is it?
- We're in trouble!

74
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,300
Heh! Why?
You should just keep on admiring the prince.

75
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,950
Hey, Lee Kang Hyun! Why are you like this?
- What's wrong with Cinderella?

76
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,550
Those kind of people need
to cut off their throat.

77
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,300
Eek! Cut off?!

78
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,790
They have no real use and
they waste the publics' tax money.

79
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,680
To sum it up,
they are just things for people to see.

80
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,200
I told you...
not to do this at school.

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,510
But Jeonha, there might be dangerous people among the students in this school.

82
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,790
You can stand guard outside the school gates.

83
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,500
Jeonha, the Queen gave us orders to guard you at school and even inside the palace as well.

84
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,790
We also...

85
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,380
Yes, Jeonha.

86
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,180
Arts, music, dance, theatre, movies.

87
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,000
They are all the things that
can be learned at our school.

88
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:48,910
But, NOOO! I hate the drawing assignment. I like everything, but this assignment is killing me!~

89
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
- Just keep drawing!
- What is that?

90
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,950
Hey! This is good enough.

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,680
Aigoo~~ the prince is visiting,
seeing how loud it is outside.

92
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh my gosh! But is he...
is he looking at us?

93
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,760
He's looking at us, right?

94
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,300
Really? I'll go see! Oh my gosh!

95
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,820
I think I'm going to lose my breath!

96
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,370
Prince! I don't have a boyfriend!

97
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,550
HEY! It's not you, it's me!
Hey, prince charming!

98
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,170
But why are those guys going to
our school instead of the Royal family's?

99
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,330
Oh my! All those born with golden
spoons are gathering over there.

100
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,820
The son of this business owner.

101
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,250
The son of another business owner.

102
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,600
Ha! Even the second son of the owner?

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,150
The group is perfect since
Prince Charming is included.

104
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,680
The perfect alluring group.

105
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:06,250
I despise them. The instant they show up, the academic atmosphere disappears.

106
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,680
PRINCE CHARMING! I'M RIGHT HERE!!

107
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,650
Hey, what's all the commotion
about on the second floor?

108
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,570
I'm pretty!
I'm sexy, right?

109
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,010
Oh! Isn't that Min Hyorin?

110
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
Wow! She's the rare one!

111
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,300
Now I realized that you were
looking at her the whole time!

112

EunJung!

113
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey!

114
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,300
Hey! Here, let's eat the snacks!

115
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,420
Hello.

116
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:19,980
Are you guys seriously not
going to keep in shape? Huh?!

117
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,950
Even if you are awake or asleep,
what do you have to do?

118
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,040
Keep in shape.

119
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,370
Fight! Win! Everything.

120
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,450
The cravings for food.

121
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,680
Come to weigh yourselves.

122
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,300
Teacher!

123
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,550
For every 0.1 kilogram you gain,
you have to practice for an hour.

124
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm so sorry! I'll clean it for you.

125
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh! It's so wet!

126
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,270
Stop it.

127
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,950
I told you to stop it!!!

128
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,980
Throw that out!

129
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,680
HEY! YOU!

130
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,800
Is being the prince everything?!

131
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,100
Am I your slave?!

132
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,010
I am a princess at my house, too!

133
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,870
Oh my gosh!
The prince has never been treated like that!

134
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,790
Chaegyung! You're in big trouble!

135
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,610
You're the first girl who acted against me.

136
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,680
Your ways are kinda cute and alluring.

137
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,890
You...

138
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,920
I like you.

139
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,680
What is up with that guy?!

140
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,780
Just because he's a prince,
he's such a jerk!

141
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,790
It looks like you did something wrong.

142
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,350
Being the only daughter in my family,
I held my anger.

143
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,400
Shin Goon, you!
You better be grateful that you were lucky today!

144
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,580
I got it first! I'm going to put this online!
- I'm going to put it up!

145
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,030
HEY, SHIN CHAEGYUNG!!!!

146
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,300
Building B & C is the place where the people who major in theatre and dance are.

147
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,750
Our people majoring in arts are in building A which has a totally different mood and environment.

148
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,670
Because the Prince majors in theatre, last time, the number of people increased in the building.

149
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,140
Sheesh, how selfish!

150
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,490
Should we get married?

151
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,490
What did you say?

152
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,890
You didn't hear me?

153
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,870
I'm proposing to you now.

154
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,350
Oh! Isn't that Lee Shin, the Prince?

155
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,130
Hey, look. I'm sorry,

156
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,810
but we are still high school students.

157
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,790
But what do you mean by marriage?

158
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,300
You're just joking around, right?

159
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,180
The prince is proposing to that girl right now?

160
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,000
OH MY GOD!
This is definitely big news.

161
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,810
A 19 year old prince dreaming about getting married to a girl in his school. Whoa.

162
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,740
Oh my goodness!
What is all this mess!?

163
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:50,240
OH MY!
She left her room without even space to walk on!

164
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:58,730
Aigooo~! The room is rotting! I'm going insane!

165
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,650
Ah ha~ She left the room all dirty again.

166
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,670
It's always a hide-and-go-seek
game trying to find things in her room.

167
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:16,940
So.. you find this funny?
You.. Shin Chaegyung, you!

168
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,330
Just leave her alone.

169
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,600
You can just tell her when she comes home.

170
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,700
It's a policy for royal families
to get married at an early age.

171
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,940
And in my case, since I'm the prince,

172
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,480
I might have to get married to
a girl that my parents decide

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,590
unless I tell them I have a girl
I want to get married to.

174
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,740
Since we're good friends, it's better to get married than to marry an unknown girl.

175
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,720
I don't want to ruin our friendship
with this kind of stuff.

176
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,500
And of course, the responsibility and dull living.

177
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,210
And as you know,
my dream is to become a world renowned ballet dancer.

178
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,950
I've been doing great,
I don't want to give up now.

179
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,720
If I become a princess,
don't I need to give up all that stuff?

180
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,360
She seems to be a cool girl.

181
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,130
I would do the same thing as the girl.

182
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,500
I mean who would want to
marry that jerk of a prince?

183
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,650
Aww! Look at his sad eyes!

184
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,470
OH NO!

185
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,700
Who's out there?

186
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,790
Stop right there!

187
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
Who are you?

188
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm saying what did you see?

189
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,950
Hey! Turn this way.

190
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,640
Your voice sounds odd.

191
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,670
Did you eavesdrop on our conversation?

192
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,010
What did you hear it up to?

193
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,970
Who said that I heard your conversation?

194
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,680
Did you wish I did? What's to
be proud of being rejected by a girl?

195
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,880
Stop right there! Gym pants! I said stop!

196
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,620
Now, she's even ignoring my phone calls!

197
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,320
Stop it now.

198
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,300
Since when did you care about your children?

199
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,690
Is that why you brought this to
the house cause you care about the children?!

200
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,130
Do you want me to read it for you?

201
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:29,150
Notice of Bad Credit, Penalty Report...
what's this? Detailed Bill of your Credit Card.

202
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:37,750
Do I need to pay for your food after you brought great
danger to this house by lending money to a friend?

203
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,580
Let's divorce.

204
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,300
I can't live like this anymore.
Let's split up officially this time!

205
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey, aren't you sick and tired of saying that?

206
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,930
Always saying to get a divorce!

207
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,400
You little...!

208
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,590
What if the guys confiscate the house?

209
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,790
This is the second time already
and the phone calls are serious, too.

210
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,720
Hello?

211
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,810
Hello, I am from the Palace.

212
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,880
The Palace?

213
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,350
Did you order noodles again?!

214
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,020
You people!

215
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
I told you to settle accounts
in the end of the month before.

216
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Who is it?

217
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,660
Oh, I see!

218
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,300
That's our daughter... and father.

219
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,800
These are the tokens for the promise made between the
recently deceased King Sung Jo and Mr. Shin.

220
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:02,810
OH MY GOSH! This is real..

221
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,660
The royal families are waiting for the engagement ring.
You are holding onto it safely right?

222
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,150
Of course!

223
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,000
Of course we are!
We have it stored in a very a safe place!

224
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
*Where is it?*

225
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,890
Today, we will be focusing on key light.

226
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,530
The key light when used in the kitchen is of hard kilo,

227
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,050
providing strong contrast and thus
is most efficient for dramatic effect.

228
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,790
The marriage will go by the laws like before.

229
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,750
The King chose an intended bride
before he passed away so...

230
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,000
TaeJa just needs to prepare for the ceremony.

231
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,250
Oh! I think I'm going to faint!

232
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,000
I wonder who the girl is that
the Prince is going to get married to.

233
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,370
Hey you guys! Do you want me to tell
you who he's going to get married to?

234
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,580
Marry? Who is the girl?!
She's dead!

235
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,520
That's right!
Who is the girl that's going to get married?

236
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,610
Hey, Shin Chaegyung.
How would you know?

237
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:22,680
Well, the thing is...
anyways, I've seen and heard something about it.

238
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,100
What is it?

239
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,910
Yeah, what is it?

240
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,350
I want to tell too!

241
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,950
Shin Chaegyung!

242
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,950
Hello!

243
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,400
Jeonha, this is your schedule for today.

244
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,390
4PM: at COEX there's a seminar for you to attend.

245
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,750
Once you arrive at the Palace, there is the Western education by the supervisor.

246
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,240
After your afternoon class, there is instruction.

247
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,900
After that you have horse-back riding
lessons which have been organized.

248
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,950
Stop the car.

249
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,400
It may be gossip to you,
but it's serious to me.

250
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,000
What's wrong with you?
I told you I didn't tell anyone.

251
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,850
So that means you did hear something.

252
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,680
Listen carefully.

253
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,700
If you spread rumors that aren't even true,
not only will I be in danger but so will you.

254
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:32,970
What are you doing? Stop taking pictures!

255
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,790
I'll leave first, then you leave a little later.

256
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:55,750
I'm warning you,
you will be in danger if you spread rumors.

257
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:13,180
What the heck? He's a total jerk!

258
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,700
Mama, Hwang-Hu Mama has just arrived.

259
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,230
Is the King doing okay?

260
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,600
Yes.

261
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,180
Why is your expression like
that if he is feeling okay?

262
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:14,480
Pyeha wants me to tell you that
he is feeling okay.

263
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,960
But things are not looking good.

264
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,750
These are some of the important aspects for the
preparation of TaeJa's wedding.

265
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:49,900
The King has already assigned all the manpower.

266
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:56,000
You would just have to cooperate
so as to prevent any errors.

267
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,170
I will do as you suggested.

268
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,390
You feel that this entire wedding
is being forced upon, right?

269
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,730
And why everything has to come down to this?
Am I right?

270
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,350
I can understand why.

271
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:36,750
The wedding is on the way, and there is still no news
of Yul and his mother who went to England?

272
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:48,100
But I think Zhong Jin has some news.

274
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,870
[London]

275
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,010
What is this?

276
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,910
Sleeping here again?

277
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,680
Reading books overnight again?

278
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,390
Shin is getting married.

279
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,560
Eh?

280
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,430
Really?

281
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,750
Yes, it's true.

282
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,300
The wedding is very sudden.

283
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,750
I have no idea but there must be something going on in the palace to have them make such a decision.

284
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:55,550
This is urgent. You go back to Korea first.
I will settle matters here and return as well.

285
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:09,280
It's been 14 years.
It's time to take action.

286
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,510
So, have you decided?

287
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,150
Decide what?

288
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,130
What do you mean?

289
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,530
Getting a wife.

290
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,240
What has that got to do with my decision?

291
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,050
Can't you put that thing down?

292
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,690
What kind of friendship is this
for them to have such a promise?

293
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,000
It's a promise between your
grandfather and his only true friend.

294
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,490
You mean a king can have a true friend?

295
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,960
TaeJa! What kind of attitude are
you showing to your Father?

296
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,350
Yes. Like you say, the role of a
King is lonely and isolated.

297
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,560
So, that is why it is necessary to
have a true friend who understands.

298
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,870
Your grandfather is lucky to have such a friend
and he wanted to repay his friend with a present.

299
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,120
That is why he had the ring and
the token sent to his friend,

300
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,060
along with the letter in your hands.

301
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:49,150
This is funny: "The engagement of the Prince and the Granddaughter of my Royal friend."

302
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,810
And you're saying it's me, right?

303
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,000
To be precise, it isn't.

304
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,650
I'm just saying it wasn't then.

305
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,790
As you know,

306
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:09,700
when the agreement was made, my brother was still alive,

307
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,880
and the grandson next in line for the throne was not you, but Yul.

308
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:27,550
Since the death of my brother, I became king
and now this promise landed up in our hands.

309
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,350
What's important is how you feel.

310
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,100
I won't force you to do things
that you don't want to do.

311
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,600
I am back!

312
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,950
Why is the house in a mess?

313
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,220
What is all this?

314
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,470
Variation of property.

315
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,130
What is this!?

316
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,000
Mom, do you want to have a divorce?

317
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:17,500
Don't. Everytime you think of this,
I get hurt emotionally.

318
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,450
I am very tired and you are heavy.

319
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:30,170
But mom, what is this?
Legal cooperation?

320
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,470
The loansharks are threatening us.
Don't worry.

321
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,500
Mother, when I am successful, I will end all this misery.
There will only be happy days.

322
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,840
Please believe in the eldest daughter!

323
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,100
Then Princess Shin, how are you going to succeed?

324
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,880
Designer.

325
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,480
A world-renowned designer.

326
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,290
Stop talking nonsense.

327
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,880
Okay.

328
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Mom, look here.

329
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:18,730
Can you buy me a sewing machine? Please.

330
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,330
Look at this house.

331
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,930
I am stressed up enough.
Don't stress me further.

332
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:35,750
This is Lee Sun-ae...

333
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,750
Is it here? No, not here.

334
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,690
Dad!

335
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,810
Ah! You scared me!

336
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,030
Looking for friend?

337
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,110
No, looking for a treasure.

338
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,830
I really can't find it.

339
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,350
Why? Did you lose something?

340
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,730
Yes. A ring.

341
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,570
Your grandfather left it to us after
he passed away.

342
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,740
Oh that!

343
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
You mean the one placed over
there when we moved?

344
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,750
Where?

345
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,570
There it is.

346
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,750
Tada! But why are you looking for this...

347
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,190
Yes! This is it! We found it!

348
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,730
Honey!!
We found it!

349
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,170
Yes!

350
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,370
Yeah! Happiness is finally here! Man seh!

351
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,340
This is a picture of the girl
you are going to marry.

352
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,530
For some reason, whether it is fate or coincidence,
she happens to go to your school.

353
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,970
What? She is from my school?

354
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,650
Yes. From the art department.

355
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,650
THIS IS NONSENSE!

356
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,610
Give me the ring, and the token or whatever..

357
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,600
I am going to return everything to them.

358
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,380
Which bus should I take to get to the Palace?

359
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,040
You can't do that, Hwang TaeJaBi Mama.

360
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,750
Yes. That's right.
Do you agree, honey?

361
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,160
I told you to call me an offical.

362
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
What are you all talking about?

363
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,610
I'm throwing this away.

364
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,950
Wait, you can't do that!
Give it to me.

365
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,970
What century are we in for me to
have such old fashioned engagement?!

366
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,950
Mom, Dad, now how old am I?
I'm still a high school student!

367
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,010
Shin Chaegyung,
I will buy you a new sewing machine.

368
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,680
Now is not the time to be discussing
about the sewing machine.

369
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,000
The Crown Prince is going to marry a person like me?
This is ridiculous!

370
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,370
What are you talking about?

371
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,380
Didn't you hear the phone call from the Palace?

372
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:13,990
The Prince is willing to accept this engagement.

373
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,800
I don't want to!
I have no idea why he agreed to this.

374
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,990
He has a beautiful girlfriend.

375
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,590
And I saw him proposing to her.

376
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,340
What? Who?

377
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,000
You mean the Crown Prince?

378
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,510
Propose to whom?

379
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,170
She is from our dance department.

380
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,500
She is from a wealthy family and
she is the only daughter.

381
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,190
She is beautiful and does ballet very well.

382
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,830
That's too much!
Then we'll be so passive.

383
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,190
He must have lost his mind momentarily
after he got rejected by her.

384
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:59,150
He got rejected? Who?
Who got rejected?

385
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,050
Anyways, this engagement is hereby voided.

386
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,060
You people can forget about this.

387
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,950
Hwang-Hu Mama is willing to let you
have your way and lessen the guards.

388
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:42,290
But if the guards were to retreat outside the school gates, it will be an inconvience to them.

389
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,930
You are unwilling to accept the engagement and this is why you are doing this?

390
00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:07,600
If it is truly like this, the days after marriage will prove to be difficult. Please think twice.

391
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,820
Mother doesn't have any other orders?

392
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:20,300
Queen is busy arranging
the engagement and she's also worried that,

393
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,040
Hwang TaeJaBi might not be
easily accepted by the royalties.

394
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,250
You think that way too?

395
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,160
I do not dare to make any
kind of comment, Jeonha.

396
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,870
Don't you think this is funny?

397
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,500
This is the 21st century and
there are still such rules.

398
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,290
But it's okay. I am just feeling bored and even though she is not up to standard,

399
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,460
but she may bring something
refreshing into the Palace.

400
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:07,100
This is the top news. Everything is so tense in the Palace
due to the upcoming marriage of the crown prince.

401
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,450
Really? Who did you hear it from?

402
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,300
My dad works in the palace as a guard.

403
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,010
Oh my god. Then it's true.

404
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,180
Of course, there's something more.

405
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,630
The crown princess-to-be
is someone from our school.

406
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,910
Who is it? Who?

407
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,250
That, I don't know.

408
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:36,690
Oh my god.
Someone from our school? Me?

409
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,510
Okay forget it. Go practice.

410
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,020
What kind of rumor is that?

411
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,170
Are they talking about me?

412
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,550
They say that the crown princess-to-be
is someone from our school.

413
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,400
Didn't we make a promise that our relationship
will be kept a secret until we go to college?

414
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,250
Don't worry.
It's not you.

415
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,350
What?

416
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,620
I just got to know recently too.

417
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,000
But it's not you.

418
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,100
Who?

419
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,800
Those who are royalties and those around royalties

420
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,250
often find themselves in situations whereby nothing makes sense.

421
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,480
This is one of them.

422
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:55,850
Situations like, passing by and overhearing her future husband proposing to another girl.

423
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,740
So it's...

424
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,640
Okay. Since I am going to get married someday,
might as well just get married now.

425
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,360
No. I can't do that. I am still young
and I still have a future to comtemplate.

426
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,850
But.. this is a chance of a lifetime.
Might as well grab hold of it.

427
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,520
No, no, no, no.. get a hold of yourself.
Do not lose your senses. Be logical.

428
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,080
Marry?

429
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,620
Or not to marry?

430
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:55,330
Princess Shin, have you finished preparing
your visit to the queen tomorrow?

431
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,850
Are you crazy?
Why do I have to see her?

432
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,100
But we already have an appointment with her.

433
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,720
I don't care. I never made an appointment.
This has nothing to do with me.

434
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,140
Should I?

435
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,970
You playing with us?

436
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,160
The third most respected woman in Korea,
why are you playing with that broken machine?

437
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,790
What are you talking about?

438
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,250
Number 1 : Her Majesty, Number 2: the Queen,
Number 3: Crown Princess. That's you, the pig.

439
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,800
You! How can you call your sister a pig?

440
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,870
If you get married to the crown prince,
then I will call you "noona".

441
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,130
You think I would get married?

442
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,900
Just get married.

443
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,850
I am sick of climbing down from the attic.

444
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,130
If you get married,
this whole room will be mine.

445
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,020
It's good for you too,
you won't be complaining about me being noisy.

446
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,500
Hey bad luck!
You can forget about it.

447
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,990
If you don't want to then I will. I am much prettier than you are and much better than you.

448
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,870
You wanna die?! Don't you run!

449
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,870
My precious.

450
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,100
Pretty.

451
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,350
I told you people I am not getting married.
Why are you all doing this?

452
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:08,900
Dad's company went bankrupt, that I know.

453
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,500
And because of that,
he has been unemployed for a year.

454
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,250
And mom works hard to support me
with expensive lessons.

455
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:32,420
I know the both of you worked so hard for us but..

456
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,350
But?

457
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,840
But...
will you all be happy to sell me off like this?

458
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,060
Okay.
Let's take it as if nothing ever happened.

459
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,380
Are you crazy?

460
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,050
This is not some threat.

461
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:02,100
Is money everything? Huh?
Is money everything??

462
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,690
Yes. It's everything.

463
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,330
You're still young and don't understand what's important for a woman. It is marriage.

464
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,550
I don't want you to be like me,
living life with so much hardship.

465
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,240
This is all for your own good.
We are not selling you.

466
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,020
It's your life and you make the decisions.
Forget it. Forget it and...

467
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,720
Wow, a sewing machine!

468
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:00,860
It's the latest version.

469
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:13,450
What is this for? It's expensive.

470
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,310
Found it!

471
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:23,250
Why did you get it back for?
Give it to me. I am going to throw it away.

472
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,150
You can't, I already showed it off to my classmates.

473
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,500
What!?

474
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,350
What about me? You got sister a new sewing machine then I want an mp3 player.

475
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,380
I think it's someone from the Palace.

476
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,050
Excuse me.

477
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:22,380
Yobbo, this is all my fault. Trusted the wrong friends and became his guardian for the loan.

478
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,900
Enough.
What's the use of saying this now?

479
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:38,950
Please don't do this. We will repay the money a little by a little. Please! We will repay the money. I promise.

480
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,850
No, not this. Why are you doing this...

481
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,650
If you repaid the money in the first place,
then it wouldn't have come down to this.

482
00:54:52,900 --> 00:55:00,880
The interest is 5 times the amount. How do you expect us to pay? Bunch of gangsters.

483
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:06,980
You are seriously very brave here huh?
So you don't want to live anymore right?

484
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,770
Hey! What are you saying in front of the kids?

485
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:15,410
It's all because of the kids' father
that this happened.

486
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,620
Be careful of what you say.

487
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,600
But that is the truth.

488
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,570
What are you all trying to do?

489
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:18,950
Be careful Chaegyung,
they are a bunch of cruel gangsters.

490
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,900
What? Gangsters? You are craving for a punch?

491
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,490
Kid, you have to be careful when you're alone.

492
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,120
You family of nuts!

493
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Give me the ring.

494
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,900
Princess Shin! Come back here. Your hair is a mess! Where are you going with that hair of yours?

495
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,640
Please sit.

496
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,590
It's okay, please sit.

497
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,980
Thank you.

498
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,090
Please wait here,
Hwang-Hu Mama will arrive shortly.

499
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,440
While you are here I will brief you
on the rules and manners of the Palace.

500
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:14,040
First, do not have eye contact,
do not cut into her conversations.

501
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:20,250
Don't forget. And when you address her,
you must call her Hwang-Hu Mama.

502
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,700
Please be patient, she will arrive shortly.

503
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,670
Yes.

504
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,030
It's OhMiJa Tea.
Please drink it.

505
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,450
Thank you.

506
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,450
OhMiJa?

507
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:13,350
Oh! So pretty.
The colors are like a masterpiece. So pretty.

508
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,660
I know this.

509
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:21,260
Oh my god.

510
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,510
Anyways, I will just sit down and not rustle up anything.

511
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:54,380
Oh no... ohh no...

512
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,150
Hwang-Hu Mama is coming.
