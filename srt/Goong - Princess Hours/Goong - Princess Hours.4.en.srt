1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,650
Episode 4

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,120
Oh, you're still not home yet?

3
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,580
Hello?
Mom, it's me.

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,780
Yes.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,510
I was just buying some food to eat.

6
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,650
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

7
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,400
What?

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,180
TV broadcast?

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,480
Yes, they show the whole live parade via
satellite broadcast all the way over here.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,270
From watching it, I started to feel a bit weird.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,640
Can you understand my feelings?

12
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,690
Hey! I thought that I might have been able to see you on TV, so I didn't even blink my eyes.

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,730
Isn't it like searching a needle
in the vast ocean?

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,770
Did you visit your father's memorial Hall?

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
It must need some repairs.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,310
I have settled everything here.

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,230
I'm leaving for Seoul tomorrow.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,860
Really? Wait..

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,850
What time?

20
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah.

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,480
Wait for just a bit, Yul..

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,960
Let's show to those who abandoned
us that we are alive and fine.

23
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,380
For letting us suffer while
they lived comfortably.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,570
It's time for us to show them the opposite so that they can also spill tears of blood.

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,520
Don't worry Yul..

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,520
Mom will take care of it.

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,740
I miss you.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,870
I miss you, too.

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,240
The Crown Prince's living quarters,
Eastern palace is split into two places.

30
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,900
Originally there was just a
traditional Building "Sa Yang Dang".

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,340
But later, a western structure building was built next to it so, it became two places.

32
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,240
"Sa Yang Dang" is now only used for
the Crown Prince's educations..

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,570
And the new western building is
where the Crown Prince stays.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,340
In between the two places that is a
hall like a big cake in the middle.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,530
One side is for the Crown Prince and
the other side is for the Crown Princess.

36
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,640
I was brought to the Crown Princess
side after the "Tong Ne" ended.

37
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
Hyorin! You...

38
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,370
Come down quickly,
what are you doing in the room!?

39
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,420
What exactly are you thinking of?

40
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,280
Don't you know who these people are?

41
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,690
Come down quickly!

42
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,490
Isn't this your dream?

43
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,740
You're going to their school
for free if you just sign here.

44
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,790
Do you want me to read this to you again?

45
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,490
For the Crown Princess's education..

46
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,250
Before starting on the Four books and Five classics.
Get her to study the Filial piety classic.

47
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,440
She must not be familiar with
the Chinese characters education.

48
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,180
So it'll be better to use Korean to teach
her instead of the Chinese characters.

49
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,110
Yes, Your Majesty. I will listen to your instructions.

50
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,690
Queen..

51
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,270
What were some of the basics of the Prince's education?

52
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,320
The proper way of talking, actions, and ways of
expressing emotions are the main basics to focus.

54
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,580
Of course.
Those kinds of educations are first priority.

55
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,770
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

56
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:43,670
Since you are from a high class family, you were
trained with the ways of the Palace ever since.

57
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,780
So you didn't have much hardships
living in the palace, right?

58
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,480
What?

59
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:00,300
The new Princess is different from you,
she's a lot more unrefined.

61
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:10,000
So please be more understanding
and tolerant while teaching her.

62
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,660
After the accident of Crown Prince Hyo Ryul..

64
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,310
When the King had to suddenly
take over the position during the chaos...

65
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,840
If you haven't helped out with full dedication by his side..

66
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:33,900
The disastrous situation wouldn't be
settled so quickly without you.

67
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,810
I may have not said anything at that time,
but I was truly thankful.

68
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

69
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,450
We are now showing a special on the Crown Prince Lee Shin's wedding parade.

70
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,710
Crowds of people gather on the streets to see the young Crown Prince's wedding parade.

71
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,870
The Crown Prince's wedding parade is still ongoing.

72
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,960
Your Majesty, wake up!

73
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,540
Your Majesty, you must wake up!
Please wake up.

74
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,500
It's morning.

75
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,840
Your Majesty, Nwhy didn't you wear the sleepwear we gave you?

76
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,510
How can I wear that beautiful dress to sleep?

77
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,030
My mom bought me this.

78
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,160
You must hurry to get ready.

79
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,660
What time is it, sister?

80
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,120
What time?

81
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm late!

82
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,830
Where's the washroom?

83
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,220
I'll lead the way, Your Majesty.
Please, follow me.

84
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,370
What are you looking for, Your Majesty?

85
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,600
It's most comfortable to wear sports wear in the house.

86
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,040
Where is it?

87
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,790
The study room?

88
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,620
Wow! Is this gold?

89
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,490
It's fake.

90
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,750
What's this for?

91
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,340
This is really great.

92
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,380
You two are now an official married couple.

93
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,040
The teachings of a woman.
The ways of a married couple..

94
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
The mixing of the Yin and Yang.
Reaching high above to the gods.

95
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,540
Believing in the great righteousness
of heaven and earth.

96
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,310
The political integrity of the human relations..

97
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,410
According to ancient sayings,

98
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,220
honesty is the most precious thing
between man and woman..

99
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,420
The Crown Prince couple,
no matter if it's sadness or happiness,

100
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,140
During your living years,
no matter what time or place,

101
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,910
You must overcome everything together.

102
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,610
Am I being too long-winded for you young people?

103
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:40,050
From today, the Crown Prince's bodyguards
will be reduced to 3 from the 14.

104
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,410
They won't be guarding in school and
will wait outside the school.

105
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,280
And also, as for the Crown Princess...

106
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,420
From now onwards,
you'll also be under the protection of the bodyguards.

107
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,540
Although you might feel inconvenience and uncomfortable..

108
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,890
But still, you'll need to be under the basic protection.

109
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,300
From now onwards,
I hope that you'll enjoy being protected.

110
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,730
Yes, your Highness.

111
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,630
Thanks for sending me the bodyguards.

112
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,740
So, are you going to keep your promise?

113
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,000
Promise?

114
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,870
To move from East Palace to Cheong Duk Palace.

115
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh! That?

116
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,080
Cheong Duk Palace is not finished yet.

117
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,690
You have to wait for one and half year after.

118
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,350
But you promised before that I can
move-in there with her after the wedding.

119
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,870
Prince, how can you be like this?
in front of the Princess?

120
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,240
Anyway, she knows about it, too.
I have already told her everything.

121
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,320
Let's talk about that thing later.

122
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,720
How can you behave so rudely in front of the elders?

123
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,640
What's the difference between
talking about it now or later?

124
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,420
You are not going to keep your promise, right?

125
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,110
What?

126
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,970
Let's go.

127
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,640
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

128
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,840
Excuse us, we have to go now.

129
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,270
I can't believe this!

130
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,960
You mean to say everything is just an act?

131
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,730
I understand that's not an easy thing

132
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,480
to let the Crown Prince leaves the main palace.

133
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,510
So that's why I needed to use
some underhand methods.

134
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,990
Although it's a little childish,

135
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,410
But it's the rebellious stage of my youth. Got it?

136
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,570
What a wicked fellow!

137
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,420
What?

138
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,560
You really told him such things
to just to strike a deal for his marriage?

139
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm really sorry, your Highness.

140
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,480
The well-behaved Crown Prince who obeys
the elders words like the heavens...

141
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,610
I didn't know when he started to
show signs of being rebellious.

142
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,640
I should have just sent him to
the Royal family's high school.

143
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,010
If the King had listened to me at first...

144
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,120
That's really foolish!

145
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,760
The main cause of the problem isn't here.
Don't tell me that you are not aware?

146
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,990
The Crown Prince becomes what he's today because of your stubbornness as well.

147
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,000
He was so well-behaved when he was young.
So why does he now bend on acting his own ways?

148
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,440
It was you who made him believe that he'll be able to get his own way by rebelling recklessly.

149
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,540
They are here to safeguard you.
They are your personal bodyguards.

150
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,440
Wow.

151
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,300
We will do our best to protect you, your Highness.

152
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,480
The three of them are all highly skilled
in Martial arts, your Highness.

153
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,730
But then, although we have already met a few times.

154
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,360
Sir, who are you?

155
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,650
Yes, your Highness.

156
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,610
I haven't introduced myself.

157
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,950
I'm the person in charge of
the Palace's internal Affairs.

158
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,610
I'm like the shadow protector of the Prince,
the Palace Internal Officer.

159
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:54,310
Internal Officer? Eunuch?
What am I to do?

160
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,210
Hey! What are you thinking about now?

161
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,710
Oh, it seems like you mixed up
the Internal Officer with Eunuch.

162
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,740
Your Highness thinks that the men
working Officers are all castrated Eunuchs.

163
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,180
But Internal officers like me are people
who take care of the King and Prince.

164
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,100
And manages the internal affairs of Palace as well.

165
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,720
To put it into modern words,
we are professional housekeepers.

166
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,400
During the Koryo dynasty, this is the highest management level of all Eunuchs.

167
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,600
The Royal family's Internal Officers and the Eunuchs from Koryo dynasty are almost the same.

168
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,720
Oh I see, that's why.

169
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm so sorry to have misunderstood you, Sir.

170
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,670
I'm not a Sir.

171
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,570
Please call me, Palace Internal officer.
Bigungmama.

172
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,500
Bigungmama.

173
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,550
Why do you have a problem with that?

174
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,410
No, it's just awkward, being called a Queen.

175
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,470
I'm the Bigungmama.
Come over and become my servants.

176
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,050
Yes, Bigungmama.

177
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,280
I'm here to say my proper greetings.

178
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm the Choi Sang Gong who's
in charge of your educations.

179
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,860
What?

180
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,140
You're going to educate me again? I'm doomed.

181
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,970
To process the legal documents needed
by the Royal Accountants.

182
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,590
The Officer is now waiting for you.

183
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,180
Royal Accountant?

184
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,440
The Royal Accountants are the officers in charge of

185
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,820
managing the Royal family's personal properties,
your Highness.

186
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,830
If you are tired,
we can push it back till afternoon as well.

187
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,040
Do you want to do that, Your Highness?

188
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
Eh?

189
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,740
There's no need for it.

190
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,530
This is the account book for the things that the Royal family will be transferred to your name.

191
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,040
Savings, gold, stocks and insurance.

192
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,780
Land deeds and properties are
all recorded down in details.

193
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,000
If you have anything to ask,
please say out your doubts.

194
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,630
Please take your time to check it, I'll leave now.

195
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,040
Yes.

196
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,720
Anyway, please take care and goodbye.

197
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,650
Hundred, thousand, ten thousand,

198
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,140
Million, 10 million? 100 million?

199
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,670
Million? Million?

200
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,080
Wow... I'm rich!

201
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,240
You're rich Shin Chaegyung! Hooray!

202
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,210
Hooray!

203
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:19,050
Clothes. Shoes. Perfume.
Digital camera! Handphone!

204
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,690
And all these just need 80,000,000.

205
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,090
- Are you sick?
- What?

206
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,790
- Why?
- You were laughing like a crazy person.

207
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,430
No, I'm not crazy.

208
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,020
Why should I be crazy when
I have so many possessions?

209
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,050
Hey!

210
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,080
It's my gym Pants.

211
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,100
- But who are you?
- Don't you remember?

212
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh, you are the transfer student?

213
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,470
That's right, you are that transfer student.

214
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,730
I thought that it was being confiscated.

215
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,710
But, are you transferred to our class?

216
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,120
News from outer space.

217
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,230
He's exactly my style.

218
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,700
Hello, Children. Everybody, hello..

219
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,590
Hey guys! Hey guys! I got bodyguards!

220
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,290
Okay okay, just wait. I'll transform now.

221
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,620
Alright, first step. Transform!

222
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,250
Success! Success! Success!

223
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,350
Alright! alright!

224
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,930
Ready for second step.
Wearing it, wearing it the pants is coming.

225
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,580
Second transformation success! success!

226
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,020
Are you all terrorists?

227
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,350
You are making me so scared.

228
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,270
I'm going to eat it all.

229
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,770
Want some?

230
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,950
Just eat it yourself.

231
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,160
Are you alright?

232
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,580
Yes I'm fine.

233
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,420
Are you feeling more comfortable
after shaking them off?

234
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,130
This marriage is really not bad.
How did you spend your first night?

235
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,840
Oh my, what are you thinking of?

236
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,210
What? Did anything happen?

237
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,090
There's not even 1% of what you are thinking now.

238
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,600
Now that I think about it I think
there was about 7% of it.

239
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,440
Tell us about it.

240
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,490
Let's go, you guys.

241
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,910
You should have passed the ball to me,
then I'll shoot.

242
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,610
The worst player is the one that speaks the most.
Who's the worst one?

243
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,800
Hyorin!

244
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,440
Let's Go! Why? Where?

245
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,940
Where are we going?

246
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,450
See you later!

247
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,330
I'll feel unhappy if that happens to me as well.

248
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,840
I'll hate her completely and feel bad just looking.

249
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,590
A person that's so ordinary,
suddenly becomes the Crown Princess.

250
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,120
Doesn't seems to make sense, does it?

251
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,790
And it's not some Cinderella story.

252
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,290
From all angles, it just makes people puke.

253
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,740
From now onwards,
I'll just have to make the best of it.

254
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,070
I won't give up like always.

255
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,850
Anyway, thanks.

256
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,430
What's there to thank for?
I didn't do anything at all.

257
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,030
You did, you were here to listen my complaints.

258
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,690
You are really great.

259
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,650
I'm really great.

260
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,290
Sorry.

261
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,910
It's a relief, I found a new good friend. Anyway.

262
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,340
Me too. Anyway.

263
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,040
Min hyorin was a fool.

264
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,330
A fool that only know to practice ballet with her life.

265
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,900
When you look at the competition,
everyone's practicing like a fool.

266
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,270
All of them have no emotions.

267
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,860
I..

268
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:19,480
My life's happiness, sadness, anger
and secrets are all used for dancing.

269
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,040
And so, I'm going to start playing all I want..

270
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,040
You're going to regret it.

271
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,290
You are going to regret your
whole life for not waiting for me. Forever.

272
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,400
It's game over now.

273
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,040
But you'll still play with Hyorin, right?

274
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,640
Don't worry.

275
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Who's going shake your determination?

276
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,300
Don't you know me well?

277
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,340
You are also a fool for not playing.

278
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,880
A complete fool.

279
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
Here she comes.

280
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,640
Brace yourself.

281
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,590
Everything will be okay.

282
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,040
Don't worry.

283
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,790
Thanks for transfering to our class.

284
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,830
Here.

285
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,350
One, two, three!

286
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,870
Fighting!

287
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,080
Hey, we have some words to tell you.

288
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,420
What?

289
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,090
Go stand in front of the teacher's table.

290
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,680
Really? Okay...

291
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,720
Thanks a lot you guys.

292
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,090
You guys are treating me better than what I've expected.

293
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm just thankful that you guys kept my desk and chair.

294
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,740
CUE!

295
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,310
Congratulations Cinderella!

296
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,810
Congratulations your majesty!

297
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,770
Guess which one's the flower!

298
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,020
Congratulations!

299
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,690
Don't be so happy, you're now a married woman!

300
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,290
Your life is over now.
Do you realize that?!

301
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,660
What is this?! It's over already?

302
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,120
Congratulations you clutz.

303
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,370
Hey! Is it right that you're getting married before me?

304
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,020
So, Sam's one of us?

305
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,440
If not then, they'll leave me out.

306
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,130
What? Do you expect me to have a space war?

307
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,590
Hey! What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and blow out your candles!

308
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,050
One, two, three!

309
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,240
Is this fun for you guys?
Is making a fool out of me fun for you guys?

310
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,590
Sam, and all of you guys, you're all dead!

311
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,390
What's wrong with her?

312
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,440
I didn't think you'd be part of the trick too.
You know how shocked I was?

313
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:16,040
What was I supposed to do?
They were begging me to act along with them.

314
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,090
That was my action.

315
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,900
I know too. Action鈥?

316
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,440
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get in!

317
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,610
I'm gonna go now.

318
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,240
When'd you get here?
You came out fast.

319
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
You're leaving now?

320
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,110
That spot's mine..

321
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,140
Do you understand?

322
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,440
That's my spot.

323
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,970
Here, a gift for you.

324
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,340
It's ok.

325
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,240
Just accept it.
All he has is extra cell phones in his house.

326
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,080
We got one too.
It's a new model coming out next month. It's awesome!

327
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Where should we go?
You said you're gonna play from now on.

328
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,970
I have to go and thank
the teacher for all she has done for me..

329
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,970
See you tomorrow.

330
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,090
I think I'm going crazy.
That street is the way to my house.

331
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,690
I used to ride my bike to school.
I wonder if my bike's doing well.

332
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,240
I wonder if the rain got to it and made it rust.

333
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,330
I want to ride my bike now.

334
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,840
Shin Goon!

335
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,690
What are you doing?!

336
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,590
Um.. We're near my house, so can we stop by?

337
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,990
After school, at Suh Yuhn Dang, you will learn about the
21st century's constitutionalism your Highness.

338
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,220
And your Majesty, you will learn about filial duty.

339
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:50,240
I wonder if my Princess is eating well.. wonder if she got a stomach ache, or got into trouble..

340
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,440
It's probably not going to be easy for her
to learn the etiquette in the palace.

341
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,840
Don't worry! You know how clever our daughter is?

342
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,940
Even if she stutters in the beginning, she'll catch on right away and get used to it.

343
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,240
I believe that she'll do fine and I don't worry at all.

344
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,140
If she does do fine, that'd be great..
but.. OH! Should I call her?!

345
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:17,240
HEY! Don't just call her to cry your eyes out!
Just leave her alone.

346
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,210
Hey! Mrs. Lee, aren't you even worried?

347
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,370
At any rate, you were born with a personality like that.

348
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,370
Yeah, you're right!
I am born with a personality like that.

349
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,390
So let's live with more strength!

350
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,980
Here, your phone.

351
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,970
Hello, I'll serve you and your family like it's my own, this is Lee Soon Ae, how may I help you?

352
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,140
You always get to see your mom, dad, and even your grandmother.. that's not fair.

353
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,450
You're mean..

354
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
Conceited..

355
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,210
Con 鈥?cei 鈥?ted.

356
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,570
Conceited! Conceited! Conceited! Conceited! Conceited!~

357
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,780
What?

358
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,490
Nothing..

359
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,400
Anyways, he's really conceited.

360
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,730
Watch out!

361
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,960
Did you fix your phone?

362
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,200
No. It died that day.

363
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,940
Um, if you don't mind, can I choose the ribbon?

364
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,340
Here you go.

365
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
You have a good sense.

366
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,340
But, why didn't you choose a flower bouquet instead?
Isn't it prettier?

367
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,100
I don't like flowers with no roots.

368
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,760
Ma'am, do you want me to make you a flower bouquet?

369
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,640
No, I'd like a flower with roots.

370
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,040
Sure.

371
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,470
Your girlfriend will like it.

372
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,970
How are you my Prince?

373
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,440
Welcome back Your Majesty.

374
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,240
You must be busy but you still
came out for me Mr. Chweh.

375
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,800
Of course, I'm an exclusive reporter.

376
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,690
You went up to become a chief?

377
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,150
Are you using that as an excuse to say that I have aged? That's against the rules.

378
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,640
Oh, so you're Yul!

379
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,840
Yes, this is the Prince.

380
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:59,040
You look just like when you were younger.

381
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,340
This is the chief of the press.
He was your dad's best friend.

382
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,800
Nice to meet you. You're splendid!
We have our Prince right here.

383
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,910
Here, let's drink.

384
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,340
Seoul seems to have changed a lot, don't you think?

385
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,670
It became more stabilized and it artistically changed.

386
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,970
Yes, it's a lot more wonderful than I thought it'd be.

387
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,590
Have we gone too long?

388
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,040
Hey, what if we both look outdated?

389
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,670
Of course, you guys did so well today.

390
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,680
It's because you're such a good teacher.

391
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,730
Thanks.

392
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,080
Oh, I don't have any hands right now,
so I'll take it later.

393
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,890
We're going to go now.

394
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,990
Ok, bye.

395
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,460
Professor.. Thank you..

396
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,440
I'm sorry.

397
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,640
You admit that you're sorry?

398
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:49,440
I'll start from where I left off soon.
You'll give me time to get ready right?

399
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,040
Okay, I trust you.
I'm gonna trust you so hurry up and come back.

400
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,940
Okay. I'll come back very soon.

401
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,240
Your girlfriend is very pretty.

402
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,040
You had your appointment here?

403
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,970
Oh, mom, this is...

404
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,690
Hello, my name is Min Hyorin.

405
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,980
We go to the same school.

406
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,690
Nice to meet you. I'm Suh Hae Young.

407
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,340
Sister?
Oh my gosh, it's me! Joo Young!

408
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,150
Don't you remember me? I was a dance major at our school.

409
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:00,440
What happened?
I thought you died in England.

410
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,310
Oh, glad to see you again.

411
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,080
You haven't changed a bit over 14 years.

412
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,670
No, wait, you got younger!

413
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,030
I'm scared.
Are you a witch with magical powers by any chance?

414
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,630
Oh my, is that your son?

415
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,590
Wow, you've grown so much!

416
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,440
You look like your mom a lot!
You hear that a lot don't you?

417
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,660
You look like a real Prince.

418
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,140
Oh my, what am I saying?
He is the real Prince. My mistake, sorry.

419
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:53,190
Joo Young, I have to get going now. I'll call you later.
And keep it a secret that I came back.

420
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,070
What was that about?

421
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,140
Hae Young unnie is my old school friend from college.

422
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,640
You know, back then,
she was the Crown Princess soon to be Queen.

423
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,040
It was about in the beginning of 1990..

424
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,040
Remember that Prince that died in a car crash?

425
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,690
Yeah.. I think I saw it on the Palace Channel..

426
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,390
Yeah, that's right.

427
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,640
So then,
she and her son left the palace and went to England.

428
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:54,240
If only that Prince didn't die,
Hae Young would be the Queen right now.

429
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,080
And obviously, her son would be the Prince.

430
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,590
Poor them. This is like a storyline from a drama.

431
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,240
The wedding has already ended.
Why aren't there any movements from Hye Jung Goon?

432
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,240
We still don't have any news about her plans..
But according to the Royal relatives,

433
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,350
there's a possibility that she
has secretly returned today..

434
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,360
We still have no proof of anything yet..

435
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:39,640
I've already given orders to start the
investigations from Hwi Sung Mama's side.

436
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,880
I'm so much better now,
but yet you are still worried?

437
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,590
No, your Highness.

438
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,080
I'm already not that worried
since you have become better.

439
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,030
It's because of that child..

440
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,340
That child?

441
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,380
I'm talking about Hwi Sung Goon.

442
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,140
Every time I think about it,
my thoughts get tangled up.

443
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:36,600
Not even a word from them for 14 years. And they
decide to come back when your condition is like this.

444
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:45,370
Not long ago, I've heard that Hye Jung Goon
is also coming back too.

445
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,570
And it makes me feel so uneasy.

446
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:57,340
Is all these, my delusion and solicitude?

447
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,200
Time passed by and grew like the children's height..

448
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,290
How I wish all of these can
just be blown away by the wind.

449
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,240
Your father must scold us for coming so late.

450
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,240
Let's go in and look. The Royal relatives seniors have been waiting for a very long time.

451
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,340
We have to thank them for watching your father's grave for us this whole time while we were gone.

452
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,890
Uncle, I'm sorry for letting you wait so long.

453
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,300
No, it is okay. Take your time.

454
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,440
There is no need to hurry,
so please take your time.

455
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,080
Okay, then.

456
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,590
All this time, we went through a lot, right?

457
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,240
Now is the beginning.

458
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,340
I'm not going to ask for a lot.

459
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,500
I'm just going to get back what we lost.

460
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,260
Not more or less..

461
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,040
Just how much we lost..

462
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,740
Let's not rush this..

463
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,270
A little bit at a time..

464
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,490
Slowly..

465
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,970
You know.. right?

466
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:03,040
Do we have to eat like this every time we eat?

467
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,740
This is the Queen's orders.

468
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,140
To have different utensils for different types of food.

469
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,740
And to report daily about the food and drink conditions.

470
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,430
Oh my..

471
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,440
There's one more.

472
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,740
What is it?

473
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,790
The time to be watching movies
together with Aba Mama.

474
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:29,250
Movie watching? Oh, I like that.

475
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,970
You won't be saying that once
you look at the movies scheduled.

476
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,610
Looks like they are those movies with deep meanings.

477
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,440
I hate those types of movies the most.

478
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,220
There are popular movies too.

479
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,740
Do not worry, your Majesty.

480
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,470
Oh really? That's good.

481
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,390
Then, when does that start?

482
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,990
Starting today.

483
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,190
What? I'm doomed.

484
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,740
I was planning to rest after I eat.

485
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:08,240
Rest? First, it's the old sayings revisions.
And then, it's the movie watching.

486
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,880
The body, hair and skin, all comes from our parents.

487
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,430
Never to hurt nor destroy them,
is the first start of filial piety..

488
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:34,590
You must set good examples to
pass down to the younger generations.

489
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:46,660
To bring glory to your parents as the end of filial piety..

490
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:58,040
Faithfulness to my husband, begins with marriage..

491
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:03,440
Putting him in first place till I die finally.

492
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Mama. The cell phone has to be turned off.

493
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,940
But it's Shin goo- I mean it's the Crown Prince.

494
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,140
Hello.

495
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,440
Regarding the movie appreciation time with ah pa.

496
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,140
I will go over directly after my exercise.

497
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,490
You just go over by yourself as well.
And don't use me as an excuse to be too late.

498
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,770
You mean I need to go over now?

499
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,190
Yes. I will get prepared now.

500
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,490
We cannot allow the king to wait for us.

501
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,770
Hello? Hello??

502
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,390
I am curious about what bigungmama
thinks about the movie?

503
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,420
Me?

504
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,240
Our hanboks are beautiful.

505
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:25,290
I used to think that hanboks only came in a few colors, such as red, yellow and green.

506
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:32,060
However, after staying in the Goong and having to wear it everyday made me realize that that is not true.

507
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,040
We are not the enclosed type of people
that others said we are, right?

508
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,770
I feel that we are the world class people.

509
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,840
The world class people? That sounds interesting..

510
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:45,520
And so?

511
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:53,390
Flowers, maple leaves, trees, sky, fireflies...

512
00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:01,390
They are like the natural scenes of the movies.

513
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,240
Having an additional person really brings out more depth during movie appreciation.

514
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:16,270
Then it is okay to have movie
appreciation once a week?

515
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:23,840
Yes. I will ob.. obey.. orders.

516
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,240
It's okay.
Just reply in the way that you are used to.

517
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:36,850
Yes. I think it's great!

518
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,880
I am not calling as Hyorin today,
but as the secretary of club.

519
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:54,040
We are always missing in the gathering.
The rest are complaining already,

520
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,240
and if all of us are not there,
the gathering will be meaningless.

521
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,240
If this carries on,
then we will have to close down the club.

522
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,670
Says who?

523
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,320
Is it.. Kang In?

524
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:13,770
That punk. Tell him not to cause any trouble.
No such thing will happen.

525
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,240
Hey pig! How are you?

526
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,340
I am exercising.

527
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:01,240
What? You miss me? Shut up.
I am going to ?? You are exaggerating.

528
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:06,740
Chaegyung ah! It's dad.

529
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,910
Chaegyung ah. Are u doing okay?

530
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,740
What time is it already and she is still calling?

531
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,740
She has to wake up early.
Tell her to sleep early.

532
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,770
What?? Really?

533
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,770
You're a millionaire? You are rich?

534
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,500
What does this mean?

535
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,760
What did she get as from the royal family?

536
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,860
Su go yi, hey give everyone a present.

537
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,380
Shin Chaegyung.
I am in the millionaire's club now.

538
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,930
What else?

539
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,830
A club to join when an insurance
agent gets 1 million dollars worth of deals.

540
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,770
My income this year is enough to pay off the debts.

541
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,590
You don't have to worry about the family anymore.

542
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:55,000
So our Princess just has to take good care of herself.

543
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,200
So you have to listen to your elders,
don't get sick and eat on time.

544
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,360
And don't bicker with the Crown Prince.
Don't quarrel with my brother-in-law.

545
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,390
Shin Chaegyung. All those money you have are the citizen taxes so don't feel good about it.

546
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,230
Oh OK! OK! OK!

547
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,880
Why do I feel so empty?

548
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:27,240
Mom became the cinderella of the insurance world.

549
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:32,250
We won't have loansharks coming after us anymore.

550
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,150
Why do I not feel happy after hearing all this?

551
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:41,440
After all I did,
everything I can for all this to happen.

552
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,490
What's wrong now?

553
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,970
Why the feeling of emptiness and loneliness?

554
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,420
What is he doing?

555
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:21,240
A grown up man holding a bear in his hands like a child.

556
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:28,190
His expression is as if he is thinking
about something really saddening.

557
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,190
Is it because he can't marry the person he likes?

558
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,250
So there is a sense of disappointment because of that?

559
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,040
What is this? Then what am I?

560
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,840
This is too depressing and disappointing.

561
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,430
Did you hear?
My parents are coming to the Goong today!

562
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,040
It's time for your lessons.

563
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,750
Petty jerk.

564
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,460
Even though she isn't very good with her studies,
she has a very good brain.

565
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:39,870
Even if we have nothing to eat, she is still able to make kimchi from the cactus.

566
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,520
So what makes her so spunky?

567
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,680
The way she eats.

568
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,730
Bigungmama.
No usage of cellphone during class.

569
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,740
Mom, dad, I am back.

570
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,690
Mom, dad, I missed you so much.

571
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,700
You won't even let me see my parents.

572
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,500
Acting cool is all you can do.

573
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,510
So you have a plan?

574
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,160
We have a detailed plan.
