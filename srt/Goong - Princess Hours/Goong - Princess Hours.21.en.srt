00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,950
Episode 21

2
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,220
Shin Goon, please say anything...
or else... or else I...

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,720
I have to say something.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,210
I love her.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,210
I love her very much.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,150
Yes, with these words we can wash out the rumors
and misunderstandings of the public.

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,050
The angle of where Bingung is seated,

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,200
really makes her look like a pretty face.

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,100
Yes, Grandmother.

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,650
If you put yourself at that angle, I hear that you can look like a movie star!

11
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,650
Yes! She really does look like a movie star!

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,200
But, her clothes make me worried.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,590
I wish she'd have worn more modest clothes.

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,260
I will give warning to that, Mama.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,680
We've come to the end of our show,
and we will commence shortly.

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,070
Thank you for coming out,
Crown Prince and Crown Princess.

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,460
Wait! Wait a sec!

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,650
Yes?

19
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,390
I have something to say...

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,120
Please, go on.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,740
Um... That's...

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,210
We are going to divorce...

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,390
A divorce?

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,360
You see...

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,100
Yes, it's true.

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,810
We once thought of a divorce.

27
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,410
Last night when we were talking, we decided
to leave the matter unattended,

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,100
but Bingung's straightforward personality
let the "cat out of the bag".

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,590
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Yes, we did not have any intentions of
marrying each other.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,530
That means the rumors on the newspaper about
a marriage for political reasons is the truth?

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,010
The term "marriage for political reasons" seems
to be out of place and embarrassing.

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,340
Please excuse me, TaeJa Jeonha.

34
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,520
Our marriage has nothing
to do with fixation or political tactics.

35
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,590
If there was such intention, the economy and all schools'
virtue would be the exaggeration of the Crown Princess.

36
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,640
Then with what scope...

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:02,400
My grandfather and the Crown Princess's
grandfather made our wedding promise.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:11,300
So, your promise, even after hiding it from the nation,
was something you had to keep?

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,990
I'm very eager to know.

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,070
There is a saying, "The Emperor does not lie."

41
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,730
A promise to the whole nation and a promise
to the Emperor are clearly different.

42
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,350
I see. So you had no choice but to oblige
to your grandfathers' wishes.

43
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,260
The order came out of the blue to us,
and we couldn't accept it.

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,960
So we rejected it...

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,120
I see.

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,150
Just as the press suspected..

47
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,660
I went to a girlfriend I had good feelings about
for a long time and I proposed to her.

48
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,380
But in the end, the choice of the marriage...
the choice of the marriage was chosen by us.

49
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,830
There are some things in life
where nothing makes sense.

50
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,840
The change happened in my surrounding
was one of those things.

51
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm thankful for that incident.

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,260
And also,

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,100
to the person who had a harder choice than me,
I am still much thankful.

54
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,850
Please think of this common schoolgirl at least once,

55
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,100
who had to endure Palace life, where she knew no one,

56
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,950
with the difficult conditions of loneliness and homesickness.

57
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,900
She came into the Palace with small, careful steps,

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,850
the middle class Crown Princess,

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,400
the girl who came to be my wife,
who cannot even be severe to a puppy.

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:57,150
Even though she lives with many tears,
I try my best not to make her cry.

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,750
I came to love this girl.

62
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,250
Therefore everyone, please look within yourselves.

63
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,750
Although she's not perfect...

64
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,950
Although she's very naive and young,

65
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,150
she is trying her best to fulfill
the destiny that was given to her.

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,850
The Crown Princess is only... looking for your love.

67
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,180
And the last thing that I would like to say is...

68
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,850
For everyone to please forgive us.

69
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,450
Yes, up until now, we have heard the good
words of the Crown Prince and Princess.

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,550
Thank you for your trouble.

71
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,380
Thank you for your trouble. Yes, Thank you.

72
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,380
In front of the whole nation, how could the Crown Princess
put he word "divorce" on her lips?

73
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,620
I'm so sorry,  Pyeha.

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,240
Um, don't you think she just made a silly mistake?

75
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,090
There's plenty of room for silly mistakes!
This is not what you call a mistake!

76
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,240
She is a part of the Imperial Household to the nation,
and she utters the word "divorce"?

77
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,770
She has disgraced our household to
the ground with her one word.

78
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,580
How can she receive love and respect from the nation with this?

79
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,230
King, can't we fix this?

80
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,700
Do you think this is this a situation that can be fixed?!

81
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,920
He has made a laughing stock of me and our whole household!

82
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,880
Mother, excuse me, I am leaving.

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,610
I feel there will be a wild windstorm
in the Imperial Household.

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,620
Please, Mama. Please do not feel concern
and anxiety to this matter.

85
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,990
Do not feel concern?

86
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,390
Is this an everyday situation we come across?

87
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,740
Here they come!!

88
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,350
I wonder what Shin is thinking right now.

89
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,080
Did he really express how he truly felt?

90
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,660
Or, is it just a false pretense like his smile?

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,790
Shin Goon... About today's incident...

92
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,660
Shut your mouth.

93
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:33,940
TaeJa Jeonha, the King has just issued an order to cancel
all your events today and head directly to the Palace.

94
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,740
TaeJa, did you expect this to occur?

95
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,720
I trusted you and believed
you would handle this live interview well.

96
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,610
How could you cause such an accident?

97
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm sorry, Pyeha.

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,820
I am asking the Prince.

99
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,130
Bingung, how could you say such a thing?

100
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,620
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,700
In the history of the Imperial Household, this is probably
the first time the word "divorce" has come up.

102
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,200
What in the world happened between you two?

103
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,190
What could have made you say the word divorce?

104
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,520
I just... made a mistake.
I don't even know why I did such a thing.

105
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,150
I don't know what would have happened if
the Crown Prince hadn't helped me out, Pyeha.

106
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,300
You dare to be near him?

107
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,950
Why haven't you said a word, Prince?

108
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,970
If you're looking for someone to blame this whole incident on,

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,100
just as you heard this girl who is not suited to the Palace say,

110
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,280
I also believe it none of the adults' fault.

111
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,380
What did you say?

112
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
TaeJa!

113
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,780
Give strong punishment to the unqualified Crown Princess

114
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,850
and re-educate her

115
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,300
because she could not get the rules of the Palace yet.

116
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,660
Are you disobeying me?!

117
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,830
I see no remorse or apology in your words.

118
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,200
Are you going to take responsibility for
the Imperial Household of your actions?

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,120
We have done nothing wrong,
so we need not apologize.

120
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,310
We will be confined in our quarters for now.

121
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,370
Why did you say that?
Now the situation is more difficult.

122
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,790
If I didn't talk that way,
we would have probably had to beg for forgiveness.

123
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,950
But still, when an adult is angry, isn't it definite
that we should at least ask for forgiveness?

124
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,850
Then I think you should apologize to me first.

125
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,440
What?

126
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:27,310
Ever since I was born,
I've never asked for an earnest request.

127
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,420
I've never been in such a pitiable situation,
and I've never felt so miserable.

128
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,340
I explicitly asked of you,
please, just bear with me for today.

129
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,600
I'll finish it when it should be.

130
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,710
Shin Goon...

131
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,230
I believed in you with all my heart.

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:59,100
In the end, you opened your loose and
stupid mouth and crushed my request.

133
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,830
I don't know what's what anymore.

134
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,360
But, you know, I was also serious then.

135
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,950
If I could grow up in the Palace until the end,

136
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,900
If you would like me until the end, that's why I did it.

137
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,030
I didn't know that the divorce..
my fight against the Palace's jurisdiction

138
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,900
was something I could say in one moment, something
that would be stupid, to do when I spoke of a divorce.

139
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,530
You...

140
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,850
You don't care about my heart.

141
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,230
The things you said at the interview,
I couldn't tell if they were true.

142
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,320
Because it's an interview.
And also, and also you...

143
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,820
Those words were from my heart.

144
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,360
For the first time in my life,
I said those words with meaning.

145
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:06,590
You stepped on my first confession not as
a Crown Prince, but as a man to a woman.

146
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,770
I never meant to...

147
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,500
I don't know since when,
but we both came along the same path.

148
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,590
Just as you shook me,
you brought my heart out of my hidden cave...

149
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,440
Just like my heart was broken,
I became more and more curious of you.

150
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:37,380
I wanted to see you,
and with the mere thought of you, I smiled silly.

151
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,350
You made me into a fool.

152
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,340
After you make me into a fool, you bring up divorce?

153
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:58,200
The person who stole my heart is not me,
but know clearly that it's you.

154
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,040
She made a mistake because
she is at such a young age.

155
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,920
Please forgive them.

156
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,330
Didn't you see the Prince's rudeness?

157
00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:01,530
With this kind of Prince, how am I to hand over
the throne and see him rule in the future?

158
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,530
During the interview, I saw he was deeply
hurt by the Crown Princess's words.

159
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,410
I see doubt in the Prince's temperament.

160
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,270
Look at Yul, he takes responsibility for his actions
and guarded the Imperial Household.

161
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,320
Is this because of your lingering attachment to his mother?

162
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,210
Is that why you want to give the throne to Yul?

163
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,390
Queen!

164
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,510
You should not be doing this.

165
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,840
If you're having second thoughts about the throne,

166
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,730
I will always stay by the Prince and protect him.

167
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,070
Why do you think Chaegyung said such a thing?

168
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,590
You're probably right. The Palace is
probably raging about this right now!

169
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:56,160
So are you saying the pig has another boyfriend, or
is it because of Shin that she wants to get a divorce?

170
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,780
What should we do? I'm worried about this situation.

171
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,930
Ever since she visited us from the Palace,
her face did not look good!

172
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,570
Dear, let's bring our Chaegyung back!
I'm worried that she's going to starve to death!

173
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,260
Mom, I'm also worried about the pig!
Let's raise the pig at our house!

174
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,940
You little!

175
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,930
Hold on.

176
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,280
Should we call them?

177
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,870
No,

178
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:32,150
if we call, Chaegyung might be put in a more difficult position.

179
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,150
Oh no, dear.

180
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,450
Why?

181
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,740
Huh?

182
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,150
What is it?

183
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,080
An exiled Queen.
What if our Chaegyung becomes an exiled Queen?

184
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,250
Then at the Palace, the pig will....

185
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,470
Why are they filming that stupid thing all day?

186
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,420
Yeah... Kang Hyun!

187
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,320
You don't think Chaegyung will become an
exiled Queen after this, do you?

188
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,130
I don't have a good feeling about this.

189
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,500
To add on, if the truth becomes clear that
the Crown Prince is not of age...

190
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,970
I don't even want to think about it!

191
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,810
Chaegyung's probably going through a hard time...

192
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,320
Hey! What the heck Lee-In!

193
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,060
I can't do this! She's too funny!
Please change her!

194
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,520
Hey Hyu-in! Stop squealing and do it well!

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,280
Because Shin's late, everything's delayed!

196
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,000
Hey! Again again! From the top!

197
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,620
Hey... take the camera.

198
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,040
Beautiful swan,
do you not want to be my subject of shooting?

199
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,490
Ugh! I'm going to throw up!

200
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,400
We have made sure that the people who stole
the car will not speak of the incident.

201
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,550
Alright, but the problem is within the Palace.

202
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,130
Because the Bingung brought up the possibility of a divorce,

203
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,930
they will be looking for the man she was with.

204
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,570
Our Yul is in danger.

205
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,800
Tae-Hu Mama, I am very sorry to mention this.

206
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,080
If the King forgives Bingung peacefully...

207
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,960
No one in the Palace will take this issue extensively.

208
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Alright. Using that boy is one way of solving this problem.

209
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,220
Shin Goon... I'm sorry.

210
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,490
You said you loved me.

211
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,260
If it was true, if it's true...

212
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,160
Can't you just understand me?

213
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,940
Can't it be solved with my apology?

214
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,680
I didn't know it would turn out this way.

215
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,280
After I entered the Palace, I smiled like I was happy.

216
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,830
But the truth is, I'm worried and scared.

217
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,580
I just tried not to show my true feelings.

218
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,900
Even though I wore pretty clothes, I always felt
I was wearing someone else's clothes.

219
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,940
These clothes of a crown Princess,
they're too heavy now.

220
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,390
So... I just wanted to run away.

221
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,920
I was only thinking of myself so
I didn't even think of Shin Goon getting hurt.

222
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry.

223
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,140
Something is wrong with
the Bingung bringing up divorce all of a sudden.

224
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:38,650
I feel there must be a good reason.
Do you think she is telling the truth?

225
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,520
The people who stole her car could have lied too.

226
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,230
I do not feel that the Bingung would have lied about this.

227
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,650
Pyeha, do you love me?

228
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:16,900
When the crown Prince professed
his love today at the interview, I felt numb.

229
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,000
Maybe it was because
the Bingung brought up the topic of a divorce,

230
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:37,210
but more than that shock, the love hidden deep
within the Prince brought out my feelings.

231
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,010
And I was jealous of Bingung.

232
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:53,070
I thought of all the wives in
the world who had the love of their husbands.

233
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:02,740
They're able to solve all their troubles and obstacles.

234
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,840
Park Sang Gong, you may leave.

235
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,330
Yes, Mama.

236
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,620
Have a seat, Bingung.

237
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,490
Yes.

238
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:59,390
Because you brought up the subject of a divorce,
the scandal is only growing bigger.

239
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,330
I'm sorry.

240
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,290
I want to check one thing with you.

241
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:21,780
I'm guessing Yul's feelings,
but what I'm curious of is your feelings for him.

242
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,990
Feelings?

243
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,320
There is no such thing as
friendship between a man and a woman.

244
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,200
All I am asking is your true feelings for Yul Sung Dae Goon.

245
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,660
I've never felt anything more than a friendship towards him.

246
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,820
Can I trust your words?

247
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,410
Yes, Hwang-Hu Mama.

248
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,390
Bingung Mama, Tae-Hu Mama would wish to see you.

249
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,700
Tae-Hu Mama?

250
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,920
Mama, Bingung Mama is here.

251
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,970
Please allow her in.

252
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,040
Welcome, Bingung. Please sit.

253
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,820
Yes, Tae-Hu Mama.

254
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,080
You're having a hard time, no?

255
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,990
It's only because I've done wrong.

256
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,110
What could a young Bingung have done wrong.

257
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,380
Everyone makes mistakes.

258
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,040
Alright. What do you suppose you are going to do?

259
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,780
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

260
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,310
The Imperial Household, as well as the King's pride
has been lost in this conclusion,

261
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,370
so it's not going to be easy to gain forgiveness.

262
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,790
What should I do for them to forgive me?

263
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,510
Do you really want forgiveness?

264
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,750
Yes.

265
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,090
In my opinion, I think you need an extreme solution.

266
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,630
What's that mean?

267
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,530
Do you know Sukgodaejwe (Waiting on a straw mat until a punishment is given)?

268
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:19,880
Although the King is very angry,
he might falter if you do Sukgodaejwe.

269
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,680
King, because you're in a bad disposition,
I'm worried for your health.

270
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,350
I'm worried for the Imperial Household.

271
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
During these times, I must go to the event.

272
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,020
Pyeha, the Prince has just arrived.

273
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,840
Allow him to come in.

274
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,980
TaeJa, you can go back.

275
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,140
Pyeha!

276
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,740
Pyeha.

277
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,660
The museum's event holds a
great position in foreign countries' cultures,

278
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,900
and shows the Imperial Household's trust towards them,

279
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,660
and this is an official ceremony for the Imperial
Household! The Prince must attend.

280
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,080
That is the exact reason why I wish to leave the Prince here!

281
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,410
Pyeha! How could you say such a thing!

282
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:17,100
Today's function shows all of
Korea's ambassadors our culture.

283
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:23,120
Therefore, I will bring Yul, who seems to be
more informed of Korea's formalities.

284
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,390
If you feel that way, I shall stay.

285
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,520
Prince! What kind of behavior is that?

286
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:40,160
Your job is to follow in the King's footsteps,
so the nation can take a brighter road to the future.

287
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,790
Pyeha, Yul Sung Dae Goon Mama has just arrived.

288
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,680
Allow him in.

289
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,680
I see that the Crown Prince is here too.

290
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,630
I heard that you will be participating in today's event.

291
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,630
I'm only participating for the nation.

292
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,500
Pyeha, before we leave. I must address a problem to you.

293
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,960
Tell me.

294
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,930
There's a man that works for the government, Jo Sung Kwang, who is rebelling and is causing trouble right now.

295
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,690
Really? Isn't that a problem worthy of addressing?

296
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,750
Then, I will take that as a consent and I will propose it.

297
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:49,410
For today's event, he has stayed up all night investigating
documents and worrying about the cultural influence.

298
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,800
Yes. I feel confident with your presence, Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

299
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,000
It's nothing.

300
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,170
We must depart now, Pyeha.

301
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:33,480
Pyeha, please forgive me.
Everything was my mistake.

302
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,480
Your actions will not pick up the already spilt water.

303
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,970
Choi Sang Gong, bring Bingung back to her place.

304
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,070
Pyeha, everything is my fault. Please forgive me!

305
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,920
Then I will ask one thing of you.

306
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,050
Is the reason for your bringing up the matter of the divorce

307
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,450
because of the man
that is being spoken about in the papers?

308
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,030
Why can't you answer?
I will ask you one more thing.

309
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,500
Are you sure that the guy you were with is your dad?

310
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,700
That's...

311
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,200
Dae Goon, let's pick up our pace.

312
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,150
Just get up.

313
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,550
He's not the type of person who will give in to something like this.

314
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,550
Your actions alone will not get him to forgive you.
Don't even attempt it.

315
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,400
But still, if I apologize genuinely,
he will forgive me.

316
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,150
Do you still not get it!?

317
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,050
Your honesty will not get you anywhere in this situation.

318
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,180
So stop being stubborn.

319
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,850
Don't mind me!
I'm going to settle this.

320
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,770
Then do as you please.

321
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,250
Pyeha, how are you?

322
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,750
Yes, it's you, Hwi Sung Goon.

323
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,810
Is Bingung still waiting?

324
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,650
Yes.

325
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,470
This place has been taken care of carefully.

326
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,970
Alright.

327
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,590
Gong Nae Gwan.

328
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,200
Yes, Jeonha.

329
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,920
What kind of place was this originally?

330
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,790
This place was originally a library that kept all
the official documents of the Palace,

331
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,270
but after everything was moved,
it was used as a storage.

332
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:19,300
In this place,
I found the King and Tae-Hu Mama's letter of affection.

333
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:28,070
Since you have known each them for a long time,
you probably know this too?

334
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:37,400
Is the letter I saw happened to be... true?

335
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:45,150
Then this place, was a place to anticipate coming to.

336
00:37:50,640 --> 00:38:02,430
Now I understand why the King is
so kind to Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

337
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,350
Jeonha...

338
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:10,410
Do you think I can bear this bias?

339
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,960
I am the assistant who apotheosizes the sky
that is able to hold away cruelty.

340
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,400
You are the deepest and the highest sky.

341
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,990
Mama!!

342
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,940
Bingung Mama!

343
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:39,160
These artifact, donated by a Japanese,
represent the Age of Shilla.

344
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,570
I think all three of these,

345
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,320
I think all of these are the same.

346
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,690
You've noticed it very well, Dae Goon Mama.

347
00:39:46,690 --> 00:40:00,540
These artifacts were made in 7 B.C., by the Baek
Jae people, and they have been found now.

348
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:11,020
As you have all seen now,
this is a skill we can all learn in school.

349
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,630
Some people may wonder why
we are exhibiting these artifacts now,

350
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,300
and the reason is to show that these artifacts
are a pride to the Korean heritage.

351
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,700
Hello, Yoo-Mo. It's me.

352
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,200
How is Chaegyung doing?

353
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,390
I see. Okay.

354
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,860
Dae Goon Mama, the King is asking for you.

355
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:32,740
Doing such a harsh mistake,
and asking for the King's forgiveness is right.

356
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:38,210
But you have just made a mistake,
and it is all just a misunderstanding.

357
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,300
This is not such a manner
to be asking for such forgiveness, Princess.

358
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,030
I'm very sorry, Tae Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

359
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:50,060
Please get up.
Something terrible may happen to you.

360
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,290
From my mistake, I will like to be forgiven,
Tae Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

361
00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:00,180
The king is just getting a misunderstanding about who
you were with that night. Just tell him the truth.

362
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:09,900
The only way to get over this misunderstanding,
is by telling the truth.

363
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,150
I'm very sorry I cannot say,
Tae-Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

364
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:29,160
I've always treated you with kindness, there probably
is something that you are trying to hide from me.

365
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,600
Pyeha, I have something I have to say.

366
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,980
Tell me what it is you have to say.

367
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,490
They say that Bingung Mama is
still asking for your forgiveness.

368
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:15,450
Pyeha, won't you please show her your mercy.

369
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:21,150
She is such a weak girl, and doing this act
for your forgiveness is just too harsh.

370
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,390
This is not a matter of yours, Dae Goon.

371
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,400
Bingung.

372
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,020
Where is the Prince?

373
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:05,030
I'm truly sorry.
Please forgive us.

374
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,750
Stop making me look like a bad father-in-law,
and go back into your quarters.

375
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,520
Just by you doing this,
does not make your wrong doing go away.

376
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,180
Pyeha.

377
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:26,480
Can you not act more kindly towards the Prince?

378
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:32,650
TaeJa Jeonha doesn't even want to use
the pen that you had gotten him,

379
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:44,150
since he feels that it is special, he just leaves it in a pen
holder and look at it, even though he does not say,

380
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:56,060
or act like it, he is scared of you, and misses you,
and he is loving you in his own way...

381
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,280
Bingung.

382
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,180
Bingung, do you think that I dislike the Prince?

383
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:19,080
In this world,
there is no parent who hates his own child.

384
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:29,350
However, the mistakes that their child makes,
the father is responsible for.

385
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,050
Go and get Chaegyung!

386
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,990
Do you even know how she's doing?

387
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,870
Did you even go to see how she's doing?
She's going to end up fainting by that!

388
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:23,120
Stop trying to show off!
You don't have to worry about it!

389
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,640
This is the kind of person you are.

390
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,030
If you were more of a warmer person,
I might of just left Chaegyung to you.

391
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:43,740
But, you, being such a self absorbed, uncaring person,
I can't send Chaegyung to you!

392
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:51,750
This is reality! There is something that
says the law is greater than will.

393
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,270
The law! Your defense is always the Hwang Sil law!

394
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,830
Because of that great law of yours,
I had everything taken away from me!

395
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,480
If you're so upset by the law, that must mean
that you have a plan to change it.

396
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,820
That's what I'm going to do. From now on,
I'm going to break the laws!

397
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,410
What?

398
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,620
I don't know what you're thinking of,

399
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,700
loving your sister in law in that dirty way,
is something that should only done once!

400
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,260
Stop spreading your dirtiness into this Palace.

401
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,830
Stop trying to put me down.

402
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:34,130
If you try to put down my love again,
then I'll never forgive you.

403
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,000
Chaegyung, let's stop this.

404
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:09,120
I'm sorry.. I'm sorry.

405
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,470
Why are you?

406
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:18,550
I'm the one who told you to say it.
I'm the one. It's all my fault.

407
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:27,500
It's not because you made me do it.
It's probably because I wanted to say it myself.

408
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:43,620
It's honey with water.
At least drink this. You look so tired.

409
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,420
What about Shin? Did you go see Shin?

410
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,600
Shin, that jerk,
he doesn't even seem to care that your like this!

411
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,760
So stop waiting for him.

412
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,900
I really don't think that this is the right way for you.

413
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,980
I'm sorry to have put you through this.

414
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:56,210
Pyeha, are you just going to let the Princess stay like that?

415
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,970
She may end up with a disease like that, Pyeha.

416
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:13,410
Hwang-Hu, why do you think the Princess had brought
up the words divorce in the interview?

417
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:19,580
That is the Prince had explained it...

418
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,200
Do you, Hwang-Hu, see me as an idiot!

419
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:29,010
Pyeha, how can you say such a thing?
I certainly do not think that way, Pyeha.

420
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,920
The Princess has been like that since morning, yet they
tell me that the Prince has not once gone to see her.

421
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,280
Why do you think that is so?

422
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,310
I want you to find out who was with the Princess that night. This is not a matter to just look over.

423
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,330
You can ask the King as a favor!

424
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,450
Who is the one looking out for who right now!?

425
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,480
Because of that stupid Princess, your problem
is starting to look like a big deal!

426
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,150
Now that the King is looking for that guy she was with,

427
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:12,250
the scandal will just lead up to you,
and it's only a matter of time!

428
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,250
The pardon act was it you who made her do it?

429
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,290
It was impossible not to.
I didn't want you to be involved in it.

430
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:27,550
Yoo-mo, as life goes on, they say that you cannot
get your children to live the way you want it,

431
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,280
I think those words were right.

432
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,080
Mama, what is it that you are trying to say?

433
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:41,250
To my Yul, I thought I was the only one in his life.

434
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,920
Is this what you call a new lifetime?
My son is saying that he is in love.

435
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,690
Yet, he is saying that he is in love with the Crown Princess.

436
00:53:54,740 --> 00:54:02,270
There will be a time, soon enough,
when you can live worry free, Mama.

437
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,330
Do you really think so?

438
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:10,740
A love he has found so strongly
do you think he can just let it go?

439
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,640
That coincidence, is just too much of a coincidence.

440
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,270
Jeonha, you've been looking at the same page for hours.

441
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,950
This story line is very interesting.

442
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:01,790
Jeonha, are you going to just leave the Princess like that?

443
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,690
Now is the time to go get her out from there.

444
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,190
Jeonha.

445
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,290
You've finished all your work. Then just go.

446
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,900
Bingung Mama.
Mama, it is time for you to go!

447
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,980
If you stay any longer like this, there is a chance
of you catching a fatal disease!

448
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:54,900
Mama, please think about what you are doing.

449
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,180
Mama, please stop this at once.

450
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,630
You must get up.

451
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,150
I'm so tired.

452
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:19,010
Before I get forgiven,
I'm not going to move, not even a step.

453
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,360
I'm really tired,
so please stop making me talk now.

454
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,110
Bingung is still there as we speak?!

455
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,460
Bingung Mama can't stay like that any longer.

456
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,600
She hasn't even drank a sip of water since yesterday.

457
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,700
I feel that I've have lived too long for this.

458
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,600
Mama, how can you say such a thing!

459
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,420
I've lived too long a life for this!

460
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,820
That is why I'm being punished by
witnessing all this dreadful things!

461
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,260
Halma Mama, please help Bingung.

462
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,780
Seo Sang Gong!

463
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,780
Yes, Mama.

464
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,300
Gather the whole family into my chambers.

465
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:37,150
I will not stay like an old grandmother,
and not do anything to help this poor girl out!

466
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,930
I'll do just as you ask, Mama.

467
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:47,320
That can be done of this terrible situation of the Hwang Sil.

468
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,480
TaeJa Jeonha has just arrived.

469
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:10,320
Jeonha, please come sit next to me.

470
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,860
It is all right, please come sit next to me.

471
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:44,520
Well, the reason why I have gathered all of you here today is because of the Princess.

472
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:50,040
How can such a young Princess,
be left to sit there all night like that!

473
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,760
I'm deeply sorry, Mama.

474
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,210
At this time,
I do think that it's time to pardon the Princess.

475
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,930
The way she's asking for forgiveness,
is just so tear some.

476
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,600
However, Bingung has lied to us.

477
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:14,080
Also, she's not stating who it was
that she was with that night.

478
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,580
Do you not think there is a reason for that?

479
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:24,980
If the Princess has nothing to hide,
then why wouldn't she state the truth?

480
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:30,580
She was with me that night.

481
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,630
Yul.

482
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,210
Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

483
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:49,900
That night, I saw the Princess leave,
and I followed her out.

484
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,900
What did you say?

485
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,250
She was with you, Hwi Sung Dae Goon?

486
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,560
Yes, Pyeha.

487
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:12,820
I believe that the Princess was a little down in spirit,
so he must of gone to see what was the matter.

488
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:18,610
Yul Sung Dae Goon, I want you to answer my questions truthfully from this point on.

489
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,890
Yes, Pyeha.

490
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:29,700
Do you happen to have a different kind of
feeling towards the Princess?

491
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,320
Pyeha! What kind of question is that!?

492
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,690
Yes.

493
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,690
I do have a special kind of feelings towards the Princess.

494
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,250
I waited, and I waited my legs felt like they
were going to break, but I still waited!

495
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:32,270
No matter how angry you were with me, I thought
that at least you would come!

496
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,080
I'm going to make you live here with me forever.

497
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,400
That's for all my scars,
and for all the times you turned your back on me.

498
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:48,270
Give Chaegyung to me,
and you take over the King's throne!

499
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:56,150
Either throw them both out or let them both stay.

500
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,410
A person's feelings are not like a paper
where you can just fold it away.

501
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,640
Yul Sung Dae Goon!

502
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,080
I can't just fold it away somewhere.

503
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,700
He's been thrown out from the Palace before.

504
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,550
Does it make sense to throw him out again?
That's just wrong!

505
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:15,440
I guess this might be my last chance.

506
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:21,410
At this time, what am I supposed to be saying?
No one has ever taught me.
