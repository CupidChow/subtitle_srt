1
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,450
Episode 7

2
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,200
We didn't even know that
she returned to our country.

3
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,560
No matter if it's Hye Jung Goong
who didn't inform us beforehand

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,330
or from the Royal family's side,
both sides have nothing else to say about it.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,610
However, Mama...

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,540
No matter what the situation is..

7
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,500
To the mother and son who had been living
in the foreign country for a long time.

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,600
Giving them a warm welcome is what us,
the Royal family should do.

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,040
What's your opinion, great Queen?

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,710
Yes, of course. That should be the way.

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,980
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't sleep last night.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,320
Because I was worried about the Royal family's
bloodline and the future of the Royal family.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,420
It looks like we must solve the future generation
problem as quick as possible.

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,890
We must hurry about having the Prince
and the Princess share one room.

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,750
Mama, the Prince and the Princess are
still young and they're still high schoolers..

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,040
Who cares about their ages? If you look at
their ages, they are already old enough.

17
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,410
We have to go to say our morning greetings,
have you prepared already?

18
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,720
About yesterday, I was really moved!

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,990
It felt like I was really the
main character in a fairy tale story.

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,210
Especially in front of people..
in front of millions of foreigners.

21
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,080
I feel like a fool..

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,190
I was so embarrassed when my shoe fell off.

23
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,670
And at that moment...

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,160
The fairytale's over.
Stop dreaming now.

25
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,420
Huh?

26
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,610
And also, when you wear any
evening gowns in the future.

27
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,070
It's best if you stop wearing those tight fitting dresses.

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,010
Why?

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,970
Nothing besides that your legs are so thick,
it can even kick a cow to death.

30
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,250
Cow...?!

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,670
Are you ready, Prince?
It's time for you to say your morning greetings.

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,820
Yul Goon!

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
Did you get home safely yesterday?

34
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,260
Hey!

35
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,280
Hey, the teacher's looking for you.
She asked me to call you.

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,710
Right now? Me?

37
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,460
Sit down.

38
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,180
Sam...

39
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,720
I had forgotten completely that we had a test...

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,970
So, I couldn't prepare.

41
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,930
Actually, it's because of the morning greetings...

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,760
Sign here.

43
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,430
Huh?

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,980
What kind of signing?

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,950
My niece wanted me to get
her a signature of the Princess.

46
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,070
Really?

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,050
That's right.

48
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,760
Her name is Shin Na Ryung.

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,610
Shin Na Ryung. Stay bright.

50
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,800
Then, Hyorin got dumped?

51
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,940
Or else, why would the Prince marry another girl?

52
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,100
But that's odd.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,830
Why did he leave Min Hyorin and
marry that Shin Chaegyung?

54
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,920
That's right.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,760
But if I were the Prince, I would have chosen
Min Hyorin over Shin Chaegyung.

56
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,810
Anyway, I feel bad for Min Hyorin.

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,110
She nearly became the Princess.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Then, the back Palace is now Ahn Hee Bin?

59
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,910
It's not Jung Hee Bin now but Min Hee Bin.

60
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,890
That's right! She's a little too pitiful.

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,560
That's true.
She always has to see him everyday at school.

62
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,840
And they're in the same club, too.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,650
How awkward would that be?

64
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,840
If I were her,
I would immigrate somewhere else.

65
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,550
How could you live like this when everything
happened right in front of your eyes?

66
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,510
I ran away from home once.

67
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,230
As I took the train,
I arrived at some unknown place.

68
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,280
I sat on a long bench, to take a rest at an old
broken-down train station waiting room.

69
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,370
I've seen that face many times somewhere.

70
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,800
Did you run away from home, too?

71
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,760
And that's the first time I met him.

72
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,030
Hey, Hyorin.. did you see the news?

73
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,210
There's so many commotions
going on because of Yul.

74
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,420
As the other successor candidate,
the second place Prince has arrived.

75
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,160
He arrived at the party like in those movies.

76
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,100
But Yul's mom is not the ordinary kind of beauty.
She's just my type.

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,210
Stop it.

78
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,410
Why?

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,230
At the party, Shin and the duck looked
matching together in the pictures.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,340
Hyorin, where are you going?

81
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,580
Knock! Knock!

82
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,640
Do you know?

83
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,310
Shin Goon looks better when he's smiling.

84
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,650
When I first saw Shin Goon,
I was wondering why he never smiled.

85
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,900
But later on, I realized he likes to smile a lot.

86
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,950
Smile often, you look brighter when you smile.

87
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,150
And so, I pasted Shin Goon's picture on both sides.

88
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,750
Voila!

89
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,650
It's funny, it's comical, right?
Look carefully..

90
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,600
You're mad.. You smile.. You're mad.. You smile.. You smile.. You're mad.. You smile..

91
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,950
Cold as ice.. Smiling.. unhappy..

92
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,960
I hope you didn't forget what you said last time?

93
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,940
What?

94
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,340
What do you mean?

95
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,350
You said last time that you
would let me go to my house.

96
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,090
I didn't see my parents,
the last time they came here.

97
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,600
I wanted to ask you in
the morning when we said our greetings.

98
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,900
But there wasn't a single free time...
no free time.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,170
Anyway.. and so..

100
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,700
Did you finish the Filial piety's teachings?

101
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,660
No yet...

102
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,440
Then, it would be difficult.

103
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,290
Just think about it..

104
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,470
If you were the Queen who gave more
than two to three hours of her time

105
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,390
to the daughter-in-law who still
can't even finish the Filial piety book,

106
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,520
can you say, "Let me go back home first and
continue my studies later.."?

107
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,550
Can you say that?

108
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,550
Yes.

109
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,650
If you have time to make such a toy,
why don't you learn one more word?

110
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't ever mention about going home.

111
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,700
Let's go.

112
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,650
How could there be such a mean Prince?

113
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,240
I'll show you!

114
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,660
Mama, you're a little late.

115
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,830
The Prince already left to go to the
Tae Woo Jeon to say his greetings.

116
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,300
Hello.

117
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,920
Mama, the Princess has arrived in the morning hours.

118
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,770
Let her in.

119
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,400
Your dress is really pretty today.

120
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,010
Don't you agree?

121
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,490
Yes. These colors suit the morning mood.

122
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,240
Yes, it seems like my heart is
brightening because of it.

123
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,430
The Prince is already a grown man.

124
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,300
Hmm?

125
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,460
He came to me early in the morning to get permission
to stay at Chaegyung's house for a few days.

126
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,220
What?

127
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,810
To me, I think it's a good idea for the Prince to
stay in a different environment for a few days.

128
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,090
It'll be a great help to the
future Royal family's successor.

129
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,020
What do you think, great Queen?

130
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,540
It's a newly-wed wedding..

131
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,130
The groom is supposed to stay a few days in the
house of the in-laws after the wedding ends.

132
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,250
Isn't that supposed to be our traditional practice?

133
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:36,720
I also think it's better to let the Princess make a
trip back before she starts missing her home.

134
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,060
What do you think, Queen?

135
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,770
What you said is very logical, Mama..

136
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,150
So, what do you think Princess?
You don't have other plans, right?

137
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,480
No, I'm fine with it.

138
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,500
Thank you, Queen.
Thank you, great Queen.

139
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,450
Thank you, Queen... King.

140
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,780
Hey! Let's leave together.

141
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,780
Mama, Yul Sang Goon has arrived in the morning hours.

142
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,110
Let him in!

143
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,120
Thanks!

144
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,270
I didn't know about it.
I was just upset that you left without me.

145
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,510
I'm so dumb!

146
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,120
How many rooms do you have in your house?

147
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,020
Huh?

148
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,960
I must have a room to myself.

149
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,350
Understand?

150
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,660
It's going to be so hard staying over at your house.

151
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,050
Should I just tell them that I can't go?

152
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,770
Hey! That's not right!
You can't do that!

153
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,870
If you don't want to go,
I'm going to go back by myself then.

154
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,150
Yeah, right!

155
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,980
Do you think they will let you go alone?

156
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,170
They only agreed because I was going.

157
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,770
Isn't that so?

158
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,870
Right.

159
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,540
Ah~ Seja Jeonha~!
Why are you like this again?

160
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,110
Let go! What's wrong with you?

161
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,780
You're going, right? Huh? Let's go!

162
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,380
Mister! Do you see the cleaners over there?
You need to make a right turn there.

163
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,220
Yes, I know, Mama.

164
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,510
Chaegyung! You came! You came!

165
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,590
Welcome.

166
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,010
Hey, let's go in.

167
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,780
Hurry, come on in!

168
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,700
Come in.

169
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,290
Come in.

170
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,740
Hey!

171
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,180
You're supposed to take
your shoes off and come in!

172
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,890
In Eastern Goong's Western Hall,
you're allowed to wear shoes in the rooms.

173
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,370
But still...

174
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,410
Why are you always...?

175
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Chaegyung!

176
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,500
It's kind of small.

177
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,450
Please sit comfortably.

178
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,480
Yes, the Prince couple have arrived at the Princess's house in Sam Cheong Dong.

179
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,280
Originally they have arranged to
have a large group of police guards.

180
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,500
But it was cancelled at the request of the Crown Prince..

181
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,990
Hello! I am the Princess's brother, Shin ChaeJoon.

182
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,010
I heard that both of them will be at my home today.
So, I have especially brought a gift of a bra..

183
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,720
Hey! Get him out!

184
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,640
.. and underwear..

185
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,480
Get him out! What are you doing?!
Take him out!

186
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,390
Reporting from Sam Cheong Dong,
Kim Jo Hwa, MBC News.

187
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,400
Hey, you should not only eat rice
but eat other side dishes, too.

188
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,860
Yes.

189
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,730
I cooked the best I could.

190
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,530
But maybe it seems like the side dishes
are not suitable to your taste.

191
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,300
I heard that 12 dishes are only consider to be half table at the king's dining table.

192
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,520
We added another to make it 13 dishes..

193
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,510
How can you say that there are 13 dishes?
They are not counted this way.

194
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,500
No.

195
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,320
The dishes in Goong are also quite simple these days.

196
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,320
How simple are they, when there's so many varieties?
There are lots of dishes.

197
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,620
Shin Goon have to examines the food one by one.
Every morning..

198
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,450
You have to do that?

199
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,540
Ya!

200
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,540
How could you call him Shin Goon?
You should call him "Prince" or "Honey".

201
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,680
ChaeJoon!

202
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,100
Also, you can't eat "sang choo sam".
*a dumpling but with lettuce wrapped with rice, spices, meat inside*

203
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Huh? Why?

204
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,800
Why?

205
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,640
The Royal family are not allowed
to eat "sang choo sam".

206
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,990
Not only this, the Royal family
are not allowed to run.

207
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,900
The Royal family are not allowed
to show their bare feet as well.

208
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh my, there are so many things
that you are not allowed to do.

209
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,790
But why can't you eat "sang choo sam"?

210
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,800
I don't know.

211
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,210
You can't eat it because it
doesn't give good impressions.

212
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,800
That doesn't make sense!

213
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,810
I'm worried if he's doing well.

214
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm talking about the Prince.

215
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,760
It's not like he went to a difficult place.

216
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,180
The hardship will be less
since the Princess is with him.

217
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,650
Except those overseas visits, it's his first time spending the nights in a new place.

218
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,320
Don't you think his social experience is too little if he only goes to school and the Palace?

219
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,520
Let's think of it as a good opportunity for him to meet new people and see how the world revolves.

220
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,110
Yes, King.

221
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,290
During your stay here,
please use the main bedroom.

222
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,110
Although it's really simple,
it's the room where we both sleep in.

223
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,580
But anyway,
the main bedroom is our best room.

224
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,820
What are you so nervous about?

225
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,500
It's better if you could just be more casual with me.

226
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,350
It's not like I came here to get a special treatment.

227
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,350
I just wanted to see how an ordinary family lives.

228
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,330
Oh, I see.

229
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,290
That's why I didn't let Kim Sang Gong who's in charge of the food and all those bodyguards, etc.. to follow me.

230
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,290
So, please treat me with comfort.

231
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,820
Yes.

232
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,450
But really...

233
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,350
What are we going to do if there are only 2 rooms?

234
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,040
You said he's doing exams this week.

235
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,820
Yes, that seems to be so...

236
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,820
Then, I'll use your room.

237
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,670
How about if you put a tent up outside?

238
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,880
Yes.. What?!

239
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,380
There's fresh air and the weather's cool.
Don't you think you'll study better?

240
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,390
I was just kidding.. Just joking!
Why are you so surprised?

241
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,210
He usually tells corny jokes.

242
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,470
Ah, so you have that kind of personality.

243
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,190
Then, we'll both share the same room.

244
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,260
Why?

245
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,260
Are you afraid that something might happen?

246
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,370
No...

247
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,530
It's not that...

248
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,800
Are you alright?

249
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,870
What are you doing?
How could you escape alone?

250
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,970
How unfair!
I was about to die from his corny jokes!

251
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,860
He's a strong rival! Strong rival..
To us, he's really a difficult person to handle.

252
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,540
That's true. His charisma is off the hook!
I can't say anything to him.

253
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,500
This is his first night here,
we can't let them slip away like this.

254
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,120
That's right. What should we do?

255
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,580
Hey, what should we do..
ChaeJoon?

256
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,060
What about this: 3-6-9! 3-6-9!

257
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,780
3-6-9! 3-6-9!

258
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,320
3..

259
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,810
Hey, it's too childish.

260
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,730
Then what about this:
Dibi-dibi-dib! Dibi-dibi-dib!

261
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,340
Do you think the Prince would go: Dibi-dibi-dib!?

262
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,980
We should've assigned a program
if this was going to happen.

263
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,450
Let's put our heads together and think right now.

264
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:36,650
Okay.

265
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
Come here.

266
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,790
What the?

267
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,520
So you slept, ate, and studied here?
You did all that in here?

268
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,340
That's why I told you to sleep at
my parents's room when I told you so.

269
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,470
You can still go there now, leave quickly.

270
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,450
But there's a big problem.

271
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,440
What?

272
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,910
You and I are two people, but the bed...
the bed is single.

273
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,770
Are you crazy right now?!

274
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,600
I slept here on this bed for 19 years.

275
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,750
You sleep on the floor.

276
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,470
For 19 years,
I have been sleeping on a bed as big as your room.

277
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,310
Ya! Why are you taking your clothes off?

278
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,270
I don't care anymore!

279
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,070
You can get the blankets and
sleep on the floor or whatever.

280
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,110
Really?

281
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,870
Then we can sleep together.

282
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,780
Ya! You really?!

283
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,700
So you came home with me
to make my life miserable?

284
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,550
Yeah.

285
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,250
Is it fun to play around with me?

286
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,140
Yeah.

287
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,410
You are just like an amazing toy
who spices up my boring life.

288
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,630
(A toy, you say?)

289
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,250
Fine! Okay! Just do whatever you want!

290
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,470
I'm not the type to stay still so you won't be able
to last even one hour before you fall!

291
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,980
Today in the afternoon,
the Prince arrived at the Princess's house.

292
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,190
He will be spending 2 days and 3 nights, which will be his first time spent at the Princess's house after marriage.

293
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,310
He's received a lot of attention from welcoming people. The reporters are now fighting for an interview.

294
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,920
Many people from the Princess's house...
Should I turn it off?

295
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,450
They came early in the morning.

296
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,020
It gives you a lot of attention, right?

297
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,600
If you're starting to forget,
the Prince couple's news always happen to show.

298
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,290
It'll be fine.

299
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,350
Time will heal everything.

300
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,690
Are you okay?

301
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,150
It's okay.

302
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm okay.

303
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,970
Honestly, I'm not okay.

304
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,800
In the beginning, I thought I would be okay.

305
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,450
But as time goes on, my heart feels like hell.

306
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,830
Drop me off at the yoga center.

307
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,580
Focus on your breathing.

308
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,110
Slowly breathe in.

309
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,170
Right now, your deep worries..

310
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:18,950
...jeopardies, hatred, selfish, jealousy...

311
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,550
...throw all that away,
and just focus on your body and mind set.

312
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,760
If your mind and selfishness overcomes,
the focus will not work.

313
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,310
Control your heart to have a good mind set.

314
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,320
I can't sleep.

315
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,990
It's so hard to sleep by looking at the wall.

316
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,230
It's so uncomfortable to sleep
straight as it's so cramped.

317
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,810
And on this side, it's Shin Goon's back.

318
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,750
Ah... but it's weird.

319
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,550
How could I... how could I not hate this?

320
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,290
This small bed and a tall
build guy is sleeping on it as well.

321
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm looking at the guy's back in this situation..
no, it's not that I hate it.

322
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,780
What's with me? So I'm this type of person.

323
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,250
Under the moonlight, his back...

324
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,710
Should I pretend that I don't know anything?

325
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,220
What if I suddenly grasp him like a hungry wolf?

326
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,690
Should I just sleep on the floor?

327
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,040
No. If so, I'll be on the losers end.

328
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,450
[Flowing Saliva]

329
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,360
She looks like a wizard?

330
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,480
This book... this book's author.

331
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,200
Wizard?

332
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,080
Don't you think so?

333
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,860
One who's jobless or one who's divorced.

334
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,990
They still have to worry about their livelihood.

335
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,980
Someone, all of a sudden, becomes a worldwide famous best seller author in a day.

336
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,720
She obeys the devil,
having this as one of the conditions.

337
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,740
Could she have betrayed your own soul?

338
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,090
You are into your people theory again?

339
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,980
Looking from afar..

340
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,950
It looks very quiet and peaceful.

341
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,600
What I want is this kind of peace.

342
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,340
If you can be made the King...

343
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,450
I'll make a deal with the devil.

344
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,110
your forgotten dad,
the position you once held.

345
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,810
I must bring for them back to place again.

346
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,610
This is the reason why SohHoYoung must live.

347
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,250
The reflection of mine...

348
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,490
is the total opposite of me.

349
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,810
But it's still a part of me.

350
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,310
I'm unable to worry about and
calm my reflection.

351
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,180
I'm sad and disappointed.

352
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,980
Go take a look and see if they need anything.

353
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,320
What?

354
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,880
Should we deliver them some drinks?

355
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,370
Oh please, they would have slept long ago.

356
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,130
Don't think so.

357
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,220
Their lights are still on, there are noises..
Seems like they're still awake.

358
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,040
Bring them some juice.

359
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,680
It must've been much more comfortable in the Palace..

360
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:43,190
Like room service in hotels,
it satisfies all your needs.

361
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Madam Lee...

362
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,540
Do you want me to do it?

363
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,950
Oh, why are you nagging so much?

364
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,920
If you want to do it, do it yourself.

365
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,860
Seems like they're asleep.

366
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,390
Then put it down and we'll leave.

367
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,610
Oh my!

368
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,040
Who's that?

369
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,980
What's going on?

370
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,170
Oh my back.. my back!

371
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,330
AHHHHH!

372
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,140
YOU GET DOWN!

373
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,430
Then..
do you want to go to the living room now?

374
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,260
No. I don't want to receive special treatments.

375
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,510
We'll solve it between the two of us.

376
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,130
The two of them..

377
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,150
Pounced on... I pounced onto him.

378
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
That pose just now...

379
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,770
it's obvious that I pounced onto him.

380
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,500
How could it be?

381
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,710
Shin Chaegyung.

382
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,740
What should we do?

383
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,500
That...

384
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,550
while sleeping, I accidentally...
it won't happen again.

385
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,850
You sure?

386
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,280
I don't trust you.

387
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,290
Is that so?

388
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,170
Then.. I'll sleep on the floor.

389
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,390
So cute!

390
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,200
[Surprisingly they are the affectionate couple!]

391
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,110
rock-paper-scissors .. SHOOT!

392
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,220
rock-paper-scissors .. SHOOT!

393
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,630
Hey! You didn't even change it.
You kept it out.

394
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,780
Get up quickly.

395
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,980
Don't go back on your words.

396
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,010
rock-paper-scissors .. SHOOT!

397
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,250
Yah~~!! Get up!

398
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,170
The smell is great! Dear..

399
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,830
How is it?

400
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,610
You can stop cooking.

401
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,230
Prince, you're hungry, right?

402
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,760
We're preparing, so wait a moment.

403
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,010
No, I'm not hungry.

404
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,860
I'm all right, you can cook at your own pace.

405
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,250
Not done yet?

406
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,290
I want to eat "sang choo sam".

407
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,830
Hm? sang choo sam?

408
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,940
Okay, you go get some in the vegetations.

409
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,800
The Prince is hungry,
we have to prepare quickly.

410
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,570
Want to tag along?

411
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,500
Oh, okay.

412
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,880
My parents planted these.

413
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,670
They don't use pesticides...
totally harmless.

414
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,850
It's really delicious.

415
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,510
Want to try?

416
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,130
It's interesting and fun in a way.

417
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,180
Come on!

418
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,180
You're not supposed to get that,
get that big one...

419
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,550
Don't use the spade, guys have to use their hands.

420
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,450
Use your hands.

421
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,280
What is this?

422
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,830
These are spring onions.

423
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,540
These are radishes.

424
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,840
These are cabbages.

425
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,480
Hey, health nutrient!

426
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,910
What is this?

427
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,970
That's water pail.

428
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,160
They don't even teach that in the Palace?

429
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,340
Yah! Babo Shin, hurry up!

430
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,690
And a guy is supposed to carry this.

431
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,940
Quick... hold it, quick!

432
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,400
What are these? The roots aren't removed.

433
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,150
My mouth is about to water. Oh please!

434
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,540
Delicious!

435
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,770
It's all right. This place isn't the Palace.

436
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,200
I'll keep it a secret.

437
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,590
It's a secret, ok!

438
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,980
Open bigger.

439
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,270
Delicious?

440
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,990
What are all these?

441
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,200
This is for Dad.

442
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,530
This is for Mom.

443
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,460
How about me?

444
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,500
This is also for Mom.

445
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,630
One, two, three!

446
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,360
Altitude, temperature, pressure..

447
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,600
they're the three functions.

448
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,620
You pig! You only came out nice!

449
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,580
Our Prince should be having breakfast now, right?

450
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,830
Yes, his Mother-in-law would certainly serve them well.

451
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,000
The Prince is a picky eater, will he be used to it?

452
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,370
I've told him,
not to show any unhappiness in any situation.

453
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,440
Yes, you must.

454
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,640
You cannot be impolite to the parents of the Princess.

455
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,890
Let's eat.

456
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,620
Hae Sang Gong is back,
Yi Sang Goon is also back.

457
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,720
If Hae Ming,
who's studying overseas would come back too,

458
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,860
our Royal Family would be able to gather together.

459
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:11,030
We can see each other everyday, and even chat together eye to eye, and eat together.

460
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:16,820
Soon this day will come, right?

461
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,380
Yes, UmmaMama.

462
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,780
I've told her she must come back
once the holiday starts, Mama.

463
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,600
That's good.

464
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,230
What?!

465
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,650
Really?

466
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,260
You've reached the end.

467
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,670
I've already said nothing happened...

468
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,290
...yet.

469
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,470
So, you mean tonight you will?

470
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,910
Hey! I'm not some pervert.

471
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,480
I'm not trying to say that.

472
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,240
How should I say? I'm going crazy.

473
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,590
Ya! Isn't it time to go in?

474
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,420
There's still a lot of time left!

475
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,870
There's no time left!

476
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,980
Really? You shared the same room?

477
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,960
And on the same bed?

478
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,620
You two are getting on really fast.

479
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,120
Maybe tonight, you two will really...

480
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,550
Million miles of long way?

481
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,330
Shut up!

482
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,570
But you two are underage,
are you allowed to do it?

483
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,720
What problem is there? They're already a couple.

484
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,110
You should've done it faster.

485
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,640
Stop. It won't happen again in the future.

486
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,780
What do you mean by "in the future"?

487
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,610
Then... something really happened?

488
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,700
I've said nothing happened.

489
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,980
If nothing happened,
I guess you were a bit disappointed then?

490
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,490
What is there to be disappointed about?

491
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,700
You should be careful.

492
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,600
Careful of?

493
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,520
Nowadays, girls do the initiation..

494
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,540
Who knows..

495
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,750
She might attack you suddenly from behind.

496
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,580
What?

497
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,160
Girls nowadays aren't simple.

498
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,040
We, the boys, should be more careful.

499
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,740
- A quiet cat.
- Correct!

500
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,200
Those kind of people are the scariest.

501
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,810
From the outside they look innocent.

502
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,280
Even she, herself doesn't even know her desires.

503
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,430
Once you meet those kind of girls,
they go on a fast pace in relationships.

504
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,300
Nasty girl!

505
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,940
That's why next time, you should just grab him!

506
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,920
Yes! You guys are already a married couple.

507
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,450
Hey! You guys...

508
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,570
Is that what a student should say?

509
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,810
What's wrong with it?

510
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,190
Once a girl reaches 18,
there's no need for parents approval to get married.

511
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,980
She's now a wife of someone.

512
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,390
That's right, they are already a married couple.

513
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,630
“Skinship” is important between a couple.

514
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,720
What “skinship”?

515
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,520
I'm embarrassed, stop it.

516
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,880
That's what I'm saying...

517
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,800
How can a girl initiate?

518
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,900
Those girls that initiate are all
perverts or lower-classed people.

519
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,100
Right? Shin Chaegyung?

520
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,770
That's right...

521
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,040
Perverts.. lower-classed..

522
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,120
I don't know what happened.

523
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:12,750
Mom, Dad, and even Chaejoon.. all left saying they have work to do, and we are the only ones that are left.

524
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,940
Although I'm trying to hide it,

525
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,380
I mean, ever since we slept together last nite,

526
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:28,290
my heart pounds whenever I see his back.

527
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,010
Darn it! I've got a strange feeling.

528
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,300
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

529
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,190
How about shin ramen with egg?

530
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,170
I'm full.

531
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,880
You've finished your food already?

532
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,730
You're quite good at cooking noodles.

533
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,130
Let me see...

534
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,450
What's happening to me?

535
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,350
Am I a pervert?

536
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,280
Although they say skinship is important...

537
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,850
I'll wash the dishes.

538
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,390
It's okay.

539
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,590
How can you...

540
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,450
Why? You think I can't?

541
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm a boy-scout member.

542
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,800
Go watch TV. Don't get in the way.

543
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,100
Never mind. Let me do it.

544
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,590
I thought I told you to go watch TV.

545
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,200
Hey~

546
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,790
Don't move.

547
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,890
Turn around.

548
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,350
[What did I do?]

549
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,100
Just now, when you were doing yoga,
you were really nervous.

550
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,720
Facing problems?

551
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,840
No.., maybe it's due to exam preparations.

552
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,320
How was life in England?

553
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,990
Very good.
A place suitable for my son and I.

554
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,530
England is an interesting country.

555
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,920
The people place a lot of concern for the Royals.

556
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,520
Very similar to our country.

557
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,200
Recently, Prince Charles and Camilla had a wedding too.

558
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,940
Oh yeah, have you heard about Camilla?

559
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,610
Yes. I saw the news report,
they said she's Prince Charles' lover.

560
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,630
They fell in love with each other at first sight,
long before their marriages,

561
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,330
but because of the royal traditions,
Prince Charles couldn't marry Camilla.

562
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:44,660
However, whenever he faces a problem, he'll seek Camilla to chat. She's like a sister to him.

563
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,260
The contradictions with Diana becomes deeper and the more the chats with Camilla grew..

564
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:56,400
In the end, they assured each other's love,
and got together.

565
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,530
Diana once said...

566
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,370
“Our marriage became complicated
because of three people.”

567
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,720
The Prince and Princess couple
and Camilla's triangle relationship.

568
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,690
Complicated to such an extent.

569
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:18,230
A long and agonizing triangle relationship,
lasted 30 years.

570
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,250
In the end, after 35 years of waiting...

571
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,680
A person of tolerance
- Camilla, successfully married Prince Charles.

572
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,500
She has found her lover.

573
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,790
Not getting down?

574
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,850
Another round?

575
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,520
Min Hyorin... cannot give up just like that.

576
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,810
What are you saying?

577
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,280
Cannot give up what?

578
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,640
She doesn't suit him.

579
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,880
Shin needs me by his side.

580
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,330
Help me get Shin back.

581
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:50,390
Who is it?

582
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,940
It's me, Hyorin.

583
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,060
It's my turn.

584
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,330
Yuch, on your back.

585
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,740
Du, ge, kwan, yuch..

586
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,340
Quick.

587
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,550
This is our last one.
If it's a dog then we'll win.

588
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,990
Scalp, mucus...

589
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,820
Dad, you're disgusting. Oh please...

590
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:33,480
Dog, dog, dog.

591
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,440
It's du.

592
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,070
Oh, what happened?

593
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,120
Ahhh..

594
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,590
Yuch yuch.

595
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,890
This time, once we have dog, we'll win.

596
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,460
Pig.. you moved the mat, right?

597
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,150
No, I didn't.

598
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,250
Then is it, brother-in-law?

599
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,600
No, I didn't do anything.

600
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,480
Then why did it change? It was dog just now.

601
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,510
So, they're the legendary cheating couple in gambling?

602
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,220
No!!

603
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,410
It's dog, we win!

604
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,470
2 vs. 1

605
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,150
Come on, put your hand out.

606
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,030
Don't be so hard on me.

607
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,580
Okay, not to worry.

608
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,610
Ready?

609
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,540
One, two, three.

610
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,150
Quick, let's continue.

611
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,680
Madam Lee, Chaejoon, you guys!

612
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,860
Don't make it too hard.

613
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,250
Cannot. Losers have to face it.

614
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,160
Very painful!

615
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,390
One, two, three.

616
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,390
Rules breaking pig,
look at how I'll be punishing you.

617
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,730
One, two, three.

618
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,730
Pain.. pain..

619
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,800
Baddies.. all swollen..

620
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,410
Who asked you to lose?

621
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
The next one is..

622
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,360
What to do?

623
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,860
The Prince's body is of royalty.

624
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,510
That's okay.

625
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,630
I'm sorry.

626
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,590
One, two, three.

627
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,770
Now, it's my turn.

628
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,390
One, two, three.

629
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,450
What is this? You all hit me so hard,
compared to him.

630
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,820
Why? We did it willingly. CHECK

631
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,140
Okay. Pig.
I'll make it three times more painful.

632
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,860
It's my turn. Brother-in-law, be careful.

633
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,510
One, two, three.

634
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,900
Shin Goon, are you all right?

635
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,120
Look! It's SO red..

636
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,550
Chaejoon, you?!

637
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,720
Not my fault, it's the game's rules.

638
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:18,020
“Not to touch the Royal's body.”
That's one of the laws in the Palace.

639
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,050
Then what should we do?

640
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,140
Apply some red medicine on it?

641
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,880
Pig... will I be caught?

642
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,910
This fella.. catch what?

643
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,400
I don't care... give me the sticks.

644
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,480
Okay. No mercy for losers.

645
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,760
Come on, let's cheer.

646
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,560
Again?

647
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,450
One, two, three... fighting!

648
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,140
One, two, three... fighting!
