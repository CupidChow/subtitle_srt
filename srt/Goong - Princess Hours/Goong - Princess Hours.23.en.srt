1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,400
[Prince. I'm in Yul Goon's room right now.
Hurry up and come.]

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,050
Shin Chaegyung!

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,610
Fire! Fire!!

4
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,420
There's a fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!!

5
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,270
Chaegyung...

6
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,250
Episode 23

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,290
So how is the investigation going?

8
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,210
Since it has been proven to be a set fire, we are organizing the information from the witnesses.

9
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,230
So... is there any suspect in mind?

10
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,220
I am very sorry to tell you this...

11
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,220
But from the investigation so far,
it is the Crown Prince.

12
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,280
That's impossible!

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,250
Why am I being the suspect?

14
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,290
TaeJa Jeonha, you said you went there because Princess sent you a message, right?

15
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,270
Yes.

16
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,220
But on Princess' phone, there has been no record of sending you the text message.

17
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,200
Did you check the phone company?

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,230
The phone number that was used to send the message was not even a registered number.

19
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:22,200
Therefore, everything that the Crown Prince has told us, has been confirmed to be false.

20
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,220
TaeJa Jeonha, you should reveal the truth now.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,210
Shin Goon is the suspect? That is impossible!

22
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,250
But for now, from what the witnesses had said,

23
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,240
the Crown Prince's information has been different.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,250
Then, does that mean Shin Goon lied?

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,240
I am sorry.

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,250
No, it's okay. I don't know where things started to go wrong but I am certain he didn't do it.

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,280
The information and evidences makes Jeonha the suspect.

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,210
Who do you think sent the message that Shin Goon read?

29
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,210
I am worried.
I think Shin Goon is afflicted because of me.

30
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,260
Where is he now?

31
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,210
The investigation ended,
and now he is talking with the king.

32
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,250
I have to see him.

33
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,280
What do you think about this nonsense?

34
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,270
I have no way to escape.
I guess I end up being the victim.

35
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,240
Is that what a Crown Prince would say?

36
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,250
What is the actual truth?

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,250
TaeJa, please tell us the truth.

38
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,290
It's not a problem that
can be solved if you don't say anything.

39
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,280
I am innocent.

40
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,280
Why are you always being
the centre of all the problems?

41
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,230
Bingung Mama.

42
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,250
Shin Goon is so distressed.

43
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,230
Shin Goon is crying.

44
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,240
You should go in, Mama.

45
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,210
He secretly cries all alone.

46
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,230
He doesn't have anyone who can get a pat on the back.

47
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,230
And I made him get into all this trouble.

48
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,200
I am so sorry.
So sorry that I can't even comfort him.

49
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,200
If we were a little bit late,
it would have been dangerous.

50
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,280
Its okay. I have to get a little injured so I feel like I was reborn.

51
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,280
Since I risked my life for it, this is nothing.

52
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,230
You're sure there is no evidence left behind?

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,220
Definitely. We successfully erased the record of Bingung Mama phone call.

54
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,280
We were able to keep everyone who has been involved quiet.

55
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,200
About the transferring of the funds,
how are you going to settle it?

56
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
All funds are transferred through 5 different countries.

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,220
It will be very difficult to check who transferred the money.

58
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,210
You really are someone who has professional training,
worthy to service me.

59
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,220
Yes. Mama.

60
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,230
But you cannot let Yul know about this.

61
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes, Tae-Hwang Mama.

62
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,200
There is no estimation of the damage yet.

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,280
and also the main suspect of this incident is the Crown Prince.

64
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,270
Shin Goon, are you okay?

65
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,220
How?

66
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,270
Too bad you can't go out from the palace like you wished, in this situation.

67
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,280
Your request for the exiling of the Crown Princess might be a bit tough to handle now.

68
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,210
I was worried.

69
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,210
Why? Because I am being the suspect?

70
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,240
If that is the case, take back your sympathy.

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,290
I'm not sympathizing you.

72
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
And also I know you are not the suspect.

73
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,220
How can you be so sure?

74
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:02,200
On the night of the fire, you asked me, "Where are you?", "Is anything wrong?"

75
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,230
Your eyes that day...
That look in Shin Goon's face will not lie.

76
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,250
I know that for sure.

77
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Why would anyone send a message
to you saying it was from me?

78
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I will allow you to go home after this is resolved.

79
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:30,250
I don't think there is any place you can breathe in this palace.

80
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
Did you find out?

81
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,260
On the night of the fire,
all the CCTVs in the palace had been stopped.

82
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,270
Jeonha, the investigation is continuing,
so please have hope.

83
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,270
I have no proof.

84
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,230
I am tightly trapped in this situation.

85
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,240
Gong Nae Gwan.

86
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,210
Yes, Jeonha.

87
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:40,220
I wanted to be free like a balloon.

88
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,260
When I became the Hwang TaeJa, I gave up everything.

89
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,270
But after I met Bingung, I was able to dream again.

90
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,270
I dreamed that if I was with Bingung I would be able to fly again.

91
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,270
Jeonha.

92
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,260
I always wanted to escape from being the Hwang TaeJa.

93
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,210
But not like this.

94
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,290
For sure, the truth will be revealed.

95
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:35,240
Are you okay? Are you sure you're okay?

96
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,200
If you knew there was a fire,
you should have escaped quickly.

97
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,270
Don't worry, Mom won't die.

98
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,230
Do you know how worried I was?

99
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,430
Who would have ever set the fire?

100
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,430
How can you not know?

101
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,430
TaeJa was so jealous, he wanted to kill you.

102
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,460
Mom. Shin is not that cruel.

103
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,480
Are you sure?

104
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,470
If one is jealous, one's thought will turn cruel.

105
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,450
What does that mean?

106
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,470
That is what jealousy is.

107
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:28,480
Just like changing the bridge.
Suspicion will lead to more troubles.

108
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,460
And finally one's thoughts will change.

109
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,440
No matter how prosperous TaeJa is, he is jealous.

110
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,400
His jealousy just caused this problem.

111
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
If he is assured to be the victim of the fire,

112
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,450
his time being the TaeJa won't be long.

113
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,430
Now my Prince just has to get ready.

114
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,430
Did you call me Dae Goon Mama?

115
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,400
I have one question to ask.

116
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,490
Yes. Please ask.

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,450
It's hard to believe that an outsider came in and set the fire.

118
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,440
By any chance, did my mom plan the fire?

119
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,420
No, Mama.

120
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,480
Is that so?

121
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,440
I heard that you had a tight relationship with my dad.

122
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,490
Is that why you are helping my mom?

123
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,400
I was your dad's assistant.

124
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,430
If it wasn't the help from the king, I wouldn't have lived.

125
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,490
I will risk my life to repay him.

126
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,410
I see. You may go now.

127
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,430
Bingung Mama, Tae-Hwang Tae-Hu Mama is here.

128
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,450
Bingung, can we talk for awhile?

129
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,410
Yes, Tae-Hwang Tae-Hu Mama.

130
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,410
Does Bingung still want to leave the palace?

131
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:59,430
I only thought of myself without
even thinking about the person I love.

132
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:06,420
I thought I would be happier if I leave the palace,
but now I don't know.

133
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,450
I don't know what I was trying to do or
how I was trying to get happier

134
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,430
I am so confused.

135
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I shouldn't have said anything
about divorcing or leaving the palace.

136
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,400
I made such a big mistake.

137
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,440
Bingung is only 19 years old.

138
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,400
Nineteen is the age to make mistakes.

139
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,430
You will make lots of mistakes,
and you should mistake at that age.

140
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:55,430
You have to go through everything that you should at your age in order to get old properly.

141
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,450
The most important thing is not the fact that you made a mistake,

142
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:06,420
but that you realize your mistakes and
gain courage to fix your mistakes.

143
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,480
Tae-Hwang Tae-Hu Mama Mama.

144
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,250
Father, the council elders opposed
the idea of kicking Yul out of the palace,

145
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,460
and supports the idea of exiling the Crown Princess.

146
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,480
That's also...

147
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,430
On top of the scandal, she asked for a divorce, this is not an overbearing request.

148
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,900
If Yul leaves the palace now,

149
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,450
there will be a lot of complications.

150
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,400
What I think is...

151
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,250
We should push this back for a while and
then think what we should do.

152
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,450
I also think like that, Pyeha.

153
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,440
We can't allow anymore actions to further smear the reputation of the royal family.

154
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,450
Okay then.

155
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,440
Hwi Sung Dae Goon and Bingung's problems...

156
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,100
...will be solved later on.

157
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,250
Phillip.

158
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,420
Did you check the Swiss Bank Accounts
that I asked you before?

159
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,180
Well...

160
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,550
The money was withdrawn
from my mother's accounts.

161
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,460
I see.

162
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,420
Then... could you send me the related documents?

163
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,430
And please check how the money was transferred.

164
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,470
And finally who received the money.

165
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,110
Yes.

166
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,250
Thank you.

167
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,440
Gong Nae Gwan Ajusshi.

168
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,490
Is Shin Goon alright?

169
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Perhaps he is too stressed out.
He has symptoms of vomiting.

170
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,470
Are you very sick?

171
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,460
You know how bad it is for your health to vomit.

172
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,850
Why do you care?

173
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm sorry.

174
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,490
I'm really sorry.

175
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,420
I won't say I will divorce.

176
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,250
I won't say that I will leave the palace.

177
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,250
The only reason I was able breathe inside the palace was because of Shin Goon.

178
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,410
That's why... I want to stay with you.

179
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,450
If we look at things now,

180
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't know if I will get dethrone from
the position of the Crown Prince. Then...

181
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,490
The person I love is not the Crown Prince, just you.

182
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,400
What?

183
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,250
What did you say?

184
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,060
I love you.

185
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,040
If my heart hurts so much, I think I love you.

186
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,000
If you stay by my side,

187
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,050
I might break your wings.

188
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't care.

189
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,080
Just say that you want me next to you.

190
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,070
Please stay by my side.

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Don't leave.

192
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,020
Don't leave me alone.

193
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,070
I am a victim of the fire,

194
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,070
but I feel like nothing is wrong now that I am here.

195
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:39,040
Shin is innocent so the truth will be revealed.

196
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:48,020
If I get dethrone,
you might have to work to feed me.

197
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Then, you do the housework.
I will go out make money.

198
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,050
How can a guy do the housework?

199
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,080
Who knows? It might suit you~

200
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,010
You're here?

201
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,020
Why didn't you answer the phone?

202
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,050
I was cleaning and putting the kids to sleep.

203
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,030
You call this cleaning?

204
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,060
I tried to clean. You don't like it?

205
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,070
What about the kids?

206
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,050
I put them to sleep.

207
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,000
You try to work. You know how exhausting it is?

208
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,040
I know... I know...

209
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,020
- What's that noise?
- Oh.. they're awake.

210
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Did you miss me?

211
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Did daddy take good care of you?

212
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,030
Mommy's here, mommy.. mommy...

213
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,010
What's this smell?

214
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,070
Again..?! Hurry go check.

215
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,010
Fire .. Hurry. The gas stove.

216
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,030
Oh my...
How can I leave the house and work outside?

217
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,090
That's impossible.

218
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You even saw me in the shower.

219
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,060
I didn't see it.

220
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,010
Even if I did, I didn't think of any other thoughts.

221
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,090
Are you sure you didn't have any other thoughts?

222
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah.

223
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,030
There is something on your hair.

224
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,060
Do you know this proverb?

225
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,760
"The person with the rice cake doesn't even have the intentions to give rice cake..."

226
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,080
"but another person is all excited to get it." Right?

227
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,070
I was just a little tired so I closed my eyes.

228
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,010
I want to go. Good night.

229
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,050
Where do you think you're going?

230
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:56,040
We have to have a celebration ceremony.

231
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,040
Well, after all we finally get back together.
It wouldn't be right to leave. Right?

232
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,060
Right.

233
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,050
With all the effort from
the representing Prince and Princess of Korea!

234
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,080
Way to go Korea!!

235
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,020
Way to go Korea!!

236
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,040
Shin Goon, you never tried something like this at the last world cup tournament.

237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,050
This is the top ceremony representing Korea.

238
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,030
Way to go Korea!!

239
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,010
Way to go Korea!!

240
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,030
Does she think I'm dumb...

241
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,040
Way to go Korea!!

242
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,020
I saw it.

243
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,090
So how is your health?

244
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,080
It wasn't a serious fire.
Please do not worry.

245
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,070
You are so fortunate that it wasn't serious.
It's very fortunate.

246
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:06,070
Do you have any idea who set the fire?

247
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,060
How would I know?

248
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:18,000
I was so surprised when I heard that
the suspect was the Crown Prince.

249
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,060
The victim must be captured soon.

250
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,050
So the Crown Prince to remain on the throne.

251
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,080
And also, the person who tried to kill my son has to be found.

252
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,010
Yes. We have to find the person
who is causing all these problems soon.

253
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,040
Then Korea will have peace once again.

254
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,070
Hey hey! Stop stop!

255
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Is it funny?

256
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,090
Stop it.

257
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,020
It's so funny.

258
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,030
Try it.

259
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,030
How is that fun? This is better.

260
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,030
I think it's time for you to tell the truth.

261
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,020
I don't understand what you are talking about.

262
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,030
You think I am not aware of your plans!

263
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,070
You are trying to accuse the Crown Prince as the victim to kick him off the throne.

264
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,040
Are you accusing me now?

265
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,040
That is not the way to treat
someone who died and came back.

266
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,080
He is your son.

267
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,070
But hiding one's true inner self is what humans are.

268
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,980
Will you ever give up?

269
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,070
One is able to obtain, but denies to gain.

270
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,050
That what is we call give up.

271
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,000
No one has gain anything at the moment.

272
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,010
Therefore "giving up" does not fit in this situation.

273
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,030
Your heart is occupied entirely with one person.

274
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,000
Your heart must feel like a prison.

275
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,030
And I understand how painful it is.

276
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:41,050
Halma Mama, I've lost all my emotions.

277
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:48,040
Now I can't erase or empty my heart.

278
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,020
It may be difficult, now.

279
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,000
You may not be able to control your pain.

280
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,050
When the time comes, it will blow away with the wind.

281
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Will it really happen?

282
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,020
Yes.

283
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,010
At the age of 19,
you may think that you will die without your emotions.

284
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:19,000
But you still have the life at 29, or the life at 30.

285
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,030
Yul...

286
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,040
There is a poem...

287
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:41,070
"From your eyes, I saw tears roll down..."

288
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:47,050
"And I realized that having a difficult life and crying at times..."

289
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:54,050
"...are not all that unpleasant..."

290
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,070
If I can never have you...

291
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,050
Every time I think of you, I feel thirsty...

292
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,060
And I can only cry foolishly alone.

293
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,050
Please continue the plans to dethrone the Crown Prince.

294
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,780
Also continue to carry out the issue of the Princess's exile.

295
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:54,020
It would be better to have problems occur for both the royal couple, wouldn't it?

296
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,000
Keep in mind. The Royal Palace needs new blood.

297
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,000
Where did you go?

298
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,040
Mom, let's stop all of this.

299
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,070
What are you talking about?

300
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,070
I know that you did it.

301
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,020
Do I look like a person who will put herself in the fire?

302
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,040
Are you going to continue to lie to me?

303
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,220
It wasn't long ago when
there were rumors about exiling Bingung.

304
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,300
Now, there are rumors about dethroning the Crown Prince.

305
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,470
What should be done...

306
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,710
The calls for demolishing of
the royal family are getting higher now.

307
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,970
Father, for a democratic country...

308
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,610
The calls to end the reign of
the royal family is always there.

309
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,750
So please don't worry too much.

310
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,830
But this is not something normal.

311
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,720
We cannot sit and do nothing about it.

312
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,950
Hwang sang King, what do you you think?

313
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,400
Now, the royals are in the midst of chaos.

314
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,310
The Crown Prince, Bingung and Yul Sung Dae Goon...

315
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,340
don't have any peaceful days.

316
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,200
So, I came up with a temporary strategy.

317
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,850
Temporary strategy?

318
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,720
Let Bingung hide away overseas temporarily.

319
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,140
I also think this way.

320
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,240
To cover Bingung's scandal.

321
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,860
If this goes on,
the citizens anger will build up as days go by.

322
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,440
The citizens need to see that
Bingung is reflecting over her mistakes.

323
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,100
This cannot be done.

324
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
Umma Mama.

325
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,560
I can understand the Crown Prince's heart.

326
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,320
But the existence of the royal family is at stake.

327
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,050
We need someone to make a sacrifice.

328
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,520
Even if you say as my parents...

329
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,520
I cannot accept this.

330
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,830
Perhaps this is too much towards Bingung.

331
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,720
But what is most important is to save the royal family.

332
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:51,000
Shin, compared to feelings,
the royal family is more important.

333
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,540
Whether Bingung should go and stay, it's up to me.

334
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,560
So it's my decision.

335
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,990
Shin, where did you return from?

336
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,330
Listen carefully to my words.

337
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,090
What's wrong?

338
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,190
No matter what happens in the future,

339
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,770
Trust me, listen to me.

340
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,460
I know.

341
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,890
But what happened?

342
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,220
And one more thing,

343
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,110
Regardless of what you hear...

344
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,550
Don't be sad without my permission.

345
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,910
Promise?

346
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,990
I promise.

347
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,930
Without Shin Goon's permission, I won't be sad.

348
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,530
Now, you are giving up your freedom already?

349
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,370
Not giving up.

350
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,300
Just starting fresh.

351
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,510
I want to learn how to live in the palace...

352
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,330
Not running away but facing the problems.

353
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,030
Fight along with Shin Goon.

354
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,480
Wah. You are so cool. Totally romantic.

355
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,610
Totally like the ending for Cinderella story.

356
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,500
Oh. They are here again.

357
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,330
Swan, hello.

358
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,460
Is this an amusement park?

359
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,990
Even when you reject someone, you still look cute.

360
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,020
Crazy. I'm going crazy...

361
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,680
Before that love of yours disappear,

362
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,040
I guess we have to report here everyday.

363
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,340
But, is Shin okay?

364
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,080
Why are you all worried about Shin?

365
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
We are Shin's friends.

366
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Pass this message to Shin, ask him to fight on.

367
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,280
And also, Bingung Mama...

368
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,930
You, I say...

369
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,680
Don't be too worried about
the rumors about the exiling, fight till the end.

370
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,240
Re-read the comic again,
the ugly duckling is actually a swan.

371
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,490
You realize it now? You rice bucket.

372
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,610
Anyways, fight till the end. If there is any need...

373
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,570
Just say so.

374
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,690
There is the three of us.

375
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,370
Understand?

376
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,190
Why do I feel like crying?

377
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,400
Friends are really, afterall, friends.

378
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,060
Shin Goon and I will strive hard and we won't give up.

379
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,010
So. It's prepared.

380
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,860
There shouldn't be any other problems.

381
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,310
I know. I will take note.

382
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,430
So basically just don't speak unnecessarily right?

383
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,270
Yes. Mama.

384
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,900
After the investigation, you will be back right?

385
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,180
Still pretending to be brave, I just realize you are timid.

386
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,450
I am worried. So tell me.

387
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,410
After the investigation, you will be back right?

388
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,100
Oy.

389
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,800
So you think I'm leaving the earth?

390
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,950
We are not going to be apart.

391
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,610
Please step aside for a while.

392
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,770
Yes, Jeonha.

393
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,850
Everything was a trap set up by Tae-Hu Mama?

394
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,560
Planning such a perfect crime, surely it was hard.

395
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,600
It wasn't mine from the start.

396
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,590
So I always thought that I will return
the position to you in the end.

397
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,360
What do you mean?

398
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,680
But after suffering from such an attack,

399
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,360
a disgusting feeling came from deep in my heart.

400
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,390
Don't think that you know everything.

401
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,280
I told you before that I will give up
the position as the Crown Prince right?

402
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,510
What's yours you can take it away.

403
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,330
But you...

404
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,950
Do not have the right to Chaegyung.

405
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,280
Speaking of rights, you don't have it either.

406
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm not sure what is your way of loving someone, but...

407
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,350
Your selfish love...

408
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,290
Will only cause Chaegyung to leave here in the end.

409
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,050
Open your eyes and look carefully.

410
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,440
This is the ending point of your love.

411
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,120
Shin Goon, it just ended now?

412
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,300
No.

413
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,980
It ended for quite sometime already.

414
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,640
How was it?

415
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,290
There is no sufficient evidence, they can't do anything.

416
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,950
That's a relief.

417
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,160
So, you came over so late in the night, just to tell me this?

418
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,920
I am asking you...

419
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,240
You came over to tell me this?

420
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,150
I m-missed you.

421
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,450
If I don't see you now, I'm afraid I will suffocate.

422
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,150
Can you say it one more time?

423
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,500
I missed you.

424
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,290
Even if I am seeing you now, I still miss you.

425
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,580
This is how it should be.

426
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,670
You say it out from the start.

427
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,260
In the future, every single thing, every single second,

428
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,460
Tell me how your heart truly feel,
I will be contented like that,

429
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,510
Are you playing with me again?

430
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,140
This time it's for real.

431
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,210
Really?

432
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,780
You ruin the whole atmosphere.

433
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,360
Can't you bear with it for a little while?

434
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,410
It's not as if I can control it.

435
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,090
Most probably I got shocked by Shin Goon.

436
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,290
You try to shock me again.

437
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,240
It will only stop then.

438
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,750
I cannot do it.

439
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,790
Say some ghost stories.

440
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,350
I say I cannot do it.

441
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,030
What to do...

442
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,910
You, hiccupping like this.. isn't this too exaggerating.

443
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,140
Going to hiccup till morning?!!!!!

444
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,860
Ah I don't know. If you're not helping, just go.

445
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,400
I am helping you now right?!

446
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,600
You think by doing that it'll stop the hiccups?

447
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,850
-Did it stop?
-Did it stop?

448
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,940
Going overseas?

449
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,150
What does that mean?

450
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,160
Now, the royal family is in a very difficult position.

451
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,140
We do not have other choices.

452
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,180
You also saw that report right?

453
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,290
The topic of exiling of the Crown Princess
will be more fired up in the future.

454
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,790
That means that me leaving
the palace will help the royal family right?

455
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:43,200
Looking at current situation, there is no other choice.

456
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,350
Bingung.

457
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,660
We all feel guilty towards young Bingung.

458
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,290
But if this drags on,
the future of the royal family seems bleak.

459
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,700
Please say yes.

460
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:09,450
Can't I leave after the Crown Prince's problem is solved?

461
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,170
Do I have to leave now?

462
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,820
Is that really true?

463
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,500
What did Chaegyung do wrong
to have them send her away?

464
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,690
They really know how to use their heads.

465
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,040
Using Bingung as a sacrifice...

466
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,660
Trying to get sympathy votes regarding the issues about the dethroning of the Crown Prince?

467
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,130
Getting out of my hands is not that easy.

468
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,670
Mom. Enough.

469
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,040
If you become king,
that child will not be able to live together with you.

470
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,970
Stop saying it! Enough!!

471
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,980
If mom continues like this,

472
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,870
I don't know what kind of things I will do.

473
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,320
I will solve this. You stay here.

474
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,320
Shin Goon. Don't be like this.

475
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,600
They say they will respect my decision.

476
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,500
You think this is a choice?!

477
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,390
This is a violent act by the royal family!

478
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,690
It's my choice.

479
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,030
What?

480
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,330
Don't tell me...

481
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,340
This is the best for the royal family and Shin Goon.

482
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,260
So I decide to go.

483
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,240
Don't joke.

484
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,230
When I entered the palace, it was my choice.

485
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,850
So to leave will also be my choice.

486
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,870
Not because of anyone chasing me out.

487
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,260
It is my own choice.
Being responsible of my decision.

488
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,730
Didn't we say we won't be apart?

489
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,320
It is not breaking up.

490
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,150
I am just away temporary for a holiday.

491
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,060
Just take it as winter holidays.

492
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,630
If this is for the royal family, you don't have to do this.

493
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,540
What more important is your life.

494
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,800
Protecting family is also my life.

495
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,730
The royal family is my family.

496
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,970
Asking you to go overseas, it's all because of me.

497
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,850
If I say I want to leave the palace,
the elders will change their minds.

498
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,540
It's not because of Yul Goon.

499
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,910
For the sake of everyone, this is the best way.

500
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,660
But this is not your fault.

501
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:27,050
If Shin Goon is worried for me now, he will be even more tired.

502
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,980
So in the end, it all still be because of Shin.

503
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,010
I can do anything for Shin Goon.

504
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,930
But...

505
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,340
My heart hurts a lot.

506
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,630
If you didn't enter the palace,

507
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,560
Or if I didn't return,

508
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,460
Will the three of us be happier?

509
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:05,820
Even if it hurts, I am still thankful that I met Shin Goon.

510
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,710
What I wish for...

511
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,860
Seems so significant.

512
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,360
I wish that even if I am a farmer,

513
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,530
I can still see your sun like smile.

514
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,530
But I guess to me, these are all wishful thinking.

515
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,980
From the start, nothing belonged to me.

516
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,360
It is time for Seo Sang Gong to appear.

517
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,620
Are you prepared?

518
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,360
Yes. Tae-Hu Mama.

519
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,530
I am an eagle.

520
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,190
After living half of its life...

521
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,650
to prepare for its later half,

522
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,560
it will do countless hunts, removing old feathers.

523
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,090
After shedding off the past,

524
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:21,410
it will then be able to soar the skies and owns it.

525
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,270
In the period of the past 14 years,

526
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,790
I reshuffled my life as well.

527
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,640
Waiting for this day to arrive.

528
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,380
It is time to end this.

529
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,580
I made a grave mistake a few decades ago,

530
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:50,120
And almost cost the life of then young King Hyo Ryul (Yul's dad).

531
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,730
But King Hyo Ryul forgave me.

532
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,090
This is why I could live in the palace till now.

533
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,050
Is it?

534
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,290
It is said that for the act of forgiving,

535
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,290
mistakes should be written on sand.

536
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,290
Repaying of debts should be engraved on stones.

537
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:14,150
And for me, it is engraved on my old bones.

538
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,720
Now, I can use my useless life to repay my debts.

539
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,030
I feel honored and more honored that I can.

540
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,570
Pig's going overseas,
what has that got to do with saving the royal family?

541
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,010
This is ridiculous!

542
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,150
Absolutely not.

543
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,570
I've already decided.

544
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,180
-No!
-No!

545
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,700
Who allowed you to go?

546
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,400
You are my daughter.

547
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,120
Chaegyung. Don't be like this.

548
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,060
Can't you pretend to go overseas and come home?

549
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,070
I can't lie to the citizens.

550
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,980
For the royal family, for Shin Goon, this is the best way.

551
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,700
So I hope you all let me go.

552
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,900
So, you have already set your heart to it right?

553
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,700
Chaegyung.

554
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,100
I am now, the country's Crown Princess.

555
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,400
I want to fulfill all the responsibilities and job as a Crown Princess.

556
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,330
Why do I feel like pig is a totally changed person?

557
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,490
Always thought that our Princess is just a kid,

558
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,260
so you are all grown up already.

559
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,300
Even if we ask you not to go, you will still go right?

560
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,640
So, please support my decision.

561
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,980
You did well.

562
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,370
Our Princess is great.

563
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,630
Yes. You did well Chaegyung.

564
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,190
Yes, Pig. You did so well.

565
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,710
Bring me along.

566
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,300
Gong Nae Gwan Ajusshi.

567
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,760
Just this once please.

568
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,360
Bingung Mama.

569
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:42,160
In these circumstances, the Crown Prince cannot go out.

570
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:49,420
This could be the last time for me
to be together with Shin Goon.

571
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,440
Ahjussi, it's 500 won right?

572
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,330
Why did you bring me out?

573
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,580
I want to show you the world I used to live in.

574
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,940
Why all of the sudden?

575
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,390
What if the winter holidays got too long?

576
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,050
Then I am afraid I won't be able to show you.

577
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,040
Scared me.

578
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:33,010
Even if it's for a short while, I still want to give you
the things you lost as Crown Prince, Lee Shin.

579
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,670
But because I am the Crown Prince, I found you.

580
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,650
Don't try it.

581
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,430
I wore it. I wore it.

582
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:50,730
How?

583
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,490
Really?

584
00:54:52,850 --> 00:55:01,200
Even if you disappear from my side,
I won't ever forget this day.

585
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,230
I will also remember this day forever.

586
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:24,040
Can I ask how much do you like me?

587
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,940
What kind of girl are you to ask such a question so bluntly?

588
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,930
I want to remember this forever.

589
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,310
You really want to know?

590
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,160
Yes.

591
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,930
You shine so much that I can't even look at you.

592
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,270
And because of you, I was able to know the real world.

593
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,750
Congratulations on your solar conquest.

594
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,230
The Crown Prince is still not clear of being a suspect.

595
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,030
Perhaps I can't come back after a long time.

596
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,850
My father, please take care of him.

597
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,230
If I send you,

598
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,230
Perhaps I can't let you go.

599
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:51,270
Perhaps, I'd make you wait for me for the rest of your life.

600
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,320
"Cursed fates will be returned by cursed fates."
It's time to return now.

601
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,670
Now I know...

602
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,120
Why did I fall in love with Chaegyung.

603
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:05,150
And why I couldn't get her.

604
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,560
It's all decided by the heavens above.

605
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,950
Bingung.

606
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,930
Call me Mother.

607
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,770
Mother-in-law is also mother.

608
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,440
Shin Chaegyung.

609
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,000
Among the people I have met...

610
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,760
Is the brightest amongst them all.
