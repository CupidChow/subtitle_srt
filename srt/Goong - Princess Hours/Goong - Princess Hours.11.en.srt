00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,100
Episode 11

2
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,150
What are we going to do from now on?

3
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,400
What are we going to do?

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,560
Everything must be done according
to the Laws and regulations..

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,480
Those people don't they like
the Laws and regulations a lot?

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,110
All the other princes besides
the Crown Prince must stay outside the palace.

7
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,250
Isn't that their Laws and regulations?

8
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,700
Then let's go according to Laws and
regulations for the Chu Jeon..

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,100
Don't you think so?

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,150
Since the regulations are that way,
we'll just have to follow it.

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,890
This is only the beginning.

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,430
For 14 years

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,950
the anger and disdain that I felt...

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,980
I'm going to return these to them several times more..

15
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,100
Just wait and see.

16
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,050
Mama!

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,770
You cannot do this!

18
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,000
You must get permission from
the horse riding instructor first..

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,890
You said that she's on a vacation.

20
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,750
How can I wait until next week?

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,480
Mama, this is dangerous!

22
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,000
If you do that and get hurt---

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,460
Don't worry.

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,810
Today, I'm going to just pet it and walk with it.

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,100
Right?

26
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,470
You're so well behaved!

27
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,860
My name is Shin Chaegyung.

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,840
Hi!

29
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,030
You're so well behaved!

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,150
Mama!

31
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,650
Mama!

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,330
Mama!

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,100
You cannot do this!

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,810
You know how when you watch Western movies

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,920
the main character does this.

36
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
Excuse me!

37
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,590
Excuse me!

38
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,050
Please move!!

39
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,050
Are you alright?

40
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,100
Did you get hurt?

41
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,790
But, unnie..

42
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,420
which palace's Sang Gong unnie are you?

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,430
are you allowed to wear those kinds of
clothes in the palace as well?

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,150
GongJu mama.

45
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,840
Princess HaeMyung!

46
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,900
How have you been?

47
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,330
Thank you, Mama!

48
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,440
Tada!

49
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
Isn't it pretty?

50
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,150
This is for you..

51
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,200
Thanks, Mama..

52
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,620
UNICEF.. The green colored Peace organization..

53
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,100
The World youth volunteer association..

54
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,000
What else?

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,620
If we count up all the welfare activities
you've done for the whole of last year..

56
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm afraid that even all my
10 fingers aren't enough to use..

57
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,470
We thought you have forgot about your palace's life
since you are busily traveling the world.

58
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,200
Then..

59
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,070
Gongju mama..

60
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,590
Were you "protecting" the world during that period of time?

61
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,950
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,340
Go ahead and continue with what you were saying.

64
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,050
Noona!

65
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,330
Shin Goon!

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,940
What happened to your hair?

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,150
Does it look bad?

68
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,990
No it looks very good on you!
You look very cool!

69
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,880
How was it throughout a year?

70
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,150
Tell me about it..

71
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,400
The world's most boring thing is to listen
to another person's travel stories.

72
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,150
I'm more curious about you two.

73
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,620
How's life in the palace?

74
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,770
It's more tedious than you thought, huh?

75
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,900
At first it was a bit hard, now it's--

76
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,170
Gongju Mama.
Gongju Mama!

77
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,450
Time went by so quickly already.

78
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,020
Halmama must be waiting.

79
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,170
Yeah, let's go.

80
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,910
Oh, wait.

81
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,340
If you report everything in details to
Halmamama it's going to be very boring.

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,760
I'll be back.

83
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,860
He's completely a new stranger..

84
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,830
Like a total different person.

85
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,260
There are more than 16,000,000 Orphans
in the north side of the Sahara.

86
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,570
Poverty and war which often re-occured has brought them fear and un-peacefulness.

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,580
Although I don't need to say these.

88
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,780
But compared to others,
these hungry children who begged for survival.

89
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,700
It's really a sight that I couldn't bear to see.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,970
One side is having trouble over the overweight issue.

91
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,870
And the other side have to bear with poverty.

92
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,690
This world is really unfair.

93
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,000
Halmamama had told us this before.

94
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,280
Poverty is what even the king can't resolve and you say that it needs to be change.

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,100
Don't you remember?

96
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,480
Do you still remember it?

97
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,400
Of course.

98
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,630
It was when we were young.

99
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,110
For some reason,

100
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,470
that time when you told me that,
it won't leave my mind.

101
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,100
Isn't that funny?

102
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,190
I wasn't even 10 years old.

103
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,530
Then, you need to work even harder
and give out even more.

104
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,440
It's like sitting here like a fool while putting up the fake hair.

105
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,590
It will only waste your life away.

106
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,680
Then, Halmamama...

107
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,880
you should change your hair style like my sister.

108
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,870
Should I?

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Halmamama.

110
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,500
then should we take a picture together?

111
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,580
Look here.

112
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,600
One

113
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,730
two..

114
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
Wait, look where?

115
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Over here.

116
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,250
One.

117
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,170
Two.

118
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,370
Three!

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,170
Kimchi.

120
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,620
Mama, Hwang-hu Mama has arrived.

121
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,970
Your mother will be worried,
so don't tell her about your trip to Africa.

122
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,270
Okay.

123
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,990
What happened to your hair?

124
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,870
And your outfit?

125
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,450
You worried a lot because of me, right? Mother?

126
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,700
Mother? What do you mean?

127
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,100
Gongju!

128
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,380
Don't say anything.

129
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,790
I have wanted to hug you like this..

130
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Mother.

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
So far...

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,200
these two guys, Kim Hee Yeon and Park Hee Yeon,
has helped us greatly.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,860
Yes, I know.

134
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,890
I was planning on meeting them to say thank you.

135
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,420
I'm glad that we're meeting like this.

136
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,640
Thank you.

137
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,780
No.

138
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,120
Prince Hyo Ryul is not just anybody.

139
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,440
Apart from us being school mates,
it is a mandatory chance to be helping you.

140
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,220
If you want to recover Hyo Ryul's name sake...

141
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,770
We'll have to help the Crown prince's wife and son get back their original position.

142
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,880
What we have to do is still a lot more.

143
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm not the HwangTaeJaBi Mama.

144
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,670
Please don't call me that from now on.

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,570
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,000
You're our eternal HwangTaeJaBi Mama.

147
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,190
Now, you must get ready to become the Great Queen.

148
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,590
Go ahead first.

149
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,000
I will go with Senator Kim when he comes out.

150
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,950
I heard that the prince has returned?

151
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,850
Yes.

152
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,760
In fact, I was going to show you something.

153
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,070
Pyeha, are you unable to sleep?

154
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,710
If you don't sleep like this every night, because of worries...

155
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,200
You have fallen sick because you had overwork.

156
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,390
Whenever I think about my brother who passed away,

157
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,770
my heart feels heavy and frustrated.

158
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,550
Every year when Crown prince
Hyo Ryul's Death anniversary approaches,

159
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,950
You'll be more sensitive.

160
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,860
If only I didn't cause that accident...

161
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,020
My brother has died because of me... because of me.

162
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,530
There was nothing you could have done about that accident.

163
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,810
It is not your fault.

164
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,430
Why are you still blaming yourself for such a long time?

165
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,930
I'm the younger brother who couldn't protect my brother's family from being chase out of the palace.

166
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,410
This wasn't your intention, too.

167
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,280
Everything was done according to the Royal family's laws and the former king's instructions.

168
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,550
Maybe it's long fated that the Chu Jeon had to be done.

169
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,670
Although you are in King's position...

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,180
You have always held your late brother as the king in your heart.

171
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:51,820
As time passed by, I have watched over the pain you were feeling.

172
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,580
Your pain was my pain.

173
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,450
I won't oppose the Chu Jeon.

174
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:11,770
If it will make the burden in your heart a bit lighter, I'll do it.

175
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,720
Knock, knock.

176
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,080
What are you doing, Shin Goon?

177
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,720
Today's a bit cold, huh?

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,780
Even though I ate some medicine for cold, it's too cold.

179
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,230
Your room's warm, unlike you.

180
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,130
Did you come to spread your cold?

181
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,670
How could you say something like that?

182
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,540
Want to get in?

183
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,410
What?!

184
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,210
Acting like you're surprised?

185
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,140
We've been in the same bed for a few days. why are you still pretending to be shy?

186
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,140
This has coal stones mattress under it, so it's warm.

187
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,990
But still!

188
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,130
Then, let me be impolite for once?

189
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,840
Excuse me.

190
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,490
This is so warm!

191
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,210
This is good.

192
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,780
But...

193
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
I heard this somewhere...

194
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,800
but was I supposed to get married to Yul?

195
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,810
Grandfather's promise was to arrange a marriage with you and the next prince to be king.

196
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,170
The crown grandson wasn't me but Yul at that time.

197
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,570
You were only his future wife for a period of time.

198
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,790
I see.

199
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:01,260
After hearing that, I'm a bit embarrassed to face him.

200
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,890
Why? Are you regretting now?

201
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,490
If it's so regretful, why don't you just...

202
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,640
What are you doing instead of sleeping?

203
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,120
All of you back down.

204
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,240
What are you doing?

205
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,430
It's not like that...

206
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,530
What do you mean, what are we doing?

207
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,240
This place is the eastern palace,

208
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,700
how could you barge in like that
to our personal place as you wish?

209
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,440
Even if you are the Queen,
shouldn't you have some manners to keep?

210
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,960
And we didn't do what you thought we were doing,
so don't worry.

211
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,980
All I was doing was keeping her warm.

212
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,650
Do you think you have the right to yell at me ?

213
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,180
Go outside for a moment, Bigung.

214
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,640
Yes!

215
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,690
What do you have to say to me?

216
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,100
This is the gossip newspaper of Thailand.

217
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,690
Is what the news reported true?

218
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,430
Why have you done this!?

219
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,660
This is the time when everyone's
watching over your every single move.

220
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,320
How could you have done something like this?

221
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,620
Seja, please come to the Hwang Gong and do your explaining.

222
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,430
What's wrong with her?

223
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,110
Why did she do that?

224
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,360
What report came out?

225
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,830
What is this?

226
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,150
Were you two in Thailand together?

227
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,790
This isn't true, right?

228
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,130
Do I need to tell you everything?

229
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm just curious.

230
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,710
You don't need to know.

231
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,510
What?

232
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,470
I can't ask you questions like these?

233
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,330
So I don't have the right to ask?

234
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,390
You don't have to worry about this.

235
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,550
Take care of your health instead of trying to find out silly stuff.

236
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,610
You don't have to worry if I'm sick or not.

237
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,630
I'm very healthy.

238
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,920
So don't be concerned.

239
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,070
You're healthy you said?!?

240
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,020
Do you know how you made everyone worried???

241
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,100
What's the problem?!

242
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,400
What is so wrong that you can't even eat properly!?!

243
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,120
You don't need to know why I'm suffering.

244
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,150
What?!

245
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,100
You don't even let me ask you about this picture.

246
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,080
So, don't matter whether I die from starvation or not.

247
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,250
Shin Chaegyung! You!

248
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,650
I'm so stupid.

249
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,930
Without knowing that you were having fun with Hyorin,

250
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,250
I...

251
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,750
I was waiting for you, not being able to sleep.

252
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,320
I feel really stupid.

253
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,610
Did this really come out in the newspaper?

254
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,290
Why are you so surprised?

255
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,170
Were you thinking that I was doing yoga peacefully?

256
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,920
What are you going to do?

257
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,000
Do what?

258
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,420
Something will happen.

259
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,290
Is the prince allowed to do that?

260
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,480
Since when did this happen?

261
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:48,860
what?

262
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Special news.

263
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,420
What's this?

264
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,080
The picture of Shin Goon and Hyorin in Thailand...

265
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,380
Has already became the people's
most talk-about topic for many days.

266
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
The news just spread more far and wide.

267
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,380
And slowly, there were rumors about me
and Shin Goon on bad terms.

268
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,350
In the end,
the Royal family was left facing a difficult situation.

269
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,610
Hi.

270
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,460
Hi.

271
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,310
What's going on?

272
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,100
Shin Chaegyung.

273
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,400
Are you alright?

274
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,370
What?

275
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,340
About the Prince and Min Hyorin.

276
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,590
They're just friends.

277
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,150
That girl was the one who tried to seduce him first.

278
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,820
That's right, although she said she met him by coincidence in overseas.

279
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,850
You should have met him in private when that guy is a Prince.

280
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,670
What's wrong with your face?

281
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,270
I'm tired and I haven't eaten.

282
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,490
Your relationship with him... it's okay, right?

283
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,790
Was there ever a time when we had a good relationship?

284
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,590
Hi.

285
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,460
Hi.

286
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,690
Hey...

287
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,420
Do you want to talk with me?

288
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,810
Something bad has happened!

289
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,660
Our Princess has offered to have a battle with Min Hyorin.

290
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,510
Are you not going?

291
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,510
Big news!

292
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,830
Right now there's a big match between
Shin Chaegyung and Min Hyorin.

293
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,610
What?

294
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,890
Aren't you going?

295
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,180
Aren't you supposed to stop them?

296
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,920
No thanks.

297
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,490
Let's go.

298
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,850
You must be in such a bad position.

299
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,240
Aren't your parents saying something about this?

300
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,310
You just met him while you went there.

301
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,010
Everybody has been spreading exaggerated rumors, so...

302
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,070
Hold on!
Everybody has been spreading exaggerated rumors, so...

303
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,020
Hold on!

304
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,300
Wait!

305
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,030
We will protect the Princess!

306
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,970
Were you the one who tried to seduce the prince?

307
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,770
You're too weak to win!

308
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,880
Leave it to us!

309
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,060
Sorry.

310
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,790
I think my friends misunderstood.

311
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,800
So anyways, what I'm trying to say is that,

312
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,590
while you were on your way...

313
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,170
Your "coincidence" theory is incorrect.

314
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,180
I went to Thailand to meet Shin, purposely.

315
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,780
In Korea, you both husband and wife are always together, so I can't say whatever I wanted to say.

316
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,290
There's a lot of things I want to say to him
but after the marriage, it became rather difficult.

317
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
But we're the ones who got married first.

318
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,400
You might be the one who obtained the marriage first, but the one who first received a proposal and was liked...

319
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,530
It's me, Min Hyorin.

320
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,670
Since it's already like that,
why are you saying this now?

321
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,780
Because I don't want to be known as the old Min Hyorin.

322
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,050
Like a fool, I lost my love.
Things like these, it's enough for it to happen once.

323
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know how well you two get along

324
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,780
but it seems that he embraces my presence pretty well.

325
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,730
What did you say?

326
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,970
Saying these things in front of you
makes me feel like a mistress.

327
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,000
What? How can you phrase it like that?

328
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,850
What're you talking about?

329
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:16,550
I am not interested in the position of the Crown Princess. To me, I am contented if I have Shin.

330
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,850
This is weird. Why is everything so blurry?

331
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,320
Sorry.

332
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,320
Let's talk some other time...

333
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,720
Now.. my body....

334
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,400
Chaegyung. Chaegyung....

335
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,300
Chaegyung, are you okay?

336
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,070
Chaegyung. Chaegyung....

337
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,480
Chaegyung. Chaegyung, are you okay?

338
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,510
Move over.

339
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,850
Isn't she putting up a show?

340
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,760
How is it?

341
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,600
How is it like to be infamous?

342
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:24,840
The title of the "Crown Prince's girlfriend" is really huge, I am experiencing it now.

343
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,110
Do you have to say those things to Chaegyung?

344
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,180
I caused the cousin-in-law,
whom you are in love with to faint.

345
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,320
I think you must be hating me right?

346
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,060
Don't hurt Chaegyung.

347
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,330
You are not going to thank me?

348
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,400
What?

349
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,310
If such things were to happen more often, it is easier for you to become the Crown Prince.

350
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,200
Isn't that what you want?

351
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,980
I don't what to get it  by using these methods.

352
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,280
I will do things my own way in the future.

353
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,890
Shin didn't even spare me a glance just now.

354
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,160
I feel that he didn't even see me there.

355
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,660
I feel so insecure.

356
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,030
Whatever it is, you will get what you want.

357
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,170
How is she?

358
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,780
The fever went down a little.

359
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,380
She is sleeping now.

360
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,920
Then want to have a chat with me?

361
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,870
You don't have to worry too much
about the pictures in the newspapers.

362
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,480
Mother and the Imperial Officer will handle it.

363
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,810
You can gain a lot of experience from this incident.

364
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,120
When I got the news that you got married,
I thought you married that woman.

365
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,960
I proposed.

366
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,430
Then?

367
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,260
I got rejected.

368
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,030
What? Really?

369
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,870
The Crown Prince Lee Shin got rejected?

370
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,810
I didn't even say much and I got rejected already.

371
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,280
But I thank her.

372
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,610
What?

373
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,280
I wouldn't want someone I like to live the boring life I have.

374
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:25,120
Hyorin thinks a lot and she wants a lot as well, so she can't be a puppet in the palace.

375
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,120
Then what about Chaegyung?

376
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,560
At first, I thought she will be all right.

377
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,100
But it seems that it is not like that.

378
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,430
She was born not to have the ability
to become a puppet of the palace.

379
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,770
Is it?

380
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:46,580
Things that are boring and tiring to me,
Chaegyung will feel that they are fascinating.

381
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,150
From what I see,
it's is not that she is getting used to the palace,

382
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,280
But the palace is getting used to her.

383
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,420
That's why she can't be a puppet of the palace.

384
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,990
Is it so?

385
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,990
Whatever it is, that is really exceptional.

386
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,060
Yes, she is an exceptional girl.

387
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,430
What's that...

388
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,170
Are you liking her already?

389
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,710
What are you talking about.
It's a political marriage.

390
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:25,910
Two people who are not in love got married, but does it mean that they won't have love, forever?

391
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,360
I traveled all over the world for the past 2 years.
I felt a lot and I learn a lot.

392
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
To people, love is still the most important thing.

393
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,630
There are many different ways of expressing love but to people, the most important thing...

394
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,870
It's still love.

395
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,840
Our Shin, will also come to accept a love like this, right?

396
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,510
Oi. You sound like a priest.

397
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,810
A priest?

398
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,520
A priest is not bad either.

399
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,330
Sorry for letting you wait for so long.

400
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,330
BigungMama just had a medications and she fell asleep. She is not awake yet.

401
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,870
And Seja Jeonha is not around either.

402
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,910
I will wait.

403
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,740
Yes.

404
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,090
Comparing to Seja Jeonha,
Hwi Sung Gong Mama is better looking right?

405
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,830
Say something...

406
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,330
It hurts.

407
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,000
Rub it for me.

408
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,470
Mom, Mom...

409
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,320
Yul Goon?

410
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,670
How did you get in here?

411
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,840
I am here to visit the sick.

412
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:12,850
This is a mint plant called apple mint,
it's very good for colds.

413
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,630
It smells great.

414
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,660
Are you feeling better?

415
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Yul Goon is the only one who cares for me, thank you.

416
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,750
It's so stuffy, I want to get some fresh air.

417
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,820
It feels like I'm alive again.

418
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,660
That's good.

419
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,030
Staying in bed all day makes me feel like I am even weaker.

420
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,270
Aja Aja, be strong.

421
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,170
Don't get sick in the future.

422
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,540
When you are sick, I feel the pain too.

423
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,020
You're here?

424
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,390
What is the sick person doing sitting out here?

425
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,160
Hey, Shin Goon.
Who caused me to be sick in the first place?

426
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,300
It's only my bad luck that I am with you.
You didn't even come to see me...

427
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,600
Shut up, who do you think carried you back to the palace?

428
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,750
Do you know how heavy you are?

429
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,200
Go shed some of that weight off when you have the time.

430
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,980
You really carried me back?

431
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,910
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

432
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,520
Get in the house quick.

433
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,420
Why?

434
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,130
The medication is ready, drink it,
be obedient and go back to sleep.

435
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,830
You hurt here and there, it's really troublesome.

436
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,170
Hey! How can you chase someone away like this... hey.

437
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,140
The moment you heard that BigungMama is ill, you rushed here?

438
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,510
When did you get here?

439
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,350
Let's play together.

440
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,120
Let me tag along...

441
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,860
Or do you guys have some secret?

442
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,630
My mouth is really tight...

443
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,530
Ow. My head.. OW.. the door...

444
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,370
Go in!

445
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,210
I don't think that she's sick enough for you to be visiting.

446
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,480
She may look strong on the surface
but she misses her mom.

447
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,350
She was calling for her mom in her sleep.

448
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,720
It seems that you heart is already stamped with the impression.

449
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,390
"She became like that because I have been mistreating her?"

450
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,890
Why? Does that really trouble you?

451
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,000
Anyways, if you really worried for her till this state,

452
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,700
you shouldn't let her stay here in the cold, but get her back in the house quickly.

453
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,690
The younger brother mourning for the older brother. This has never happened before.

454
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,630
How do we settle this?

455
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,830
Hye Jung Gong, what do you think about this?

456
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,110
This topic is too sudden.

457
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,510
I had buried him deep in my heart 14 years ago.

458
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,250
That's right.

459
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,390
But there is one thing..

460
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,560
As time goes by, he is being forgotten by the people.

461
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,030
My heart hurts because of that.

462
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,100
That's true.

463
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:04,870
What the King wanted was to proceed with the "Chu Jeon" ceremony as soon as possible.

464
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,000
But the problem lies in after the ceremony end,

465
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,710
the change in the ranking of
Hye Jung Gong and Hwi Sung Goon's status.

466
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,950
Will bring in lots of headaches..

467
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,760
I really don't know much about politics.

468
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,700
But I know that you had never forgotten
about us and you still remember us.

469
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,630
I'm really thankful.

470
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:44,550
The part to convince the dowager, please leave it to me.

471
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,150
Thank you, Nanny.
Really, thank you.

472
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,890
There's no need to thank me, this is what I should do.

473
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:02,930
There are still people in the palace
who miss the decreased Crown Prince.

474
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,140
If he were to become king, he would have been a great king.

475
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,920
Please forgive me for my words.

476
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:30,930
14 years ago, Hye Jung Gong Mama followed rules of the palace, and gave up the title of the Crown Princess.

477
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,260
And left the palace with the then
young Hwi Sung Goon Mama.

478
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:39,970
Yes. It was like that.

479
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,970
It was unfortunate at that time.

480
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,050
Why was the Past King so unsympathetic and cold?

481
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,350
I didn't even have any say in that matter.

482
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,290
Yes, Mama.
It was like that.

483
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:04,760
How can the Past King make the decision just like that in that kind of circumstances?

484
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,930
Between 2 sons, daughter-in-laws and the grandchildren

485
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:14,770
I really do not know what to do.

486
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:21,880
Mama.
The Past King is no longer here.

487
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,450
What do you mean by that?

488
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:32,450
Mama, I am trying to say that you have the highest authority now.

489
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,000
That's right.

490
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:49,840
If this carries on, the conflicts will only increase and cause hurts to both parties involved.

491
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:59,400
Before that happens, the dowager who has the highest authority, should make a decision.

492
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:04,920
That is the only way to have peace back in the Imperial Family.

493
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
Consequences?

494
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:21,070
The answer is in your heart, Mama.

495
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,750
The answer is in my heart...

496
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,200
Are you awake?

497
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,770
How are you feeling?

498
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,020
Do you feel like eating anything?

499
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,720
No.

500
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,630
What do I have to do to make you eat?

501
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,360
What do I have to do...

502
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,540
- Mom!
- Chaegyung!

503
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,270
How did you become like this?
My child. My child.

504
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,840
I missed you so much.

505
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,850
When we heard that you fainted, we were so scared.

506
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,220
I heard that you do not have appetite
and you are not eating well.

507
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
- Why?
- Chaejoon is not here?

508
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,860
He is working out, he went out with his friends.

509
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,800
Why didn't you come and visit me at all?
I miss mom and dad a lot!

510
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,030
Our Princess, why is your face so swollen?

511
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,170
Compared to the past, she slimmed down a lot.

512
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,170
No, her face is swollen.

513
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,940
I will leave the room temporarily.

514
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,950
Yes.

515
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,490
Chaegyung. Guess what dad brought you?

516
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,200
What are all these?

517
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,730
Chaegyung's favorite dishes.

518
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,430
There are still more here.

519
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,600
I will grow fat after finishing these.

520
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,440
Once she sees food she forgets everything else.

521
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,080
It's because the food is made by mum and dad.

522
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,210
Of course, of course, eat more.

523
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,110
Dad made these?

524
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,010
Of course.

525
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,150
This is a rare sight in 10 year.

526
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,520
There is still duck liver in there.

527
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,960
Here is the kimchi.

528
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,660
I really want to eat that.

529
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,490
Look at the way she eats.

530
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,530
Okay, eat slowly.
Your mouth is going to explode.

531
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,840
Someone who can eat so much.

532
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,350
About this, son-in-law.

533
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,050
No, I mean.. Jeonha.

534
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:26,960
I think there shouldn't be a problem to allow our Chaegyung to go back home for a short while right?

535
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:33,860
That's right, Jeonha. Getting together with her family will allow her to rest and get well better.

536
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,570
I'm sorry, but I am afraid it can't be done.

537
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,270
She may feel better after coming back from home,

538
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,880
but if she gets sick again like this, then does it mean that she has to go home again?

539
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,920
I am very confused, I need her by my side now.

540
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,290
Jeonha, the Queen has already agreed to this.

541
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,460
Chaegyung is my wife.

542
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,930
We make our own decisions.

543
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:11,400
In palace, we have the best medical technology and people to look after her, so please don't worry too much.

544
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,410
Fu Wang Gong Mama, the Great Queen asks for a meeting with you before you leave.

545
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,890
You may feel that I am very ruthless and cold  but for the future, I will still have to say this...

546
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,560
The guardian now for Chaegyung is
no longer mother and father-in-law.

547
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,130
It's me, your son-in-law.

548
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,910
Halmamama has requested to meet your parents, so they went to see her now.

549
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,360
You bad guy!

550
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,300
Who are you to speak to my parents like that?

551
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,640
They pleaded with you because they care about me.

552
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,640
How can you say such things to them?

553
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,010
Things that cannot be done, it's better to give up earlier.

554
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,250
For someone like you, if you go back once,

555
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,910
you'll be thinking of getting out
when you are having a difficult time again.

556
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,480
That will be only giving me more trouble.

557
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,480
That's why I won't allow it.

558
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,000
Allow?

559
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,190
Why does everything I do has to be approved by you?

560
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,230
Aren't you living the way you want to?

561
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,230
You can meet whoever you want to meet.

562
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,850
Are you asking because you really don't know?

563
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,430
It seems that you have a misunderstanding.

564
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,670
The life in the palace and life outside
the palace are two different world.

565
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,750
Outside the palace, male and female may call for equality but you are living here..

566
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,780
Everything from the architecture to the decorations, are immersed in the midst of tradition.

567
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,850
Whether it so old that rust is falling
or it still needs to be broken,

568
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:12,490
At least here, the deep embedded roots of traditions still remain completely intact.

569
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:17,530
And according to tradition, the wife has to obey the husband completely, understand?

570
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,900
Remember to eat on time.

571
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,440
Such a bad... bad guy.

572
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,870
If I allow you to leave...

573
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,890
you will for sure...

574
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,240
won't be returning here again.

575
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,210
Please don't worry.

576
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,750
Yes, there's nothing much to be worried about..

577
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,980
She's really an active child.

578
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
And this is...?

579
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:22,160
Sorry for the late introduction, this is HaeMyung.

580
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,030
This is the very elegant, Gongju??

581
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,800
Always seeing her name on the TV and newspaper, I always wonder who might it be.

582
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,100
Very glad to meet you.

583
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,410
We are very honored to meet you, Mama.

584
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,040
Yes. This is the first time.

585
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:50,990
Lately, Princess lost her appetite and is not eating well, we are worried for her.

586
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:55,360
Is there anything she likes to eat back at home?

587
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,060
Yes. Of course.

588
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,200
Our Chaegyung...

589
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,330
Her favorite dishes are, spicy rice cakes and pig's blood.
Especially chicken...

590
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,740
I am sorry to say this, Mama.

591
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,640
Yes, please continue.

592
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,340
I feel that the reason for her sickness
did not originate from her body.

593
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,380
But it originated from the loneliness in her heart.

594
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:27,120
Didn't we promise the Queen to keep this from the Dowager?

595
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,000
Yes. That's right.

596
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,500
Our Chaegyung...

597
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,270
No, BigungMama,
the secret to cure her lost of appetite is very simple.

598
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:42,000
As long as she has the spicy rice cakes
and delicious smelling pig's blood.

599
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,410
All these will be enough to increase her appetite.

600
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,950
Please consider my suggestion, Mama.

601
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,060
I feel that the plan is proceeding too fast.

602
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,860
What do you mean?

603
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,660
I am afraid.

604
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,270
I am not mentally prepared yet.

605
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,040
What are you talking about?

606
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,540
You received education on how to become the Crown Prince In England for the past 14 years.

607
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,450
And now you say you are not prepared? What is this?

608
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,280
With just the picture alone, it's enough to remove Shin from the position of the Crown Prince.

609
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:36,560
But I wouldn't be presented with the position of the Crown Prince officially.

610
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,570
To add on, about mom's plans.

611
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,240
What plans of mine?

612
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,370
It's about Hyorin.

613
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,440
The timing is not right yet.

614
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:02,320
Perhaps we could have been able to enter the palace but once this photo is exposed,

615
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,190
Hyorin will be pushed to the limit.

616
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,120
So?

617
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,860
So, everything will have to be pushed back, delayed.

618
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,700
When it is time to remove Shin from the position of the Crown Prince, I will do it personally.

619
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,610
When that day comes, even mom can't stop me.

620
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,280
Our Prince thinks more complicatedly than I do.

621
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,490
Okay, I am glad to see your anticipations.

622
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,290
I always thought I am fighting this battle alone.

623
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,060
Teacher.

624
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,160
Hyorin is here.

625
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,610
Please drink.

626
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,080
Yes.

627
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,180
It has been tough lately right?

628
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,120
I can still handle it.

629
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,820
Didn't the misfortune become something good?
There will be another chance.

630
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,160
Yes.

631
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,230
Oh, yes.

632
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,830
Teacher, congratulations.

633
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,000
What for?

634
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,100
You are moving into the palace soon.

635
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,100
It's still early.

636
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,210
The people are already talking about it, there's no difference from entering the Palace.

637
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,510
Is it?

638
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,010
You are always congratulating me. Thanks.

639
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:42,350
When I move into the palace, come to the palace often. We can drink tea and practice yoga together.

640
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,190
It's my honor to be invited by you,
I've never entered the palace.

641
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,030
Then I will definitely invite you.

642
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,040
No, it's okay, I am almost recovered.

643
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:10,310
Mom's precious daughter Shin Chaegyung is very healthy here. Don't you know?

644
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:17,450
I eat the best food and the best medications but it would be better if you are by my side.

645
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,590
If it was back at home, I would be cured in a day. Here, I have to wait for a least a few days.

646
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,090
Yes.

647
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:27,930
I am good now, really.

648
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,670
Mom, you have to take care of your health too.

649
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,470
I understand.

650
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,380
I am hanging up.

651
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,880
You hang up first.

652
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,960
Oi health nutrient, you look a bit better now.

653
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,570
I heard you asked for your mom in your sleep.

654
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,850
Oi. It's now my turn to hold you as hostage.

655
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,850
Every time you think about going home,
I also wanted to allow you to.

656
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,360
But, the status as a Crown Princess
is much too special so I can't allow it.

657
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,130
It's because I want to secure my position as a Crown Prince.

658
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,700
At least during this period of time, I do not want to go down in history as a useless Crown Prince.

659
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,000
What do you mean?

660
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,470
During this period?

661
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,910
This is going to happen one or two years from now.

662
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,610
What?

663
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:53,620
I will give up the position of the Crown Prince.

664
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:18,610
At that time, it would have been great if the grandchildren played around and had fun.

665
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:26,650
In the past you used to dance and play around in-front of your grandmother. Very obedient.

666
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,020
Don't wait for me.

667
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,620
I can give you nothing.

668
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:41,200
It's okay to just stay where you are.
Just now you are standing beside me now.

669
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,070
Whether I meet shin or not, it's my choice.

670
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,840
If he gets hurt because of me, I do not want that.

671
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:51,270
That's all I want to say.

672
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,340
The new competition begins.

673
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,080
Isn't that a political marriage?

674
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,320
You think too much.

675
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,520
You really should be King.

676
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,260
You treasure everything she gave you.

677
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,500
You treasure it so much.
