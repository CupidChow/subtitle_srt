1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,410
Episode 2

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,200
Hwang-Hu Mama has arrived.

3
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,180
It's a major dilemma!

4
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,580
This is Shin Chaegyung, Mama.

5
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,160
Sit down.

6
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,530
The reason why I asked you to come to this palace was because

7
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,030
I wanted to hear your opinion
on this engagement proposal.

8
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,940
What?

9
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,610
Yes.. Hwang-Hu  Mama..

10
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,210
This was the former king and
your grandfather's promise.

11
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,070
What do you think of this?

12
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,700
Your burden will be heavy because you are still a student, right?

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,800
What?

14
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,620
Yes.. Hwang-Hu Mama..

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes. As a bride-to-be, you will have to respect the elders and bring forth many children,

16
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,990
but this is an important marriage
that cannot be done hastily.

17
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,370
To tell you the truth,

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,150
I came to tell you that I will get married.

19
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,140
Is that so?

20
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,000
I thought you were strongly against it.

21
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,150
If it's okay, can I ask you something?

22
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,050
What is it?

23
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,810
This is the only choice I have.

24
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,510
You might already know,

25
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,490
but my dad is unemployed,

26
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,240
and my mom is an insurance salesperson.

27
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,800
So?

28
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:02,010
So I'm guessing if my suffering
parents can be comfortable..

29
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm guessing you want a reasonable reward.

30
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,890
You are more shrewd then you look.

31
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,600
Are you making a proposal
with this marriage?

32
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,490
It's not a proposal, but a request-

33
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,220
That's not something you
should be involved in.

34
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,600
Because you will be part of the royal family,

35
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,940
your family will receive things that will secure your households reputation.

36
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:42,870
Oh then.. Thank you very much, Hwang-Hu Mama! I will marry!

37
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,890
Tae-Hu Mama is here.

38
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,270
This is Shin Chaegyung,
Your Highness.

39
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,630
Ah, this is you..

40
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,150
You look better in person!

41
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,490
So, I've heard you will accept
this engagement proposal?

42
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,700
If you will allow it, then I will.

43
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,090
Oh.. is that so?

44
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,030
What is on your skirt?

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,110
Sit.. sit please.

46
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,650
What kind of dye did you use?

47
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,720
Um.. it's fruit juice, Your Highness.

48
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,520
If you use an alum on a white fruit, you get a bright reddish color,

49
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,530
but this fruit has a pastel and natural color.

50
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,970
If it's that specific fruit,
it wouldn't be that color.

51
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,530
Maybe there are added chemicals..

52
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,070
Oh.. should we try dying with what she used?

53
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,950
It was a sudden event, and the decision should have been hard..

54
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,890
How did you come up with that decision?

55
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:52,490
That is.. well.. I thought..

56
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,410
Its okay, its okay…

57
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,860
You aren't used to this kind of language, so say it in the modern way.

58
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,700
I am still a HWS.. well..
it's like kh right now.. chul..

59
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,320
Our house got..

60
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,290
Do you know what she's talking about?

61
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,700
No, sorry.

62
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,130
I just caught some adjectives
and some articles.

63
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,200
HWS?

64
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,180
What kind of nickname is that?

65
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,150
Kh?

66
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,500
What is the meaning for those letters?

67
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,900
Lets go.

68
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,640
Please go in.

69
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,810
This way please.

70
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,730
Why am I so stupid?

71
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,350
Did I make the right decision?

72
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,490
Should I have just rejected the proposal?

73
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,620
Did I make the wrong decision?

74
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,100
Are you alright?

75
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,850
Yes.. I'm alright.

76
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,500
I can see the child in you.

77
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,370
You look a bit like your grandfather.

78
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,100
Do you know me?

79
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,060
Our grandpa too?

80
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,470
Oih, PE pants.

81
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,250
Please leave so I can talk with her alone.

82
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,020
Yes, prince.

83
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,950
It was a reluctant marriage,
but you made the right decision.

84
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,750
You're very ordinary, easy...

85
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,470
I think you'll be fun!

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,100
What?

87
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,950
Ordinary.. easy.. and fun?

88
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,030
It's like you're the main character of
a cheerful comic.

89
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,840
What?! Cheerful comic?!

90
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Mister! Mister!
Where can I get in the car?

91
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,180
If the king saw her, he wouldn't
have made the promise.

92
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,350
Even though she is a modern child,

93
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,100
her speech and manners
aren't fit for a princess..

94
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,430
We are of different ranks,
how can he pick a family like that?!

95
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,670
Shall I ask him why?

96
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,110
I'm sorry, Mama.

97
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,050
The king learned to write from the grandfather, and wrote this.

98
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,000
This letter shows that the
ranks aren't a problem.

99
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:46,620
She may have speech problems but her eyes
are clear and her personality is bright and pure.

100
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,900
She is a suitable bride for the prince.

101
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,110
The king always made right decisions.

102
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:12,860
He thought of the future and made this promise,
and we don't have the right to break it.

103
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:26,570
Do not complain about his decision.

104
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,720
Chaegyung, eat dinner.

105
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,570
What are you doing over there?

106
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,100
Aren't you going to eat?

107
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,530
I'm going to eat all the
fried pumpkin! PIG!

108
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,770
She's being moody, do something.

109
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,150
Tell her to eat.

110
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,520
Just leave her.

111
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,100
She's overreacting. Does she think she's the best child in the world, drowning in her own misery?

112
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,950
We said she didn't have to marry, but she went there with her own two feet.

113
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,000
Hey!

114
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,710
Your sister's!
Are you eating them all?!

115
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm marrying,

116
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,090
I'm not,

117
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,810
I am,

118
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:29,940
I'm not,

119
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,990
I am,

120
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm not..

121
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,160
I am..

122
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,280
Hey guys,

123
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,830
did you ever think about marriage?

124
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,580
Hey, a student marrying?!

125
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,010
I know, you crazy girl!

126
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,670
You idiot, marriage?! Yeah right!

127
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,220
In Korea, a regular persons
lifespan is 80 years.

128
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,830
Lets say we married at our age, then how long are you living with one person?!

129
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:22,050
That's like.. 80-19 = 61 years!
Tiring isn't it?!

130
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,750
I know! And if you're married, and someone you love appears.

131
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,410
What are you going to do?

132
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,370
So you shouldn't get married until you find someone you love.

133
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,450
You can't even date your lover.

134
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,000
That's right!

135
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,900
I didn't think of that!

136
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,070
Chaegyung Ah~!

137
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:57,850
Inside the ring, it's encrypted.
And you fit it in here.

138
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,320
And these two halves meet..

139
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,610
Dad! Dad!

140
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,470
This marriage is invalid!
Where is the engagement cup?!

141
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,580
Where did you hide it?
Where is it?!

142
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,640
This..?

143
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,030
Hey, hey!
The prince's wedding!

144
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,980
Hey, hey!

145
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,620
Oh my God, Jesus Christ, Superstar!

146
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,970
We have to grab this chance.

147
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,150
We have to rush the roya
l family's official announcements.

148
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,220
Yes sir. I will tell the gazette.

149
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,060
Lets continue what we were doing..

150
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,350
This is the list of the cultural relics
that had been seized to the foreign countries.

151
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,400
The ones on top are the cultural relics retrieved back by the royal family.

152
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,900
The ones on the bottom are
those to find back later.

153
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,250
Why?

154
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
Are you worried because the announcements have been postponed sooner,

155
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,840
or are you worried about how
all these people have to come?

156
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,160
Young Princess!

157
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,710
Come out and eat meat!

158
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,580
Yea! Princess!

159
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,400
Think that these are the intents of our ancestors, so eat and get strength!

160
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,610
Yeah, eat!

161
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,590
If you don't come out,
this prince will eat it all!

162
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,560
Hey.. don't cry.
I'll call you older sister.

163
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,470
I know.

164
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,950
I know how you feel.

165
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,570
What do you know?!

166
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,450
I know, man!

167
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,910
After your mom grabbed the wedding date,
she cried too.

168
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,150
What do I do, now what do I do?

169
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,230
Why does it have to be this picture!?

170
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,230
My middle school graduation picture.

171
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,950
It was the period of my life
when I was ugly and fat.

172
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,250
I'm ruined! I'm ruined!

173
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,510
Who gave this picture?

174
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,280
- Was it you?!
- It's not!

175
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's die together!

176
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
I won't be able to walk on
the streets anymore.

177
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,440
Pig! Pig!
Big trouble! Hurry and get up!

178
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,490
Get out, I'm sleepy.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

179
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,140
Scream.. There's a fuss outside!

180
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,060
Stop! We didn't even publicly announce it!

181
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,010
Our child has a school life!

182
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,710
You guys shouldn't do this! Go!

183
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,600
Pig! You can't go out!
Your enemies are too strong! Hey!

184
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,280
What's with all this noise?
I can't sleep at all.

185
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,000
Please stop laughing,
Your Highness.

186
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,330
How does the princess-to-be be so careless?

187
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,370
As more days pass,

188
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,920
she does things that
she shouldn't be doing.

189
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:06,830
We should have gotten the prince
a girl from a better family.

190
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,550
No, no. What did the king want?

191
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:18,820
She is a girl that's average, normal..
just an ordinary girl.

192
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,850
What do you think?

193
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,230
In the Royal family's history, there are no
Crown Princess' coming from commoners at all.

194
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,450
The Parliament and Media have given good comments over it.

195
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,650
Is that so?

196
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,150
It's also a good thing since
the Grand wedding this time,

197
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,470
has the meaning of the union between the Royal family and their country's people.

198
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,960
Look at her eyes!
There's no other frog!

199
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,460
Shh! Watch what you say!

200
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,200
But, did her grandpa really save the king's life?

201
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,650
That's what I said.

202
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,700
I heard what Her Majesty said,
but, well, I'm not sure.

203
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,980
I wonder what the real reason is.

204
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,890
Anyway, she's so lucky.

205
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,900
If my grandfather was like that,

206
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,820
maybe I could have been
the princess-to-be?

207
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,640
Yeah right. He's younger then us.

208
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,580
Anyway, then or now,
we need to be from great ancestors.

209
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,250
But this picture is so amusing.

210
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,930
Don't overreact!

211
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,050
- Mister.
- Mister.

212
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,810
You guys shouldn't tease someone
from the imperial house!

213
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,300
You shouldn't pay attention to these things!

214
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,990
It wasn't like that.

215
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,120
Quiet!

216
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,550
How could you guys be so careless with your words and actions!

217
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,550
What is the thing you have to be most careful of in the Palace?

218
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,440
Your mouths!

219
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:18,840
It doesn't matter who says it,
it won't be tolerated!

220
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,030
It wasn't just us..

221
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,010
Be quiet!

222
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:36,560
Did you guys forget the writing on the tablet?!
Memorize it immediately!

223
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,100
The mouth is the anger summoning door. The tongue is a mind destroying knife.

224
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:52,300
If you keep your mouth shut and your tongue still, your mind will be comfortable and anywhere, all will be well.

225
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,470
You're ready right?

226
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,770
Yea, fighting!

227
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,790
Why is there such a fuss?!

228
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm kind of reluctant..

229
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:24,390
1.. 2.. 3!

230
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,700
I want to be the worlds' famous ballet dancer.
If I marry a prince, don't I have to give it all up?

231
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,030
I got a pimple!

232
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,740
It's smaller then mine!

233
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,690
KangYeon ah.

234
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,660
Let's go!

235
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,710
What's going on?
Is it true? Is it really true?

236
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,490
Is it true?

237
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,000
I don't know! I'm ruined!

238
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,880
The prince is mine! He's mine.

239
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:31,390
How can you deceive us like that?
Chaegyung, you're an evil girl.

240
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,050
What are you talking about?
Who deceived who? I'm frustrated too!

241
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,540
Stop!

242
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,100
Hey! Who's wearing PE pants
under their skirt? Hey!

243
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,030
Hey Shin.

244
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,200
In the 21st century, who knew arranged marriages still existed?

245
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,950
Isn't it so overwhelming?

246
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,700
If you were going to marry, you should have gotten an audition.

247
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,050
Get all the stunning figured girls in line.

248
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,380
Wait for the chance and then hug them.

249
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,110
Yeah, wait for the chance and then hug them.

250
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,230
I should have done that.
Didn't think of it.

251
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,830
What about Hyorin?

252
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,660
Now what's going to happen
between you two?

253
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:40,380
Then, from a secret couple, you guys are now a useless couple!

254
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,710
Hey. Watch what you guys say.

255
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,680
So what? It's funny!

256
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,810
It's Shin Chaegyung! It's Shin Chaegyung!
Oh my God, what do I do? Hey sister!

257
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,130
Her eyes are so pretty!
Shin Chaegyung!

258
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,990
Shin Chaegyung is not dating, she's getting treated like Cinderella.

259
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:04,480
Who cares? Shin and Chaegyung don't look good together. I can never accept it.

260
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,160
But Kang Yeon, why are you so quiet?

261
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,500
She was like this from the start.
She said she wanted to "AKKK!" the cinderella's neck.

262
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,910
That's right.

263
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,520
Hey guys!

264
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,800
I'm sorry, I love you!

265
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,100
You guys, I wanted to tell you first but I couldn't tell
you cause of the situation I was in.

266
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,370
- Whatever.
- Let's go!

267
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,070
Hey! I have something to tell you guys.

268
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,610
I'm not some kind of Cinderella.

269
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,740
I'm the filial daughter, Shin Chung..
Do you understand, you adolescents?!

270
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,270
Oh? Isn't that Hyorin?
MIN HYORIN!

271
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,570
Bye.

272
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,690
Are you alright?

273
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,310
Don't you know that
Min Hyorin's gullible?

274
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,990
I only have one thing in mind.

275
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,770
My memory is full.

276
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,380
This is so you.

277
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,780
When are you coming back?

278
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,860
I'll visit the airport.

279
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,580
If I get an award..

280
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,760
I'll be going straight to ballet school.

281
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,100
But..

282
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,260
But if I don't win an award,
I'm not coming back.

283
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,630
Excuse me.
What do I have to do to ride the limousine bus?

284
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,920
Make a left turn and go to the departure.

285
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,900
Thank you.

286
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,000
Today we have some surprising news.

287
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,840
Yes, the Prince, Lee Shin, is going to get married.
And who might be the future princess?

288
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,710
Although he's still a high school student, it's possible for him to get married, right?

289
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,030
Yes.

290
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:19,140
It is some reasonable news.

291
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,390
However,
it's mere shocking news about the princess.

292
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,650
Yes, the Prince, Lee Shin, who had captured a lot of girls' hearts,

293
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,450
and the Princess goes to
the same school and their families..

294
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,280
Watch out!

295
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,870
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

296
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,290
Are you okay?

297
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,810
Are you hurt?

298
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,620
I'm alri..

299
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,120
Actually, I'm not alright.

300
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,750
Who is he?

301
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:23,580
...but they've been planning
this marriage for a long time.

302
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,780
A lot of people are showing interest towards the Princes' marriage

303
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,380
and also they are wondering who
this Shin Chaegyung girl is.

304
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,470
Father..

305
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,990
Yul is back.

306
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,010
The Queen has arrived!

307
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,400
Let her in.

308
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,730
The section of the Crown Princess is going smoothly and fast..

309
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,570
Nothing must go wrong during the hand asking,

310
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,830
presents offering and the wedding date.

311
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,160
Yes, Mama.

312
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,000
The wedding must follow the grand old Great Korea Empire style

313
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,500
of the Crown Prince's traditional Bride fetching.

314
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:12,550
Don't be too extravagant for the three things in front, keep it as simple as possible.

315
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,060
Yes.

316
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,960
I'll listen to all you have said.

317
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,020
Aren't you, Yul Sang Goon Mama?

318
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,240
Mama!

319
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,030
Mister!

320
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,330
Do you recognize me?

321
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:58,380
Of course! Before you left to England, I was the one who played and piggybacked you when you were young.

322
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,930
Yes, I remember.

323
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,970
You look the same.

324
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,300
Great Queen and the King
have missed you a lot.

325
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,760
- What happened to you..
- Yul Sang Goon Mama!

326
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,800
Nanny!

327
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:34,530
Is this a dream or reality?
I knew you'd come back alive.

328
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,740
The Great Queen will be extremely happy.

329
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,760
Let's go in.

330
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,320
You've become a grown man already.

331
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,650
For these past years,
I had never forgotten about you.

332
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,820
Yul..

333
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,070
But why did you come by yourself?

334
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,920
What about your mom?

335
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:18,030
Mom will take a long time to come back since she has some things to take care of.

336
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,590
Then, are you thinking of staying here forever?

337
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,800
Yes, Halma Mama.

338
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,950
Yes, good choice.

339
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,550
Then, where are you staying?

340
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,950
I'm living in a rented house.

341
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:46,400
What? You should have stayed at the Yong Mu Palace.
Isn't your fathers' memorial Hall over there as well?

342
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,960
But it seems to need
some repairs over there.

343
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,110
That's right.

344
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,260
It's true that the place was old.

345
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,630
Move inside the Goong, since you'll be uncomfortable at the rented house.

346
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,180
Excuse me, Mama.

347
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,110
But the law states that the old Kings' son is to be living outside the Goong.

348
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,190
That's right.

349
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:24,590
I wasn't thinking right cause I was too impatient.

350
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:32,330
Oh! Then you should be looking for the "Wang Nip" high school.

351
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:40,480
Great Queen,
I won't go to "Wang Nip" High School.

352
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,270
I have studied design when I was in England.

353
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,140
What a freak!

354
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
Look at her.

355
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,080
To be honest,
isn't she not the type to be a princess?

356
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,290
It seems like she doesn't fit the level.

357
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,810
Forget about it.
I'll take care of my problems.

358
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,900
Just stay calm!

359
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,210
I took the wrong route.

360
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,760
Oy! Wait.

361
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,950
Where are you going? Let's talk.

362
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,650
I didn't know that you can still face the
camera with your type of mentality.

363
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,250
What? Mentality?

364
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,390
I'm assuming you're preparing already.

365
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,560
Preparing for what?

366
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,890
The preparations to enter the Palace.

367
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,450
Someone will be
coming to your house.

368
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,550
Entering the Palace?

369
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,050
You don't know about it?

370
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,300
It's for the Crown Princess' education.

371
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,900
I don't know if you can cope with it.

372
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
What's up with that
facial expression of yours?

373
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,550
You're the one who agreed to the marriage, while asking for money at the same time.

374
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,950
What?

375
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,750
It doesn't matter to me,
so I don't care.

376
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,550
Anyway, be fully prepared and not get me into
a dumb situation because this is not a joke.

377
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,900
Hey, Shin Goon!

378
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,950
WHAT? Shin Goon?

379
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,150
Yeah, Shin Goon.

380
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,900
Let me ask you something.

381
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,580
You can just marry the girl you
like and stop boasting.

382
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,330
What?

383
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,800
You had a girl that you proposed to then,

384
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,550
why did you tell your parents that you wanted to get married to me?

385
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,890
You're so funny.

386
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,950
You don't seem to know anything.

387
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:42,170
Do you think I want to let the girl I like be
trapped inside a Goong forever as a princess?

388
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,700
Then what about me?

389
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,850
I told you before.

390
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,410
You and I have nothing in relation.

391
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,250
I don't care what happens to you, so that's why I'm marrying you.

392
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,800
What did you say?

393
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,490
Shouldn't you be grateful that I'm
marrying you without any complaints?

394
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,500
What did you say?

395
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,500
Then are you saying that
instead of being your girlfriend,

396
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,030
you want me to marry you and be trapped and work in the Goong?

397
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,550
Nonetheless, whatever, you should not forget, whatever the reason may be,

398
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,800
the truth is that you're going to be a princess.

399
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,590
If you want to be my wife, you have to upgrade your level or else you'll be in trouble.

400
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,900
Do you know?

401
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,200
You do know that your level of
being a princess is low, right?

402
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,110
Level?

403
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:36,390
I don't want your stupidity to interfere with me.
Got it?

404
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,980
And you..
take off those dirty sweatpants.

405
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,800
If you really can't, then I'll call in a person to teach you some manners..

406
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,230
Just go and learn it yourself!
You jerk!

407
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,850
You never seem to alter my expectations.

408
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,700
What a jerk!

409
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,950
What did you say?

410
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:37,680
I'm going to put on laces and ribbons in these
and I'll wear them to the Goong just for you!

411
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,880
You think I won't wear these
inside the Goong?

412
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,690
Why does it hurt?

413
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,720
HEY!
What's that?!

414
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,180
HALT!
What is your building? What's your grade?

415
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,480
HEY! HALT NOW!

416
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,900
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

417
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,980
Where is the arts office?

418
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,700
Arts?
It's next to this building on the second floor.

419
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,910
You need to prepare for
the marriage faster.

420
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,080
Eh?

421
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,880
I still have a lot of time left
for school to be over.

422
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,670
And also,
my backpack is inside the classroom.

423
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,290
You want to fall in love with my charisma?

424
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,620
Go in!

425
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,960
Be quiet.

426
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,140
Come on in.

427
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,970
Let's be quiet.

428
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,530
Listen up! Today we have a new alien.

429
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,950
[POSTER: Planet Room]

430
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,570
Alright, alright!
His name is Lee Yul.

431
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,100
- He's a good-looking alien, right?
- Yeah!

432
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,800
Yul has lived in England since he was 5 years old, is that right?

433
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,880
So he will need a lot of your help.

434
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,800
And you guys know that there's no isolation in this classroom, right?

435
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,850
YES!

436
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,140
Hey, be prepared and l
et's open up our books.

437
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,660
You don't have the book right?

438
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,030
Then this time you came here for good?

439
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,580
Yeah.

440
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,710
You look exactly the same as the picture.

441
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,360
You too, look the same when Nyou mailed your picture.

442
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,140
I knew you right away.

443
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,490
Do you still remember the
last time we saw each other?

444
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,230
When we were 5 years old.

445
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,020
It was during the summer, right?
I think it was really hot.

446
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,200
It was during the winter.

447
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,670
When I arrived in England,
it was February. I'm positive.

448
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,490
Was it really?

449
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,100
By the way,
I heard you're getting married.

450
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,560
Yeah, pretty much.

451
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,010
The girl must be really pretty.

452
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,050
What do you mean?

453
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:47,130
I thought that the girl might stop the marriage and
refuse to marry you because of your personality.

454
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,030
Of course, it's not for free.

455
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,030
She's the girl that's going to
get everything she needs.

456
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,720
Don't worry,
she's not that pretty.

457
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,830
She's cute.

458
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,790
What?! She's cute?!

459
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,380
Don't joke around,
do you know how uncouth she it?

460
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,900
I don't see her a lot but I can tell that it's her.

461
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,450
That's why the only reason why I didn't stop this marriage is because,

462
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,350
I want to see her having a hard time with the elders. Isn't it funny?

463
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,760
Oh yeah! You said you're in arts, right?

464
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,900
You could be in her class since she's also in arts.
What classroom are you in?

465
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,980
BRING BACK THE PRINCE!
BRING HIM BACK! BRING HIM BACK!

466
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:57,340
BRING BACK THE PRINCE!
BRING HIM BACK! BRING HIM BACK!

467
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,330
SHIN CHAE GYUNG, YOU MUST KILL YOURSELF!
KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF!

468
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,990
I need to measure you.

469
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,420
Please turn around.

470
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,830
Seven and a half.

471
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,180
Twenty-one.

472
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:23,210
After that one newspaper article, the entire house has been a wreck!

473
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,300
And also,
not only the photographers,

474
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,810
but also those fanclubs,

475
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,320
they are such a pain!

476
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:37,020
And what if something happens to my daughter,
what are you going to do about it?

477
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,740
They say to destroy her.

478
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,410
Things will get better as
the news is fully announced.

479
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:50,070
Don't worry, there will also be someone from
the palace guards to ensure her safety.

480
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,130
So from Palace guards?

481
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,800
So in another words, a type of bodyguard.

482
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,590
Mom.. It's coming! It's coming!

483
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,050
And I will pass the news
onto the news anchor.

484
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,390
Never once in the Royal family's history,
has there been a Section of the Crown princess like this..

485
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,900
Now, not only a symbol of power,

486
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,090
they are also the Royal family that blends in with the public.

487
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,800
They are now no longer
just the privileged class

488
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,520
but the Royal family who is as close as your next door neighbors.

489
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,150
This national wedding symbolizes the union
between the people and the Royal family.

490
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:29,800
The Royal family in the new year of 2006 has
definitely started out on a strong, steady step.

491
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,370
Hey Hyorin!

492
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,300
Yes?

493
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,900
The practice room is set.
When do you want to come?

494
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,000
No, I'll come down right now.

495
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,170
Will you be fine?
Aren't you tired?

496
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,100
Alright then,
I'll see you in 10 minutes at the lobby.

497
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,440
Okay.

498
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,520
What was Yul's reason for coming back here?

499
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,270
He didn't say anything.

500
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,650
Why?

501
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,310
Is there a problem?

502
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,050
There are only a few people who know that the King's health is deteriorating.

503
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,170
I'm afraid that there may be
a connection with this matter.

504
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:42,800
If not, why would a person that has no news at all in 14 years, come back suddenly at this time.

505
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,250
Doesn't it seem strange to you?

506
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,100
So you came all the way
here because of this?

507
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:55,570
From now on, you need to be aware of Yul when you meet him.

508
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,900
Let's start again.

509
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,060
Is it right for us to do this?

510
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,940
My heart feels uncomfortable too.

511
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,090
But what can we do?

512
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,560
We can't go back on our
promise to the Royal family.

513
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,610
Hey, why aren't you sleeping?

514
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:04,540
Mommy! My tummy hurts! It hurts..

515
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,990
Come here.
Mom will rub it for you.

516
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:24,200
Mom's hand is a magical hand,
the princess is a big belly..

517
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,830
How can this immature girl get married?

518
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,920
Does your stomach really hurt?

519
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,160
It's true!

520
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,460
My stomach almost made a hole!
A hole this big.

521
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,670
Then should I put on the red medicine?

522
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:53,180
Dad, you're such a grandpa!
What do you mean by red medicine?

523
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,030
Then I guess I should poke
your fingers with a needle.

524
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,500
Chae Joon! Bring me a needle.

525
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,390
No, dad! I'm all better now.
And Chae Joon is sleeping.

526
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,830
You're still the same when you try to get attention by pretending to be sick.

527
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,430
Come here.
I'll take the wax out of your ear.

528
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,360
Your ear is full of wax!
Good thing I'm doing this.

529
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,850
Oh.. it feels good.

530
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,180
How is it? Is it tight on you?

531
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,690
Wow! So pretty!
You remind me of grandmother.

532
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,750
Really?

533
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,000
Pretty.

534
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,770
Eat well and don't get stomach aches. Okay?

535
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,200
Oh, right!
Did you pack the extra medicine?

536
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,120
I packed it.

537
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,480
You better listen to mom and dad.
Okay?!

538
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,360
Don't worry, pig!

539
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,530
Next time you come and visit,
I'll show you my muscles!

540
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,550
We better hurry up.

541
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,400
My little princess..
Dad, blame all these on your useless Dad.

542
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,880
Oh, really..
Am I being dragged to jail?

543
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,070
Our princess is really the filial daughter,
Shin Chung..

544
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:15,640
Just stop it. If I'm really Shin Chung, then wouldn't you be Blind man Shin?

545
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,490
Then, what about Mom?
Is she the runaway Mom?

546
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,120
You are really..

547
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:41,350
I made the choice. I'll take responsibility for my life. Don't worry.
