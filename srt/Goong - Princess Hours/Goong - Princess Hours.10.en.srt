1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,310
Episode 10

2
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,410
Mama.

3
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,250
What's the outcome of it?

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,660
Yes... about that...

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,650
Why is it like that?

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,350
Did you find any news?

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,910
Why didn't you report it quickly?

8
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,210
According to what I got from the Palace's Internal News Department...

9
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,700
BingungMama...
she seems to be together with a guy.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,230
And they had left the school, Mama.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,600
What?

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,660
Hello?

13
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,350
Maybe I didn't hear the phone ring.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,220
Here?

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,070
The Botanical garden.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,450
Yes.

17
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,670
She's with me now.

18
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,680
I won't ask you why you went with her to the Botanical Garden.

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,600
Yul.

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,300
Both of us must calm down.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,200
We have already started a war.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a war that can't guarantee we'll win and it'll be very hard and long.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,200
We have to keep your eyes open
and be on our guards.

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,020
We must also keep awake
when our enemies are sleeping.

25
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,280
Even if it's like this, it's a hard and long war that doesn't guarantee us winning either.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,660
Do you get my words?

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,080
That means to say that you
don't even have the free time

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,850
to bring that stupid girl who's now your cousin's wife to the Botanical Garden.

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,750
The Palace is now in chaos because of the Princess' disappearance.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,650
It'll put you in unfavorable state
if they find her with you.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,980
So you must come home quickly right now.
You get that?

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,600
Are you listening to your mother?

33
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,760
Yul!

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm listening.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,350
Yes.

36
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,620
Yes.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,320
Yes.

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,200
Who is it?

39
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,410
How much time we have left?

40
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,290
Only about thirty minutes.

41
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,980
Will we be able to reach there on time?

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,450
Honestly, there seems to be some difficulties.

43
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,350
Bangkok city traffic is well-known worldwide to be the worst, Jeonha.

44
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,090
We'll ask for help from
the Thailand's police department.

45
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,000
Internal Officer.

46
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,300
Because of the road blocks, they are now using the motorcycles as transport to get here.

47
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,600
They will be here in about ten minutes.

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,950
We have about five minutes before the interview starts.

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,850
Before the interview...

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,880
We'll first show you a video about the Crown Prince, Lee Shin.

51
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,160
We'll start the Prince's interview after it.

52
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,380
Nae Gwan Nessi.

53
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,350
He's stranded on his way here because of a festive celebration on the street. He won't be able to make it.

54
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,250
How long does he need for us to hold out?

55
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,650
He needs at least about fifteen more minutes, Nae Gwan Nessi.

56
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
Hello.

57
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,930
We're here.

58
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Thank you.

59
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,100
I know who you are.
You are the Prince of Korea, am I right?

60
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,090
I know you.

61
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,990
No, thank you.

62
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Thank you.

63
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,820
Wait, please!

64
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,900
Thank you.

65
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,600
Nae Gwan Nessi, the Prince has just arrived.

66
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,450
Oh really?

67
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,150
Sir, there's only one minute left.

68
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,650
Mama, Mama!

69
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,550
BingungMama.

70
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,950
The Queen is waiting for you now.

71
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,520
I've filmed an action movie, today.

72
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,250
Do you know the name?

73
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,980
"Ong Bak Ga Onr Li"

74
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,960
Let's get started.

75
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,900
The Prince of Korea, Lee Shin has arrived.
Please welcome him.

76
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,400
The Thai word for the Republic of Korea
is "Ga Onr Li".

77
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,350
I heard that the Thai word
for Korea is "Ga Onr Li".

78
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,450
"Ga Onr Li" in Korean
means noble and beautiful.

79
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,650
In Korean, "Ga Onr Li"
means superior and beautiful.

80
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,540
I came from a noble and beautiful country.

81
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,350
To a country that has long historical culture and beautiful flowers.

82
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,300
Some can say that I came from the superior and beautiful country...

83
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,950
and I have come to visit this country of superior culture and beautiful flowers.

84
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,230
Princess, don't you have any brains at all?

85
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,850
Everybody have their own life's rules of things that's being allowed and not.

86
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,780
A student has rules to be conform
to the student's identity.

87
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,580
A soldier has rules to be conform to the soldier's identity as well.

88
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,040
Do we set these rules to let them to be opposed and neglected as people wish?

89
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,900
No.

90
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,730
The Royal family's set of rules are called Laws.

91
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,650
They are not for people to do as they please.

92
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,300
But, they are set for people to treat them seriously and to be followed strictly.

93
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,280
Do you understand?!

94
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,250
Why do you have to make me
worry for you every day?!?

95
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,070
I'm sorry.

96
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,530
I'm at fault, Mama.

97
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,510
Hwang-hu Mama.

98
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,580
BingungMama, she...

99
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,050
Hwi Sung Goon,
there's no need for you to speak up for her.

100
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,930
I was the one who made the suggestion,
Hwang-hu Mama.

101
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,520
BingungMama wanted to ask
for permission at first.

102
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,260
It was me who said there's no need,
we can go there directly.

103
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,950
Hwi Sung Goon.

104
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,950
The Princess is going to be
the future mother of the nation.

105
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,150
Although I don't know how the Princess's parents brought up her up...

106
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,300
Or how she had lived...

107
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,030
She must obey the Royal family's laws once she married into our family.

108
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,950
Do you understand?

109
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,470
Yes, Mama.

110
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,200
Self-control...
You need to have more self-control!

111
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
This is what the women of
the Royal family must have.

112
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
You must remember,
you must keep this in heart.

113
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,550
Yes.

114
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,800
Mama.

115
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,870
The Great Queen calls for you.

116
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,550
I know.

117
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,410
Princess, you are not allowed to leave the Palace until I give my orders.

118
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,690
You are to reflect on your faults.

119
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,530
Sorry.

120
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,050
Chaegyung!

121
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,000
Shin Chaegyung!

122
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,730
Mom!

123
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,990
My child..

124
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
Dad!

125
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,100
Chaegyung!

126
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,820
Dad!

127
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,520
- ChaeJoon!
- Pig..

128
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,750
Dad!

129
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,540
Cutting out a corner of the Winter
solstice month's long night.

130
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,250
Layer upon layer on the blanket of
the spring breeze.

131
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,500
When the person I love has slept.

132
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll cover her nightly with devotion.

133
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,060
Don't you feel strange why I suddenly recited this old poem to you?

134
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,950
Worried and anxious were how
I felt waiting for you.

135
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,200
This is just the feeling.

136
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,650
Cutting out a corner of
the Winter solstice month's long night.

137
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,200
Layer upon layer was piling up when every second counts at that time.

138
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,960
Jeonha...

139
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,690
Please don't let this situation happen again.

140
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,200
If this ever happens again, I don't know how many years of my life will be cut off.

141
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,250
I understand.

142
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,200
I'll take note of it.

143
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,800
In exchange...

144
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,050
You are not to call yourself "So-In"
anymore from now on.

145
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,570
Jeonha...

146
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,650
You once said that I'm the sky, right?

147
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,320
Yes, Jeonha.

148
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,650
Today, Internal Officer,
you are like the sky to me.

149
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,050
You are not suitable to be using such phases, since we are each other's sky.

150
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,810
Jeonha...

151
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,050
However...

152
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,800
Then, it'll be all for today.

153
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,250
Go back and rest as you must be tired as well.

154
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm tired too.

155
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,550
Yes, Jeonha.

156
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,560
Mother.

157
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,580
Please make me the king.

158
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Unni...

159
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Are my eyes really swollen?

160
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,830
Although they are a little swollen..

161
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,370
They look fine to me, Mama.

162
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,590
That's right.

163
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,200
You look very pretty today as well, Mama.

164
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,650
Unni, why are your eyes so swollen?

165
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,260
Unni, you too..

166
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,350
I... We?

167
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,740
Yul Goon!

168
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,750
Are you alright?

169
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,740
Yes, I'm fine.

170
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,160
Did Shin call you?

171
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,560
Your face has slimmed down a lot.

172
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,630
Really?

173
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,050
Seems like among all the diets, going on an empty stomach is still the best way.

174
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,030
I had tried before the popcorn diet, eggs diet and many others as well.

175
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,330
But I just can't get of the fats in my face.

176
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,980
Has it really slimmed down?

177
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,070
Really?

178
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,160
You are like Shin Chaegyung now.

179
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,730
It's good for you to be laughing like this.

180
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,650
I'll be by your side forever,
just to make you smile.

181
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,270
Don't forget it.

182
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,270
Do you know that Prince William
is coming over today?

183
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,010
The whole world's teenage girls' dream...

184
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,560
William...!

185
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,310
As for me, my English is really lousy...

186
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,630
So Yul Goon,
can you help me welcome Prince William?

187
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,210
Yes, it's like this.. Right..
Just like this..

188
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,870
Let's drink a little more..

189
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,850
The last one.

190
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,740
Look.. you did really well..

191
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,010
So well-behave..

192
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,800
There's Hye Jung Gong over here.

193
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,840
What?

194
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,950
Mama. Since the time, Hye Jung Gong was the Crown Princess...

195
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,800
She was already very active in the charity works.

196
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,010
Right, that's right.

197
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,850
Hye Jung Gong has always been very concerned over the Welfare services.

198
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,210
The Great Queen is the person that's most concerned over the Welfare services.

199
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,950
Impoverished children, handicapped and old people, welfare services...

200
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,200
The Great Queen has never even
missed out a single area.

201
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,200
That's the truth, Mama.

202
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,690
This old lady went visiting because she has too much free time. There's nothing special about it.

203
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,750
The Queen, aren't you also involved with the women welfare services as well?

204
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,330
Yes, Mama.

205
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:08,550
Queen has been involved in the unwed mothers, protectors of babies and women Associations..

206
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,030
Every area that involves women welfares and she has been doing all these silently.

207
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,000
Right, that's right.

208
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,060
Social welfares are what we,
the Royal family should do.

209
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,930
Yes, Mama.

210
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,580
That's right.

211
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,250
Although it's important as well
to do things quietly like you...

212
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,200
But setting an good example like Hye Jung Gong is important too..

213
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,050
Hye Jung Gong has more freedom than both of us.

214
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,760
So just let her be the representative of the Royal family to get more involved in many other welfare events.

215
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,570
Yes, Mama.

216
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,950
Your highness..
The Queen has arrived.

217
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,000
Pyeha.

218
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,790
It's time to drink your medicine.

219
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

220
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,090
Don't just worry about your work.

221
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,950
You must also take some time out for a walk to loosen your muscles.

222
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes, I'll..

223
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,340
I'll try to remember.

224
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,650
But why do you look so unwell?

225
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,500
Have you heard about those reports about Hye Jung Gong doing welfare services?

226
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,210
Welfare services?

227
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,950
Yes.

228
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,850
She hasn't returned to the Palace for long.

229
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,500
But she has been showing
herself off in almost everywhere.

230
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,580
This really doesn't seem normal at all.

231
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,650
I'm also worried about the Great Queen's attitude towards Hye Jung Gong as well.

232
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,940
Instead of rebuking...

233
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,050
She has been supporting and accommodating her.

234
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,900
Maybe she felt guilty towards Hye Jung Gong when she thinks about what happened 14 years ago?

235
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,340
Speaking from the Royal family's view, is there anyone who doesn't feel sorry for them?

236
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,190
Can the Prince be able to handle everything?

237
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,950
He'll naturally have a sense of responsibility when he's far away from the Palace's walls.

238
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,880
I was once like this as well.

239
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,010
Welcome, Prince William.

240
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,550
I'm welcoming you on your priceless present-giving visit with from the bottom of my heart.

241
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,250
I'm very sorry for my late visit.

242
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,990
Thank you very much for your warm welcome.

243
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,690
Hwangtae Pyeha.

244
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,450
We have already cut a lot of ceremonial procedures for the visit this time.

245
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,750
In its place, the main schedule will be centered on experiencing the Korean traditional Cultures.

246
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,580
Yes.

247
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,180
The England's Prince has always shown an interest in Korean traditional cultures.

248
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,700
The Royal ceremonial group has especially prepared this part.

249
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:44,900
Thank you very much.

250
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,590
I've always wanted to come to Korea.

251
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,660
Is that so?

252
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,290
I hope that you will be comfortable as always during your stay.

253
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,970
The new Princess will be accompanying you on your daily schedule.

254
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,580
I saw your beautiful wedding on television.

255
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,800
Yes.

256
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,200
I must say, you're much more beautiful in real life, than on television.

257
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,370
Beautiful...

258
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,370
Thank you.

259
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,390
This is...

260
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,390
This is a very beautiful Palace...

261
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,900
Ok.. And also this is... paper..

262
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,950
The doors are made out of paper...

263
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,760
Paper.. OK?

264
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,800
Hi!

265
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,850
How you doin' Yul?

266
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,750
- Hi, I'm fine.
- Nice to see you again.

267
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,450
How's it goin'?

268
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,790
The weather is awful in London.

269
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
It's very very nice here though.

270
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,670
Yeah, the weather in Korea is very good.

271
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,150
How.. how's studies?

272
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,800
Okay? It's lovely today again...

273
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,650
Long time no see you.

274
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,330
Just a moment...

275
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,380
Yul Goon.

276
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,300
Is Prince William your friend?

277
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,550
He's not my friend.

278
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,450
He's my Hyung.
*hyung = older brother*

279
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,300
Hyung?

280
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,580
Hyung.

281
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,490
Hyung?

282
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,230
Hyung!

283
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,040
Hyung....?

284
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,950
- Hyung.
- Your pronunciation's really accurate.

285
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,300
Try asking him if he knows my name?

286
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,550
Do you remember her name?

287
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,650
Shin Eungyung...?

288
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,930
Shin Chaegyung.

289
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,980
Shin Taegyung, ah~...

290
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,050
Chaegyung. Chaegyung.

291
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,280
Taegyung.

292
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,690
Ahh~~... it's Shin Chaegyung...

293
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,050
- Shin... Shin Chaegyung...
- Shin Chaegyung.

294
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,550
Shin Chaegyung.

295
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,150
- Good night, Yul.
- Good night.

296
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,550
William too. Good night.

297
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,850
Good night.

298
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,560
Have you talked with Shin over the phone?

299
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,600
The phone hasn't left your
side for the whole day.

300
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,740
It's over.

301
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,860
Again?

302
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,300
You really miss him that much?

303
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,850
Who...?

304
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,200
That guy who travels away for the first time and he doesn't even calls back.

305
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,130
I sound like a naggy wife, right?

306
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,580
You said this before,
if the person you met first was me,

307
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,890
then there is a possibility
that you will like me right?

308
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,430
If the accident didn't happen,

309
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,950
or if he passed away after he was the King,

310
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,550
If it was like that we would be...

311
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,500
Jeonha.

312
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,370
Crown Princess called again a few times today.

313
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,390
Please don't be shy.

314
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,450
Yes. I know.

315
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,300
Why do you have that expression?

316
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:23,550
Do whatever that comes to your mind. It's the best way to express your feelings.

317
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,480
To welcome Prince William visitation in Korea,

318
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,730
I will perform another song.

319
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,510
How was your visit?

320
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,500
It's absolutely fantastic.
Thank you very much for your warm welcome.

321
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,680
I hope you had fun in Korea.

322
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,690
Oh so much fun.
It's really good.

323
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,950
I was very very impressed with the...
what's that thing?

324
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,350
Seul Keum.

325
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,050
Seul Keum? Seul Keum?

326
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,890
- Seul Keum?
- Yeah, Seul Keum.

327
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,230
Yes, I was very impressed with the way you played it.

328
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,290
I don't even know what he means.

329
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,090
He means he enjoys
your performance with the Seul Keum.

330
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,360
Very, very good.

331
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,980
Me too, me too.

332
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,860
This is great! It's finally over.

333
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,550
Thanks a lot.

334
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,620
If it wasn't for you,
it wouldn't have been successful.

335
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,260
What's there to thank? I didn't do much.

336
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,170
What "didn't do much"?

337
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,350
My husband didn't even do anything to help.

338
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,070
You're always there to help me.

339
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,000
What is that?

340
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,660
Chocolate.

341
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,350
I know that you didn't eat much for lunch today.

342
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,380
You only drank water.

343
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,060
Is it?

344
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,780
Try it.

345
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,850
I will eat it later.

346
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,000
Having a good friend like you
who asks for nothing in return,

347
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,270
I am really comforted.

348
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,730
It doesn't mean that I ask for nothing in return

349
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,580
What do you mean by that?

350
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,580
Even if I am not your husband now,

351
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,230
I was once your fiance.

352
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,580
Fiance?

353
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,440
You're still not the normal type
of thick-headedness.

354
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,490
I dropped you so many hints.

355
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,190
The person who was first engaged to you...

356
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,520
It was not Shin but me.

357
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,410
Although it was changed
when my father passed away.

358
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,780
But I hope you can remember that...

359
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,580
even if it's now impossible to come true.

360
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,760
If it wasn't fate playing with us...

361
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,550
Your husband right now
wouldn't have been Shin.

362
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,360
But me, Yul.

363
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,180
Mama, does the food not suit your taste?

364
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,950
Is there anything special that you'll like to have, Mama?

365
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,280
I'm done eating.

366
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,060
Mama, are you ok?

367
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,780
Mama.

368
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,580
I guess I was just too nervous about Prince William's visitation.

369
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,850
I am going to rest now.

370
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,000
Hello, King.

371
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,900
Have you been well, Hye Jung Gong?

372
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,650
Can we take a walk?

373
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,580
It's a sunny day.
Let's get some sunlight.

374
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:43,560
We all had been very worried for you
and Hwi Sung Goon.

375
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,540
The two of you must have suffered lots of hardships in a foreign country.

376
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,160
I can't face my deceased brother.

377
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,900
Do you know why I came back?

378
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,280
It is time.

379
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,010
Please return the original title
to Crown Prince Hyo Ryul.

380
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,050
Original title?

381
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:24,170
What I meant is to mourn for the
dead king before you.

382
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,950
The truth is mourning for the dead King...

383
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,740
is what I have been thinking of.

384
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,310
But it is a very sensitive topic,
politically speaking.

385
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,720
The timing and the procedures, these details need to be discussed.

386
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,430
It is not something I can decide alone.

387
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,720
Oppa.

388
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,090
-I am sorry, Oppa.
-Sister in-law!

389
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,140
No... Hye Jung Gong.

390
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,050
Please don't be like this.

391
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,890
Time that passed is really like a lie.

392
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,640
How many times does a beautiful autumn like this been coming and leaving?

393
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,390
For my own desires,

394
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,400
I have been touching,
climbing, rolling and hitting.

395
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,040
Lives are not used for living but instead they're used for disappearing, right?

396
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,160
Why was I so foolish?

397
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,630
That time....

398
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,290
My heart towards Oppa was real...

399
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,000
Pyeha, what are you doing here?

400
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,870
Oh, Hwang-hu...

401
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,870
Queen.

402
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,170
It is time for your medication.
I've been looking for you for a long time.

403
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,760
But what are you doing here alone?

404
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,060
Just taking a walk in the morning.

405
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,880
Yes. It is a beautiful autumn.

406
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,050
Did you manage to enter into the Palace by taking the exams?

407
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,770
I heard from the other Sang gongs that it is needed to take the exams to enter the Palace.

408
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,190
Yes. It is like that, BingungMama.

409
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,750
You must have studied real hard then?

410
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,990
But still, I don't understand.

411
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,110
You can't go home and
you can't get married.

412
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,480
You all strive real hard to get in here,
isn't that too cruel?

413
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,500
We came in here to serve the Imperial Family for the rest of our lives.

414
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
This is why we enter the Palace.

415
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We are already blessed to be able
to serve the Royal family.

416
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,650
This is really admirable, regardless.

417
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,360
We are worried for you since
you haven't been eating.

418
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,460
Please have this before
we report anything to the top.

419
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,760
What is this?

420
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,310
I noticed that you have been getting thinner for the past few days,

421
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,080
So I prepared herb medicine for you.

422
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,640
Korean herb medicine.
I dislike "Korean herb medicine" the most.

423
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,050
I will drink it later.

424
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,590
You must drink it immediately.

425
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,320
Princess, you are someone who will become future mother of the nation.

426
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,510
I'm a little not used to the future word.

427
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,300
Future mother of the nation.

428
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,050
For a useless fellow like me..

429
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:17,750
Just take the position of the Crown Princess as a training time period for you.

430
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,500
To get prepared before you become a Queen.

431
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,550
Before long,

432
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,800
After the Grown up ceremonial is over..

433
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,730
You will become a Queen mother of the child who will be of Royal heritage.

434
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,390
What?

435
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,150
Mo..mother?

436
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,230
Mother.

437
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,840
Are you telling me that,
I'm gonna be a mother?

438
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,080
When both of you have passed the legal age then,

439
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,760
The Royal family and the people of Korea will anticipate the new birth of a Royal child.

440
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:52,050
The Royal family tend to give birth earlier than normal families.

441
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,400
It won't be long before they start discussing about the sharing of the same room.

442
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,020
Sharing of the same room?

443
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:28,200
Praising the country of its cultural
and its natural beauty...

444
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,790
have brought in very good response, Jeonha.

445
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,110
But Jeonha...

446
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,750
Where is your watch?

447
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh my watch?

448
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,850
I traded it for my speech.

449
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,860
Yes?

450
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,780
What's wrong... are you sick?

451
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,740
...or are you out here to welcome me home?

452
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,280
In that case,
let me take a closer look at your face.

453
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,290
Stop right there.

454
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,950
Just stop right there.

455
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,850
If you make another move,
I will hit you till half dead.

456
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,950
That's a bit depressing.

457
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,650
Not allowing your husband who has been away for so long to be near you.

458
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,690
Don't you watch TV drama?

459
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,400
At this point of time,
you should just save up on any talks.

460
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,200
Pretending to be stupid and run directly into your husband's embrace.

461
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,950
Seeing you makes me lose my appetite.

462
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,260
You only know about yourself.

463
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,260
You are selfish.

464
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,200
You don't care about others' feelings.

465
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,200
You are the world's most revolting person.

466
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,820
I see.

467
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,500
I think next time we have to go together.

468
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,500
I see.

469
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,700
Seja, it must have been hard on you to travel to such a hot country.

470
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,490
It must be hard on you as well, Internal Officer.

471
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,850
Thank you, Mama.

472
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,850
Yes...

473
00:49:55,850 --> 00:50:00,820
I heard that the Thai Media have a good impression of the Prince as well.

474
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,580
The future collaborations with Thailand,

475
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,250
Crown Prince will handle those increasing responsibilities on behalf of the King.

476
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,050
I know you had a hard time.

477
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,290
But I know that you can excel in this.

478
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,550
I was just only doing my duties as a Prince.

479
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,650
But the truth is, I didn't do this alone.

480
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,200
I got the help from "heaven".

481
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,010
Are you troubled?

482
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,030
You can't sleep and you came here to do yoga the whole day.

483
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,900
Teacher.

484
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,510
Yes?

485
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,640
You told me about Camilla the other time.

486
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,430
What about that?

487
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:22,110
Can you please tell me more about her?
Becoming the friend of the family.

488
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,200
You mean how to become
the friend of the Royal family?

489
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes.

490
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,460
Hyorin, you are here?

491
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,740
Did you read the newspaper?

492
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,790
Let's see.

493
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,410
- Do you want some tea?
What do you like? I'll go make it.

494
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,950
[Death Anniversary ceremony of Prince Hyo Ryul]

495
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,050
Why are you suddenly so "attentive"?

496
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,020
I'm just trying to be good to her.

497
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,990
She's the manager in charge.

498
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,720
Manager?

499
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,970
We are from the same riding club.

500
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,810
Hyorin is the manager in the club.

501
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,710
Is that so?

502
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,250
The Royals and the friends of the Crown Prince are members of the club.

503
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,300
Shin is the president.

504
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,570
Is it?

505
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,310
Chaegyung and I are the new members.

506
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,370
Crown Princess as well?

507
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,560
The people at the club didn't agree to it.

508
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,050
But I insisted.

509
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:22,250
How can the Crown Princess
not be in the Royal riding club?

510
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,200
Have you cleared up your feelings for Shin now?

511
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,960
You and Shin...
the relationship of both of you..

512
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,300
What are you trying to say now?

513
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,490
You don't get it?

514
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,900
Didn't you guys have a farewell vacation already?

515
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,200
Farewell trip?

516
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,950
That's right.
Shin should think this way too.

517
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,200
He should have already tidied up his feelings.

518
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,450
Friends of the family... whatever.

519
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,780
I think I know what you are getting at.

520
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,380
But I don't want your life
to be filled with complications.

521
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,800
So are you giving me a warning now?

522
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,850
Yes. A warning.

523
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,410
Shin is married.

524
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,150
Game over.

525
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,510
Carrying on like this will only give troubles and you might hurt yourself.

526
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,920
Who is it?

527
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,750
It's Hyorin.

528
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,610
What is this?

529
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,990
While preparing the presents for the elders...

530
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,410
I prepared something simply for
the Crown Princess as well.

531
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,420
Just put it in her room.

532
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,750
Jeonha, you should give it to her personally.

533
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,000
Although you went alone...

534
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,400
Just said a word of sorry to the Crown Princess.

535
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,450
And all the stress that she had felt will be gone like a smoke..

536
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:29,430
This way it will be better for the relationship between husband and wife.

537
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,150
There is nothing to be sorry about.

538
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,790
Yes, I know.

539
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,640
Where did you buy this?

540
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,850
Don't tell me it's a gift from the Crown Prince?

541
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,850
- Maybe it's not..
- It's so pretty.

542
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,590
I will do it, Mama.

543
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,200
The vase, oh it's here.

544
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,850
Mama, let me do it.

545
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,260
Let's do it together.

546
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,420
They're really pretty!

547
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,580
Scissors... where is the scissors?

548
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,450
I think it's over there.
I'll go find.

549
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,340
Yes, Mama.

550
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,690
That guy.

551
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,940
So pretty!

552
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,750
He is sensitive after all.

553
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,880
Thanks!

554
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,130
It's so pretty. I like it so much.

555
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,870
The thing that is glowing,
is that a diamond?

556
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,470
It must have been expensive.

557
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,610
Here, put it on for me.

558
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,360
Get the Internal Officer to put it on for you.

559
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,060
Why?

560
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,850
I never ever buy gifts.

561
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,850
You should know I dislike things like that.

562
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,680
The Internal Officer prepared it.

563
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,600
Not only that, the gifts for the elders, he prepared all of that as well.

564
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,800
What's wrong with you,
you prepared this right?

565
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,340
Please tell me.
Are you embarrassed?

566
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,110
Please tell me,
you prepared this right?

567
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,150
You come over there with me.

568
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,870
After hitting you so many times,
you just don't change.

569
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,690
You come in with me.

570
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,210
When can you listen and behave?

571
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,680
Not behaving??

572
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,570
When can you behave?
