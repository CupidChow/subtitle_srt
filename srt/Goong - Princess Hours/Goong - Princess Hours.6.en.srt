00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,350
Episode 6

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,280
Hello.

3
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,390
I'm not late today, right?

4
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,620
Yes, Princess.

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,960
You arrived ten minutes early.

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,260
You didn't sleep, did you?

7
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,650
Oh? How did you know?

8
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,650
Isn't it obvious?

9
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,750
You came here with rabbit eyes.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,650
Really? Is it really red?

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,930
Is it unbearable to see?

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,580
But what are you doing?

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,550
The Prince is testing out the King's foods.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,950
This is called "ShiSun".

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,450
Oh~ ShiSun?

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,780
But why are you doing this?

17
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,470
Are you worried that there's poison?

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:37,000
It has been 10 years since Shin Goon started the "ShiSun" method when he was 9 years old.

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,350
Although it has the meaning of setting a good example through one's self.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
But still, that's too much..

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,450
It's a shock to hear that the pompous Shin had done this method for a 10 years.

22
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,950
Inside the Goong had this kind of place?

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,380
It's amazing.

24
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,090
It looks like Alice in Wonderland...

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,610
You could play treasure seeking in here.

26
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,450
Hwa Hyang Man Won Jung.
Jung Won Man.....

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,380
Hwa Hyung Man Won Jung.
Jung Won Man Hyung Hwa.

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,530
Wow. It makes sense even if it's backwards or not.

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,490
It's so amazing! If you reverse it.....

30
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,530
Ah, that's shameful..

31
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,730
Where did your sense of self-awareness go to?

32
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,830
What did you say?

33
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,180
Do you remember what I told you before?

34
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,490
I told you to upgrade your knowledge in order to live in Goong.

35
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,010
What does that have to do in this situation,
right now?

36
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,910
What I told you before was from
a little dialogue from Hamlet.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,380
Huh? Dia.....?

38
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,760
You don't need that information
when you're drawing?

39
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,720
What do you mean?

40
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,650
You may be a little talented in drawing,

41
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,380
but your basic upbringing is just too weak.
Isn't it true?

42
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,650
Forget that you didn't
read Shakespeare novels,

43
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,950
but you seem to eavesdrop
on other people like a cat.

44
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,650
Hey! What did you say?!

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,190
Upbringing?

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,250
I can't believe it.

47
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,340
Right, if you have a lot of good upbringing,

48
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,590
then why did you embarrass and ignore me in front of school friends at the party?

49
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,170
Now that I think about it,
it was all a plan, right?

50
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,810
You invited Min Hyorin and tried to make me look dumb in front of your friends.

51
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,750
If you really liked Min Hyorin, you should've done something to marry her.

52
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,230
Why did you make a lousy mistake
and acting like this now?

53
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,850
You selfish and witless guy!

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,060
What did you say?

55
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,540
What did you just say now?

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,690
You're witless and selfish, why?!

57
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,860
Listen to me carefully.

58
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,870
We are unluckily the kind of people that cannot fulfill each other's needs.

59
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,830
HOWEVER.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,050
However.

61
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,050
Saying that we have to test-taste the white lilies tea. The elders are now waiting.

62
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,450
Go prepare quickly.

63
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,380
White lilies tea?

64
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,380
What is it?

65
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,200
Princess, this is your first time with
the White lilies tea, right?

66
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,080
Yes, Mama.

67
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,900
This kind of tea...

68
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,510
I have never even seen it before.

69
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,080
It's amazing.

70
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,500
The tea book says...

71
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,320
Tea that is to be used, has the taste of preventing cold...

72
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,980
The people drinking them are the people of virtue.

73
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:34,340
Now, with the special people and special tea, accept to scent and drink.

74
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:58,520
"Sixty Windmills spin in the blink of the eyes" and "Deep peach spring colors are like the newly-weds",

75
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,490
the marriage time of 60 years
have all passed within a flash,

76
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:11,700
the peach trees shining with the colors of spring are the same newly-wed years.

77
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,070
The part that comes back
doesn't seem to be really true..

78
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,490
Leaving behind double wooden
scoop to the descendants.

79
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,350
It's the way of the life to get back together after long separation..

80
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,370
And leave the double wooden
scoop to the descendants.

81
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,490
A hundred years of long sorrow..

82
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,340
Everything seem to be woes.

83
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,020
A hundred years has passed but secular world is chaotic as before..

84
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,520
The countless images of the world have all pass over through time.

85
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,270
The scents of the flowers fill the whole garden...

86
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,110
The whole garden is filled with
the scents of flowers.

87
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,660
The flower scents fill the gardens...

88
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Garden is full of flower scent.

89
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,060
Bingung...

90
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,450
How could you pull up your dress and run?

91
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,230
I don't know what to do with her.

92
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
Prince.

93
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes, Hulma Mama.

94
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,490
The improvements that the Crown Princess is showing is like a thousand miles per day.

95
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,050
Get her familiarize with the poems and bring her to the Royal family's gatherings, the next time.

96
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,970
According to the traditions, the Crown Prince is supposed to teach his wife these poems.

97
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,240
Yes, Hulma Mama.

98
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,400
Thanks about last time.

99
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,060
Hm?

100
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,750
Hwa Hyung Man Won Jung.
Jung Won Man Hyung Hwa.

101
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,850
What are you talking about?
I can't understand anything..

102
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,750
That's right.
Our friend is slowly living in her own world.

103
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,650
Don't speak any for those outer space words..

104
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,490
Just go to the food court, I'm hungry.

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,350
Okay. I want spicy rice cake.

106
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,010
I like everything's that free.

107
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,910
Wait for me.

108
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh, my mistake!

109
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,600
What's "outer space words"?

110
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,380
Uh...it's an internet slang word.

111
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,050
It means the words you
don't understand or you....

112
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,750
Aish, it's "hella"...
Hard to explain.

113
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,140
I mean, it's really hard to explain.

114
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,050
Anyway, it's enough for you
to know these first..

115
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,020
Hey, transferred student!

116
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,650
Look like we need some word training to do.

117
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,310
Let's go!

118
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,180
Bye.

119
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,000
Unnie, give me "kimduk"
[sushi & spicy rice cake].

120
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,910
Lady, give me one 'kim bab' [sushi] and one 'dukbokee' [spicy rice cake].

121
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,100
This is the right way.
To shorten it, "kimduk".

122
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,490
one 'kim bab' [sushi] and one
'dukbokee' [spicy rice cake].

123
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,700
To shorten, it's one "kimduk".

124
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,780
That's right.

125
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,410
Now, for a little pop quiz.

126
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,870
One "mandoo" [dumpling] and one 'dukbokee' [spicy rice cake].

127
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,860
What would this be?

128
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,650
One "mandoo" [dumpling] and one 'dukbokee' [spicy rice cake].

129
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,040
One "manduk".

130
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,280
BINGO!

131
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,250
OH! Good job!

132
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,920
What a surprise, Yul!

133
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,630
You seem to get it on your head really fast.

134
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,700
Fine, next level!

135
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,750
If you do it like this,
you don't need to wash it.

136
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,090
Look at it!
Wow, isn't it amazing?!

137
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,950
Also, I'll tell you a method of getting out of gym class and other classes.

138
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,250
Open your eyes big.

139
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,420
Do it and just bear with it.

140
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,530
Then, doesn't your eyes turn bright red?

141
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,530
Then, lie and tell that
you got an eye infection.

142
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,080
And if you have a balloon, blow it up..

143
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,310
Then your face turns bright red!

144
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,170
And this is something that
you can do in daily life.

145
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,280
Beautiful Soon Young, come do an example for him to see quickly..

146
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,050
Just shut your mouth, Shin Chaegyung!

147
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,550
How can you talk about basic knowledge, when you can't even sing in the right tune?

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,350
That's right. Don't be pretentious just because you became a Princess.

149
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,500
You are like a complete idiot.

150
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,140
REFLECTION!

151
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,390
Hey, Shin Chaegyung.

152
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Are you a middle schooler?

153
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,790
This is so lame.

154
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,760
Lee Kang Hyung, reflection!

155
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,980
My Yul is here.

156
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,950
Let's go for a walk with Grandma.

157
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,710
Yes, HalmaMama.

158
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,080
Your highness! Are you all right?

159
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,160
Is your waist hurting?

160
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,710
I'm fine.

161
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,330
I'm all right, it's nothing big.

162
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,340
Queen, how are you today?

163
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,800
Yes. Are you alright as well?

164
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,280
Mama, the Shin Kyo dance culture festival's list for the people..

165
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,730
who's going to be presented the awards for the best dance technics.

166
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:52,050
We need to make the final decision.
When is the best time for us to present it?

167
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,470
We'll talk about this matter right now.

168
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,190
I think it's a good idea to
let Yul on it as well.

169
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,080
Yul can help us out if there's anything that's connected with Arts.

170
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
It's really brilliant.

171
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,620
I was very satisfied with the artist's work of art a long time ago.

172
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,250
Yul's sense for Arts is really good,
that's really not bad.

173
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,100
Yes, that's because my mom is more interested in woodcrafts.

174
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,220
Yes, so it's like that.

175
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,320
With the recommendation of the Queen and the appraisal from Yul...

176
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,680
The Royal family's special prize
will be given to this person.

177
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,230
Yes, Mama. I'll do that.

178
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:43,060
"Gyuk Pa" was a similar sport to golf that was played during the old days.

179
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:50,190
Hitting a wooden ball and letting it go through holes that are designed as pits.

180
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,350
The first person who hit the ball into the final pit is the winner..

181
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,030
Oh, I see.

182
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,750
Then it's really similar to golf.

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,390
Yes, Princess.

184
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,350
You can even say that it's the ancestor of golf.

185
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,410
It's a really popular sport in the 15th century.

186
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,500
There are also records about it during Jong Jong and Se Jong emperors' times.

187
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,300
Those records are much older than the golf history by one or two centuries.

188
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,110
Our ancestors all like playing this game.

189
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
Nice shot!

190
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,050
You have already won, Prince.

191
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,430
Try to play now.

192
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,190
Uh? M...Me?

193
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,130
Come here. Stand here.

194
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,190
Spread your legs to the shoulders width..

195
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,080
Close them a little.

196
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,450
Relax your shoulders and
don't use too much strength

197
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,620
And naturally bend your knees and hips.

198
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,300
Are you digging a land?

199
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,820
Drink your tea, Mama.

200
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,770
What were you looking at so happily?

201
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,820
I was looking at their young lives.

202
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,480
King, even though you stand in front of all the Korean citizens,

203
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,430
the only thing you that you
might desire for is this.

204
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,280
I mean their young lives that are blossomed out.

205
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,300
I see.

206
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:12,190
The memories of youth, it'll also be a beautiful memory even if there are sadness.

207
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:22,350
For some people, their memories of youth are still remaining in their hearts.

208
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,300
Hey, you have to hit it out the doors.
That way.

209
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,760
BingungMaMa!

210
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
Fighting! Fighting!~

211
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,770
Fighting!~ Fighting!~

212
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,880
IT'S IN!

213
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,750
You got it in.

214
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,050
You got it in!

215
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:09,870
Who?

216
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,360
It's in!

217
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280
It's true!

218
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,410
I did it?

219
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,850
Yeah!

220
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,460
REALLY?
Through here?

221
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,950
Like this.

222
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,700
It's really amazing!

223
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,300
Oh? Yul Goon!

224
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,970
What brings you here?

225
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,450
What do you mean? You said you'll teach me how to play hitting the ball from the horse.

226
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,190
Ah, that's right! I said that, right?

227
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,020
Should we go then?

228
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,860
Right now?

229
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,210
Uh, I can go later when you're done.

230
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,190
I was getting bored to death anyway.

231
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,780
Officer Kim,
please continue teaching the Princess.

232
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,230
The Great Queen is
looking out of the window.

233
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,630
So at least,
teach her the correct basic posture.

234
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Okay, Prince.

235
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,210
Let's go.

236
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,080
It doesn't matter how many
times you touch the channel,

237
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,770
you get disqualified when
you hit the horse or your opponent.

238
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,490
When there's a ball in front of you,
it's important to get it first.

239
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,350
And then, think about where to hit it.

240
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,750
That's the tips.

241
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,950
This is to hit at the center core of the ball.

242
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,080
Should we play now?

243
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,980
Let's go back.

244
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,550
Shin has go back on his promise to meet up.

245
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,190
I skipped dance lessons for this as well..

246
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,190
All right.
I'll call later for the Seoul club.

247
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,130
It's a relief that Chaegyung's in my class.

248
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,350
Because of her,
I got used to the school environment.

249
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,170
And made new friends.

250
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,050
But I think you need to be
careful with what you say.

251
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,950
It's okay between us, but be careful in front of the parents when you say "Chaegyung".

252
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,750
Especially, in front of the queen.

253
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,920
I feel really depressed.

254
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,180
That's right,
or else I'll be corrected by mom again.

255
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,040
I got it.

256
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,940
I'll paid attention.

257
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,120
Okay.

258
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,120
Do you want to start again?

259
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,410
Okay.

260
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,450
The world's famous people
gathered where the Prince is.

261
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,860
OH?! The pig in on TV!

262
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,190
DAD!

263
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,870
Where? Where?
Mom, come out now!

264
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,100
The Princess became so pretty! She must like living in the Palace.

265
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,010
Look at her raise her hand.

266
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,890
It looks like she practiced a lot for the past days.

267
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,890
She's good.

268
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,100
Hah! The pig transformed!

269
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,780
Hey! What do you mean by transformed?!

270
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,990
She just probably did a little bit of make-up.

271
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,450
She put something on her face anyway.

272
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,210
That's all fake!

273
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:24,110
The main theme for this art exhibition is the Royal family with exhibits from all over the country.

274
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,770
At the opening of the Royal Art museum...

275
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,230
Shin Goon and I were invited to cut the ribbon.

276
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,670
WOW! It's such an honor to do this in front of many people that I've only seen on TV before.

277
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,870
Especially a person like me who goes to an arts school.

278
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,780
I was already getting hyped up.

279
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,250
Prince.

280
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:59,450
It seems like you need to take some time taking pictures from the reporters because of the art museum opening.

281
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Hey, look over here! Here! Here!

282
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,300
Put that hand down. It's lame.

283
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,050
If I don't do this, then the one in the pictures isn't me.

284
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,380
What's with it?!

285
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,190
Are you okay?

286
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,850
Prince!

287
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,290
Protect both of them back to the Palace.

288
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,260
Take the Prince! Hurry up take him!

289
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,790
How can the Prince's bodyguard be so careless?

290
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,810
What have those bodyguards been eating?

291
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,470
How can they let the Prince get hit by the egg in front of millions of people?

292
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm sorry, my King.

293
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,890
It must because you reduced his bodyguards to three.

294
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,780
And so, there's a leak hole in the securities..

295
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,150
To catch the offender, the Prime Minister is giving out the orders personally.

296
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,730
The securities of the Eastern Palace has been doubled to protect the Crown Prince.

297
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,750
And we are now on red alert..

298
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,780
The Prince is now resting in the Eastern Palace.

299
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,340
And he has refused to make any contact with the outside world, Mama..

300
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,920
All right. You can go now.

301
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,830
Yes, Queen.

302
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,810
Is it true that the Princess Mom,
came out and blocked the eggs with her hands?

303
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,660
Yes, Mama.

304
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,050
Oh... how could this thing happen?

305
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,270
We must have to find who threw the eggs as soon as possible.

306
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,280
The Prime Minister is doing it personally.

307
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,450
So, I hope it'll be announced soon.

308
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,150
The election meeting for the future King is coming soon.

309
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,730
You have to try hard to calm the Prince down.

310
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,150
Yes, Mama.

311
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,310
The media seem to be leaning in pity towards the Crown Prince.

312
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,880
What should I do?

313
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,270
The plan seems to go in the wrong direction than what I had expected.

314
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,740
No. We have to be satisfied with this.

315
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,450
Although he has the upperhands now because of pity...

316
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,650
But after some time, the media will slowly change their opinions about the Prince.

317
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,450
They'll start to wonder what bad points does he has to be thrown eggs at?

318
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,650
I'll be the one with the upperhands
when that happens.

319
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,280
Anyway, there are also people that are being suspicious now. .

320
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:49,400
Is that proud and aloof Prince capable of being in the King's place, right now?

321
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,120
Let's not talk about that first..

322
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,050
I heard that the Prime Minister has given definite orders to catch the offender.

323
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,000
Will there be any problems for that?

324
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,780
Who am I?
You don't have to worry.

325
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,800
Whoever it was, if I find them,
they're dead!

326
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,910
How could they...?!

327
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,780
How shocked must he be?

328
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,350
No.. I can't do it..

329
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,750
I must go and see with my
own eyes how he's feeling.

330
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,610
It's better for you, not to go.

331
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,050
You don't know anything about Shin's pride?

332
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,850
Since he was young, he doesn't like to hear any negative comments from people.

333
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,790
And that guy, on live TV...

334
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,450
was hit by eggs and was made
so dirty and pitiful...

335
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,450
Don't you know the shock that he has to endure?

336
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm just telling you this just in case something bad happens when you talk to Shin.

337
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,650
I got rejected by him as well
when I went to his room.

338
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,650
Really?

339
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,890
I think the best solution now is
to let him be alone for awhile.

340
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:31,270
But I can't forget he expression on his face when he got hit by the egg.

341
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,570
He doesn't look angry.

342
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,340
It was as if he was out of sorts.

343
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,700
While I was saying this, a feeling just rose from the bottom of my heart.

344
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,050
It's like a strange kind of feeling oozing out of me.

345
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,190
It's as if...

346
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,050
You feel lonely right?

347
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,620
Even if you looked carefree and
cheerful on the surface,

348
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,590
But I know it isn't like that.

349
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,700
Cheer up.

350
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,000
Thanks.

351
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,250
I think I'd better look for Shin Goon now.

352
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,490
It doesn't matter if I get chased out by him.

353
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,220
I just want to know if he is all right and I want to see it with my own eyes.

354
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,290
Doesn't this makes him angry?

355
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,360
If...

356
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,670
it was Hyorin, I think it will be better.

357
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:54,890
No matter what Shin Goon thinks,
I am after all his wife now.

358
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,350
At times like this, especially after what he had been through today,

359
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,290
I feel that I should be by his side.

360
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,280
Why do I feel like crying all of a sudden?

361
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,570
Where did you go?

362
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,450
What happened?
Are you crying?

363
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,020
Is your face all right?

364
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,430
Of course, getting hit by an egg is
not going to kill me, right?

365
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,300
I guess you are really okay.

366
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,840
I thought you'd be...

367
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,610
Actually this is the first time I had encountered things like this. I was a bit shocked.

368
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,510
Also I am afraid that people
around me will be judgmental...

369
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,280
but at the same time none of them are willing to come any closer.

370
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,580
At this point, you could have come.

371
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,820
Aren't you good at it?

372
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,960
Not able to judge the situation and always spoiling the atmosphere.

373
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,690
Actually I hoped that you would
come over and do that.

374
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,430
I thought perhaps things would
be better if you did that.

375
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,310
Well you are really embarrassing.

376
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,880
Openly laughing and playing with your cousin-in-law in front of the guards.

377
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,750
I think I'd better go to the
horse riding club ranch.

378
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,400
I am sorry.

379
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,770
Sorry.

380
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,630
So you feel guilty now for enjoying your time with your cousin-in-law, right?

381
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,400
What?

382
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,190
No wonder you got egged.

383
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,080
You are like a bowl of Shin ramen
with an additional egg!

384
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,870
So this is the horse riding club?

385
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,450
It is so different. We actually have a place like this in the country?

386
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,110
I want to be alone.
You return to the Palace first.

387
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,310
We are leaving now, Mama.

388
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,910
Okay.

389
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,900
I... I am not going back to the Palace, please bring me to the school.

390
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,780
Oh, the Crown Prince is here.

391
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,080
Come over quickly,
Ryu Hwan is sleeping.

392
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,290
He really can sleep anywhere.

393
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Anyways, if this goes on,
wouldn't the duck become a swan?

394
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,890
You'd think just anyone can turn into a swan?

395
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,450
She is... a commoner.

396
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,350
If you look from top to bottom, head to toe, and from in through out, she is totally, completely, a commoner.

397
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,780
There is a way for a duck to become a swan.

398
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,150
Reincarnate. Get reincarnated!

399
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,760
Hey, rich kids.

400
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,170
Do you want me to tell you guys the way to change from "Shing Gu" to "Sheng Gu"?

401
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,040
Reincarnate. Get reincarnated.

402
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,550
Go back home, go through the calendar,
and pick a date.

403
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,250
It's 2006 already.

404
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,250
We talked insults on your wife.
You don't like it, right?

405
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,550
I know you're not a person who'd want to depend on parents, nor you're snobby and conceited.

406
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,650
As to what you have said about the 21st century, there is no such thing as pure royal blood anymore.

407
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,540
But I can't accept that.

408
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,970
No. I dislike the fact.

409
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,310
Someone who comes up with different poses in front of the camera.

410
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,310
Someone who has no taste and childish.

411
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,180
Didn't you say that I have to be by your side?

412
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,100
Someone who does not have the right is by your side, that makes me angry.

413
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,750
I can't accept that.

414
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,920
Should practice a little while more.

415
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,750
You still want to go?

416
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,630
Who is that?

417
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,850
Wait! Wait!!

418
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,650
Sister!!

419
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,350
They are my friends!

420
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,370
Of course, yes.
Don't worry about it.

421
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,070
Sister.

422
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,600
We will keep in contact.

423
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,140
- Sister, congratulations.
- Thank you.

424
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,610
But it's a bit smaller than I thought.

425
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,710
I never thought of earning money,
it's just an interest.

426
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,920
Oh we meet outside the
hotel the other time.

427
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,560
My beloved student.
Future ballet star. Min Hyorin.

428
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,330
Come to think, Hyorin's your direct junior.

429
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,600
Hyorin won the first prize in the international ballet competition.

430
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,000
Unnie, you were good as
well during high school.

431
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,940
Is it? Where was it held?

432
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,310
I think they change the venue every year.

433
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,980
Bangkok. Bangkok, Thailand.

434
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,280
Is it?
I guess it's a bit late but still congratulations.

435
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,350
Thank you.

436
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,750
This is for the opening of your yoga center.

437
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,960
Wow, it's so beautiful.

438
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,760
Thank you.

439
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,530
You look so pretty,
really look like a celebrity.

440
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,040
It's her.
There are no mistakes.

441
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,880
You've met her before?

442
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,450
Yes. She is Yul's friend.
We've met once before.

443
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,760
I never thought she was the same like me.

444
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
How can such a thing happen?

445
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,730
Spread your knees and legs.

446
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,230
And slowly straighten your legs.

447
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,510
Breathe out.

448
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,890
Your pelvis on that side is a bit crooked.

449
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,520
How did you know?

450
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,460
People who dances ballet show case their body and they seem so confident about it.

451
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,130
But you are careless with yours.

452
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,960
It maybe look flexible.

453
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,930
But no one will notice that it
suffers from all kinds of injures.

454
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,170
If you want to cure the crookedness, we would have to meet frequently.

455
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,040
Yes. I will try my best.

456
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,150
Whenever I see you,
it reminds me of the past.

457
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:35,120
To become the Crown Princess, I gave up my dream. I used to be a ballet dancer who has a lot of opportunities.

458
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,060
It's as if I am looking at my 19 yrs old self again. It's the same.

459
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,830
It will be great if someone like you became the Crown Princess.

460
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,870
You have a nice bone structure,
a really elegant look.

461
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,780
The choosing of the Crown Princess wasn't conducted seriously.

462
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,550
This is just my opinion, don't be mistaken.

463
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,830
It's Sunday today.
What are you doing in school?

464
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,000
I miss you guys.

465
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,000
That hat is really beautiful.
Can you let me wear it for just once?

466
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:36,950
I like the gloves.
Very elegant and luxurious.

467
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,550
Did you know, Hwang Tei Jia Bin Mama, you became the no. 1 search in the internet?

468
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,890
What do you mean?

469
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,960
You even have a fan club. There were more than 100,000 members within a few days.

470
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,960
Just today, there are thousands of people joining. Thousands and thousands.

471
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,270
You know what is the name of your fanclub?
"Cinderella Chaegyung"

472
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,700
Sounds cool?

473
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,170
Then.. do I have to meet the fans?

474
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,940
Hey, don't be too smug about it.

475
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,050
You also have an anti-fan club which
has 50,000 members.

476
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,420
Anti?

477
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,550
What have I done wrong?

478
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,550
There are 2 different reasons of the ANTI.

479
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,230
First, it's the rumors that causes the ANTI.

480
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,530
Second, basically your existence causes the ANTI.

481
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,800
Then what am I?
What is the real reason?

482
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,370
You are so ordinary and yet you are married to the Crown Prince.

483
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,240
That's right.

484
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,350
Be careful.
If the ANTI club catches you, you're finished.

485
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,450
What have I done wrong? I don't want to live under anyone's threat.

486
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,190
I will live by my own rules.

487
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,460
As for those ANTI,
or whatever, I am not afraid.

488
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
Mama, it is time to return to the Palace.

489
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,230
I want to stay a bit longer.

490
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,810
Please keep the hat.

491
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,210
Here is the expensive gloves.

492
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,280
It's okay.
You guys keep them.

493
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,390
Really?

494
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:33,060
Hey. What?
I don't wear these things.

495
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,080
Chaegyung, thank you.

496
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,580
Come back again when you have the time.

497
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,380
Bodyguard goodbye!
Bye-bye!

498
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,350
Mama.

499
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,940
What is it?

500
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:03,670
It's about Tei Sang Gong Mama.

501
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,840
What about her?

502
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,280
She opened a yoga center and
the grand opening was today.

503
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,250
You only received the news now?

504
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,020
I am sorry Mama.

505
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:21,120
The rest of the royals are also very secretive about it.

506
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:27,700
She should have entered the Palace upon her return and send regards to the royals.

507
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,370
What is up in her sleeves to
want to hide her trails?

508
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,240
Wow. Really pretty.

509
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,210
Not everyone can carry off this hairdo,

510
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,700
but it really suits you.

511
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,420
Hello.
You are really handsome.

512
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,020
Oh my, oh my.
The result is really good.

513
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,790
I want to redo it.

514
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,490
Eh? Redo it?

515
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,200
I don't want it elegant.
I want the natural look.

516
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,880
For today's party, all the different ambassadors from different countries

517
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,760
came to send regards to the newly wedded Royal Prince and Princess.

518
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,130
Naturally, the star of the party is
of course Shin and me.

519
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,760
And it is open to the important press in the country.

520
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,100
Shin and I are going to be on the headlines.

521
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,100
I am really nervous.

522
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,700
I told you to be careful.

523
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,800
I know. I'll try my best.

524
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,430
I didn't really keep in contact and only came to send my regards now.

525
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,800
Please forgive me Mama.

526
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,710
DaeJaBin, Bingung...

527
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,580
Yes, Mama.

528
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:03,550
I actually thought of the past.
I have misspoken.

529
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:08,790
At least you came back before I die.
That's fortunate.

530
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,630
The time has come for the royals to move towards a new era.

531
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:20,070
Everyone in the Royal family has gathered today, this really calls for celebration.

532
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:30,210
If the decreased King saw this, he would have been very happy.

533
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:53,100
What is she scheming now, to have chosen today to return to the Palace?

534
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:00,680
Hye Jung Goong is the same as well, she can't carry that thorn in her heart forever.

535
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,680
There was no news of her for 14 years, and why as if on purpose,

536
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,590
she chose the time where we are all worried for your health to come back.

537
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:14,690
Also, she chose today, which is the day where the newlywed Royal Couple appear together in public.

538
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,400
Acting as if this is her party.
Is it not?

539
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,140
Don't want to.

540
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,170
Get up quickly darn it.

541
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,250
Nothing could have been
done to prevent that tragedy.

542
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:48,510
I hope that you can forget the past, and only think of the future , Hae Jung Goong.

543
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:53,720
I heard from Yul, that you are having problems with your back.

544
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,220
Yes, neither the western nor the han physicians can find out what's wrong.

545
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,360
The pain gets worse.

546
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,860
Perhaps it's not the back, the problem maybe lying on the spine bones.

547
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,930
Do you feel faint and
have symptoms of anemia?

548
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:17,040
Actually, because the King's
health is always good until now.

549
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:22,190
So the reason for the
Crown Prince's rushed marriage...

550
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,450
Is the King's health? Mama?

551
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,150
I guess you can say that.

552
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:37,330
No matter what,
I still want to do a bit of exercise.

553
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,170
Then, would you like to give yoga a try, Mama?

554
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,970
Yoga?

555
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,270
That's really beautiful. Isn't that really beauti...

556
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,470
I'm sorry, so sorry.

557
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,780
My shoe?

558
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,300
Don't move.

559
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,480
Turn around.

560
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,750
Am I really that obvious?

561
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,320
There are two of us.

562
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,050
There's only one single bed.

563
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,450
Why... why...
are you taking off your clothes?

564
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,540
Are you okay, Yul Goon??

565
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:11,530
You're bleeding!

566
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,820
Get out!

567
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,150
Welcome Prince William!

568
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:27,080
For this trip, everything will be taken care of by our Crown Princess.

569
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,280
Hello. I heard that the two of them are coming to my house so I prepared a present.

570
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,250
If this goes on,
will I lose control and pounce on him?
