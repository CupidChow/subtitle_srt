00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,340
Episode 15

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,020
It's okay!

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,420
Get in.

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,470
Where are we going?

5
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,390
Do you know how worried I was?

6
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,470
You didn't even bring the bodyguards,
I thought that you might got into an accident.

7
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,570
Thanks for actually worrying about me.

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,550
Don't be hurt because of
those meaningless pictures.

9
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,600
Meaningless pictures?

10
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,800
You really don't have any seriousness inside you.

11
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:09,420
Even if it's not me,
I thought you'd be more worried about Hyorin.

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,390
You probably really never had
a serious relationship with anyone.

13
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,260
Are you kidding me? At least to you....

14
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,170
I really feel sorry for butting
into the relationship between you two.

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,510
When I moved to the Palace,
I needed someone to rely on.

16
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,450
No matter how cruel you were
and how mean you acted,

17
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,620
sometimes when you were beside me, I was happy and sometimes it gave me courage.

18
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,490
But now, I no longer feel that way.

19
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,400
What do you mean?

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,900
I feel exhausted standing by your side.

21
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,010
Where are you going!?

22
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,220
You said to wait for 2 to 3 years.

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, let's divorce after 2 to 3 years.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,600
What?! What if I refuse to?

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,010
I'm not a doll who will follow all of your bidding.

26
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,610
So, those days that you wanted to go to Hyorin,

27
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,350
I think it's better to respect each other's limits. Or else...

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,860
We might...
We might want to forget the past memories we had.

29
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,450
If being under the same sky and
standing in the same land...

30
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,500
makes me grow hatred for you...

31
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,950
Then it will be hard for me to handle.

32
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,080
Is living inside the Palace that hard for you?

33
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,390
If you really want a divorce, then I'll divorce you.

34
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,730
Who brought up the divorce first, you jerk!

35
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,150
Because I didn't like you at first.

36
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Why did some random girl butt into my life...
and with her big staring eyes, asking me this and that.

37
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,150
When I listen to your words,
it felt like my life was all fake.

38
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:53,000
All the things that I once believed were real,
felt fake within seconds.

39
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,760
But sometimes I think about this often.
But sometime, I would ask myself...

40
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Will I be able to live without you?

41
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,300
That means... could it...?

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,650
All in all, I bet I could live without you.

43
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,450
People will always get adapted to
the new environment slowly.

44
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,820
I lived without you for 19 years,
I could get used to my normal life without you.

45
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,350
But I might miss your presence.

46
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,100
Because of you I was tired, fought with you and all those time when we made up,

47
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,300
I think it became a habit now.

48
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,480
Like as if I don't do something that
I haven't done daily, I feel empty.

49
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,700
So that's it. You can fix habits.

50
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,790
How do you fix habits?

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,290
You should at least tell me how before you leave.

52
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,990
I don't know, a know-it-all like you should
go and find it out yourself.

53
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,170
You don't even have a single bit of sincerity, you standard non-cell biological animal!

54
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,370
What are you doing? Let go!

55
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,050
Just for a while...

56
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,450
Can you stay like this just for a while...?

57
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,750
Do you remember?
It's the Prince's first born clothing.

58
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Mama... you still kept this?

59
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:50,730
The clothes that the Prince first wore when he was born, I was joyous that I handmade this.

60
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,430
Yes, Mama.

61
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,310
He was so small.

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,310
Then one day he spent the night together with his wife, the feeling is really different.

63
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,110
Don't you think so, Hwang-Hu?

64
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,910
Yes, Mama.

65
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,390
Now, after one year,
we might see the royal grandchild.

66
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,050
Yes, Mama.

67
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,690
When that time comes, you can pass this on.

68
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,460
Instead of me giving this,
I think it's better for you to give this to her.

69
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,400
Mama...

70
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,970
Do you think her stomach will
start showing anytime soon?

71
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,810
Mama, you're too fast!

72
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,280
So what?

73
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,410
There's a saying that we might as well throw a banquet while Tteokbokgi is being made.

74
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,230
Hyorin, what are you looking at
instead of hanging up the clothes?

75
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,740
The sky is so clear.

76
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,140
It is. It looks like my Hyorin.

77
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,910
Really?

78
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,350
The sky looks so clear and pure,
just like my daughter.

79
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,290
How's the lesson fee?

80
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,430
Teacher paid it for me. Don't worry.

81
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,370
How thankful.
How could we ever pay this kindness to her?

82
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,700
When I become a ballerina, I'll pay all the debt.

83
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,210
Let's go inside, it's cold.

84
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,560
Where did you go...?

85
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,870
What's wrong with you?
Did something happen?

86
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
No.

87
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,370
-Yul!
-Mom.

88
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,840
I feel tired today. I want to sleep.

89
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,390
Wow! Look at the stars,
it looks like it is going to fall down.

90
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,030
For stars, they have their own time. Just like as people's world has it's own time as well.

91
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,770
Wow! Shin Goon, how do you know those stuff?

92
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,970
Yah, read some books! Books!
It's from my favorite short novel.

93
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:55,280
According to the book, just like how most of the planets have their own revolving cycles.

94
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,420
Humans, too, have their time of death.

95
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,090
In 2,500 years.

96
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,790
Starting from now when 2,500 years pass by,

97
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,450
all the things we are struggling now,
we will struggle it again later

98
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,900
and we will meet the same people we met before.

99
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,170
Then if we go by the book,
we will meet again after 2,500 years?

100
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
Most likely.

101
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,110
Shin Goon would probably not want to see me again.

102
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,180
No. I think I would want to meet you again.

103
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,320
If I'm with you, I don't think I'm going to be bored.
I hate being bored.

104
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,600
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

105
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,470
This is why you can't.
This is why it's fun to play around with you.

106
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Oh! my gosh!
You!

107
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,610
You just wait!

108
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,220
I found it.

109
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,390
-Hey!
-You come here!

110
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,320
Don't do it, you'll go to jail immediately.

111
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,960
-It's okay! I don't care if I'm going to jail.
-You just wait!

112
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,830
Let's die together!

113
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,000
Yah! Ah, I'm sorry! I made a mistake!

114
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:33,050
No, why our Prince would hit Hwi Sung Dae Goon?
What happened actually?

115
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:40,750
Pardon me, I am not too sure about the actual situation between Taeja Mama and Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama..

116
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,990
-They seem to have some arguments.
-What sort of arguments?

117
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm not too sure about that.

118
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,230
I must summon the Prince and ask him in detail.
Tell the Prince to come right away!

119
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,540
Yes, Mama.

120
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,070
Hwang-Hu Mama,
Hye Jung Jong said to stop by her place.

121
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,920
What is happening?

122
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,620
Mama, Hwang-Hu Mama has been
called to Hye Jung Jong's place.

123
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,130
He was the royal grandson since he was born.

124
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,600
If Crown Hyo Ryul hasn't pass away, he'll now be sitting on the Crown Prince position.

125
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,110
I'm sorry.
I'll make sure something like this will never happen.

126
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,280
Just because he's the Prince, does Yul have to get hit like that by the Crown Prince?

127
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,860
Since the Prince is still young,
please be more understanding.

128
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:56,800
Do you think I can take this situation lightly?
I will never forget about this incident!

129
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,300
The Queen is leaving.

130
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,800
Didn't you hear?! The Queen is leaving!

131
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,780
Is he out of his mind?
Just when the rumors are all over the place.

132
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:22,120
Wait, Father!
Since we didn't hear the details, I'll find out.

133
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,060
Why is more tiring to raise him alone
than to raise ten others?

134
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,500
Getting into trouble here and there...

135
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,930
It's probably nothing. Guys at those age are like that. They might have fought over what they said.

136
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,170
We must go to the Palace right now. Pack your things.

137
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,650
Father, we should we hear what Shin has to say first since your health is still in not good condition.

138
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,450
I have left the palace for too long.

139
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,930
My handsome Prince,
what happened to your face?

140
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,330
The news article on the internet, did you do it?

141
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,370
Why do you think I did it?

142
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,000
Cause it's strange how the problem
that happened inside the Palace got out.

143
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:21,950
It's not me. A dumb photographer took pictures and he posted the pictures on his site.

144
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:30,260
What a clumsy boy!
But don't you think that the heaven is helping us?

145
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,560
It's alright even if I'm involved?

146
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:40,270
Don't you worry about anything. The royal family will not announce it publicly. It's still a rumor so...

147
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,730
There wouldn't be too much of an attack.

148
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,270
It's only that the Crown Prince who is treated like skies have acted so violently.

149
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,170
Wouldn't that be a very big blow
towards the Crown Prince's image?

150
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,440
It just might be quiet down eventually.

151
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,750
Would it? There are already talks about the Crown Prince's character problems.

152
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,520
Among the rumors, there are talks that the royal couple are not on good terms.

153
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,700
It's only a matter of time before
they abolish the Crown Prince.

154
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,290
The King has also returned to the palace.

155
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,730
This is the first history ever that a Crown Prince acts violently.

156
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,080
The great Prince should be taught a lesson, right?

157
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,780
Where are you going?

158
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,410
I'm also at fault.

159
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:40,930
Let's sit down! Why is it so quiet?
Let's see who cut the class.

160
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,630
-Kim Mi Nam!
-Yes.

161
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,930
-Da Ji Young?
-Yes.

162
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,930
-Lee Suh Gin?
-Yes.

163
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,470
Shin Chaegyung?

164
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,500
Shin Chaegyung.

165
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,310
Bingung Mama!

166
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Yes?

167
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,610
You don't answer if you're not called by "Princess".

168
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,450
-Jung Soo Ah?
-Yes.

169
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,220
- Kim Soon Young!
-Yes.

170
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:15,160
Normally, when you add English to the behind of Greek... It means turn and change. After that we'll now find...

171
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,400
Hey!

172
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,070
Did you read the article?

173
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,070
I'm also wondering what's going on.

174
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,510
Then Yul Goon, is that why he didn't come?

175
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,510
Why did they fight?

176
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,720
It's that... there was a misunderstanding.

177
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,390
Hey, Princess!
I beg you to be more attentive towards studying.

178
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,260
And while we're at it, read the first question.

179
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,890
Yeah?

180
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,550
Hello, Kwak Sang Gong unni.

181
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,060
Bingung mama, what are you doing here?

182
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,060
It's because Yoon Goon didn't go to school.
I want to know where is he feeling unwell.

183
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,870
Yoon Goon is inside, right?
I want to take a look at him before leaving.

184
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:34,410
I'm very sorry, Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama has already given orders that he doesn't want to meet anyone.

185
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,310
But, if you tell him that it's me who requests to see him,
he might agree.

186
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,610
Can you help me pass him this message?

187
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,620
Tae-Hu Mama too,
went back without even meeting him either.

188
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm really sorry, Mama.

189
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,060
Ok... so...

190
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,200
Please, you must help me pass the message?

191
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,930
I made a trip to Yul Goon's place, just now.
But he doesn't want to meet anyone at all.

192
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,870
He didn't attend school and
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

193
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,570
Would it be that he got hurt really bad?

194
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,670
Maybe he's busy.

195
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Jeonha, Pyeha has requested for you
to go to the Inner palace.

196
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,480
What is the Myung Seon Dang use for?

197
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,280
What? Why do you ask?

198
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,420
It's the first time that I know such a place existed in the palace.

199
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,760
It's seems to be a personal book warehouse.

200
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,160
Who was the person who used that place before?

201
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,200
That's only...
The place used for leisure purposes within the palace.

202
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,740
Is that so?

203
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,810
Then, how did Hwi Sung Dae Goon
get to know about that place?

204
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,510
Hwi Sung Dae Goon Mama often go to that place?

205
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,020
No, let's go.

206
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,450
Why must you treat Hwi Sung Dae Goon that way?

207
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,390
I don't want to do a detailed explanation.

208
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,860
Are you so impatient that you
don't even want to say things clearly?

209
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,830
Everything is all my fault.

210
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,030
You are the person to succeed
the Royal position in the future.

211
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,280
I have been teaching you to careful about your ways and actions since you were young,

212
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,970
how can you be doing things so irrationally?

213
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm really sorry.

214
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,980
How many times have I been teaching you about the ways of the enlightened king?

215
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,010
So why are you behaving even worse
than those trades people?

216
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,680
You can only blame that my inborn conduct is dishonorable.

217
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,350
How dare you!

218
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,430
Do you think that you still have
the qualifications to be the Crown Prince?

219
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,700
Abamama, you are always speaking in such a naturally way.

220
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:52,600
You don't need to worry. There are lots more people beside me who can succeed the royal position.

221
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,410
What are you speaking about?

222
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,940
Your son, is going to leave now.

223
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,150
Maybe..

224
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,390
The scandal this time,
has started because of the Crown Princess?

225
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,760
No.

226
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,190
The Prince's rebelling heart is getting more and more serious. It really worries me.

227
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,930
This is a common thing happening for
the children around the Prince's age.

228
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,270
If the King can be more concern
and more gentle towards him.

229
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,670
He will change for sure.

230
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm worried because I didn't see any change in his behavior, isn't that so?

231
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,120
Why does the Queen have the unspeakable injustice look each time I mention about the Prince?

232
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,720
The Prince has become so
uncontrollable because of your shielding.

233
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,490
As to where the problem came from?
You should see clearly the core of it as well.

234
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,400
The Prince's problem is not only purely the rebellious psychology state of growing up.

235
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,110
The tragedy that occurred because of an evil fate should also have a ending for me.

236
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,750
What are you talking about?

237
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,650
After the act of violence incident...

238
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,730
The people will be doubtful about the Prince's abilities and there are also signs of abolishment showing.

239
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,840
Pyeha, as long as it's the Constitutional Monarchy rules country, these problems will always exist.

240
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,880
That's right.

241
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,650
To have the Royal family existing in the real society, maybe it's already a contradicting element on itself.

242
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,620
And so.

243
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,590
It shouldn't be that the King rules the world but the royal family that's moving along with times.

244
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,290
What the citizens want is the Royal family that's close and democratic.

245
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,350
I have been thinking a lot lately.

246
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,540
If the Crown Prince can actually
take over the duties of the king.

247
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,950
For the Prince, I have already done my advising.

248
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,380
So just temporarily observe him for this period of time.

249
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,350
The medicine is getting cold, Pyeha.

250
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,430
This is really... He really pulled a straight punch.

251
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,400
What actually happened?

252
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,470
How can this be possible? This act of violence is too embarrassing. What am I supposed to tell my classmates?

253
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,710
Hey, is that a problem?

254
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,250
Honey, do you think that
the Crown Prince has a violent streak?

255
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,990
No, it's just the opposite.
He's calm, steady and have charisma.

256
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,230
Anyway, he's that kind of person. He doesn't seem like a person that will play rough.

257
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,960
That's right, Brother-in-law is such a person.

258
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,300
Even so, he may have full of violence inside of him as well.

259
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,470
That's true.

260
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,440
We can never judge anybody by their appearances.

261
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,770
-Oh my...
-What

262
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,070
-Oh my, it's serious.
-Why?

263
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,210
What are we going to do?
Our Chaegyung.

264
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,540
What about Chaegyung?

265
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,050
Abusive husband!

266
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,120
Among the rich and knowledgeable people, aren't there abusive husbands who love to beat on their wives?

267
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,750
Maybe.. he could be those type of people?

268
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,690
What?
Beating our Chaegyung?!

269
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,870
No! No!
Chaegyung! It's really!

270
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,950
Do you think that our Chaegyung will suffer silently?!

271
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,310
Oh my...

272
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,830
It'll turn out to be this sort of story, right?

273
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,170
That's right, of course..
It'll be that way, of course.

274
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,010
Anyway, our parents are still too barbaric.

275
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,340
That's why I said that your inner world is too unique.

276
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,780
- Anyway for that part.
-The End!

277
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,710
Aja!

278
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,150
How is your health?

279
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,360
It has taken a very good turn.
So please don't worry, Uhma Mama.

280
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,500
I was so worried that your health will be affected when such a scandal occurred.

281
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,700
Now, compared to my health, I'm more worried about the Crown Prince's problem.

282
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,410
The talks of the Crown Prince has
already all kinds of wide-divided opinions.

283
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,780
How about opening a press conference to explain everything?

284
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,350
Father.

285
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,390
There's a saying that, "There seems to be no road in front but hopes are in the turning corner".

286
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,390
Instead of giving an explanation, how about attending a public event as naturally as possible?

287
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,400
Public event?

288
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,300
The reporters will also be there as well.

289
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,340
If the royal family appeared to be unruffled, the public will start to forget as well.

290
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,180
What a coincidence, the French ambassador has sent a invitations to the couple for tomorrow's event.

291
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
Since the Prince is already now in such a situation,
we can't accept it.

292
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,320
Father, there is still not too much concern among the media.

293
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,390
It'll be much better if they appear together
as always during this time.

294
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,290
Then they should go,
just do according to what HaeMyung had said.

295
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,280
There's going to be a featured article this time as well.

296
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,150
I should have really slimmed down my face in advance.

297
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,350
Mama, where do you have extra fat on you?

298
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,720
To be honest, my face looks like the moon when I look at myself and it's the round full moon.

299
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,760
Right now, isn't it also round and round...
I like half moon.

300
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,030
To be honest...
Last time, when you lost appetite..

301
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,370
The look of your slim down face was just right.

302
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Then, now should I start starving myself?
But lately, I feel that my appetite is really great.

303
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,750
Then, let's fight the fat starting from today.

304
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,020
Fight the fat!

305
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,250
What?

306
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,220
Oh my, oh my...

307
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,950
What are you doing early in the morning?
You don't look so good.

308
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
Yah! I am talking to you. You!

309
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,910
Why... It will be good for you when I become pretty.

310
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,320
We are a set.

311
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,550
I dislike women who resemble a Egyptian mummy.

312
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,150
You told me to slim down the other time.

313
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,560
You should take the chance to tone up your body as well for the sake of looking photogenic? How about that?

314
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,040
Where else do I have to tone up?
I am perfect as it is.

315
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,180
What?

316
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,330
It's the Prince "syndrome" again.

317
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,300
That's right. You should start twisting already.

318
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,420
I almost died while carrying you back the other time.

319
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,810
You don't have to worry!
Sister, what are you doing. Do it together.

320
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,760
1million 21, 1million 22

321
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,830
You should shed off the fats on your face.

322
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,400
- Sister, you should shed the fats off your eyes.
- No no no no... Concentrate!

323
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,790
I have no interests in classical music.

324
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,220
Smile.

325
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,980
Yah! Wake up.

326
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,620
There are a lot of people looking at us.

327
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,090
I know.

328
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,920
These music are totally lullabies.

329
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,280
You have to bear with it.

330
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,080
I can't tonight.

331
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,360
I have to go to the bathroom.

332
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,150
Be quiet.

333
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,290
This is like sleeping pills.

334
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,370
How long more does this have to go on?

335
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,580
How... What is this...

336
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,110
What's wrong with this?

337
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
What am I going to do??!

338
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,680
There are so many reporters, so embarrassing.

339
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,760
Can it be glued back like this?

340
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,550
Stick back. Stick back.

341
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,900
Shin Chaegyung.

342
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,650
Shin Chaegyung!

343
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,170
I am here.

344
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,310
What are you doing. I thought you ran away.

345
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,180
It's ending soon. Come out quick.

346
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,010
I can't.

347
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,140
Stick back. Stick back. Please stick back.

348
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,580
Why.

349
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,800
Can't you see?

350
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,810
There are so many people outside. What to do?

351
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,900
Yah! It will totally be ruined like that!

352
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,750
The reporters will come dashing over...

353
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,190
there is no other choice.

354
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,980
Take it off.

355
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,480
What?

356
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,530
But why did you think I ran away?

357
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,510
When you make up your mind, you are the kind of person that will ran away anytime

358
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,510
Say something.

359
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,160
Regarding the recent violent incident,
please comment.

360
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,990
Oh no...

361
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,330
It's friendship between guys that has gone a bit overboard.

362
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,730
Then, regarding "Problems between the couple"?

363
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,500
Don't forget we are still newlyweds.

364
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,070
Oh.. He is really good at adapting to situations.

365
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,110
Then can you make pose for
the morning papers tomorrow?

366
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,270
Yes. Then, this is it.

367
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,420
TaeJa did not follow the rules and
the manners of a Crown Prince.

368
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,780
It is really not of the manners and
the rules of the royals, Mama.

369
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,160
Can't you see it, Hwang-Hu?

370
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,070
Sharing a room finally worked!

371
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,060
That's right, Mother.

372
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:50,200
The usually stiff Shin did something like
this in front of all those reporters.

373
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,520
If it was in the past, these was unimaginable.

374
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,220
HaeMyung feels this way too?

375
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:03,150
Taking this chance,
let's let them take a step further. How about that?

376
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,960
Mama. Even though the two of them are officially husband and wife but they are still young.

377
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,380
I am still regretting over the fact that
I allowed them to share a room too early.

378
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,350
Hwang-Hu, you are still young but I am old already.

379
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,560
I can't wait to have a great grandchild.

380
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,930
2 years, 3 years, that's too long for me.

381
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,020
Mama, I don't mean it like that.

382
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,680
Do not speak anymore.

383
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,880
Halma Mama, really...

384
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,020
Shin Goon! Shin Goon!

385
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,420
The newspapers and internet are
all splashed with the kissing pictures.

386
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,240
This is so embarrassing.
What to do... Don't care.

387
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,530
The Crown Prince occasionally needs some showmanship.

388
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,270
But this is like too...

389
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,530
For those who notice us...

390
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,360
Shouldn't we show them something they want to see?

391
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,100
For example, something even better than a kissing.

392
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,700
We are no different from professional actors.

393
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:32,300
Using taxes to support the royals.
That is because they need a role model.

394
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,900
We are the idols they learn everything from.
We can use the media to move our fingers.

395
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,360
And we can easily get rid of their unease.

396
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,560
Simple right?

397
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,790
That's what you think.

398
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,880
Don't insult the citizens.

399
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,550
We love the royals from the bottom of our hearts.
We respect the King.

400
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,900
And we have pride in the future king of the country.

401
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,210
Take Yul and get as far away as possible.

402
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,180
Once you leave the palace,
you are never to come back again.

403
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,040
Don't appear in front of me ever again.

404
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,390
How can you be so cruel to me?

405
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,650
You think I don't know your relationship between King Hyo Ryul and King Hyo Tae?

406
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:42,640
Are you imitating the royal family and the country?!!

407
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:54,300
You know the person and
the face but you won't know their hearts.

408
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,930
What a man sows is what he shall reap.

409
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,850
I am conveying a message from His Majesty.

410
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,080
If you were to choose to live outside the palace, the royal family will not provide financial aid.

411
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,930
However if you were to move overseas,
financial aid will be given.

412
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,650
Please make a wise choice.

413
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:40,140
I am merely conveying the message.
I will leave first.

414
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,550
You came?

415
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,800
What are you think about?
You were so deep in thoughts.

416
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,590
Just things about the past.

417
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:20,190
Recently a lot of things happened in the palace and there are a lot of eyes looking at us.

418
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,890
So for this period of time,
it will be better if we meet outside.

419
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,970
Teacher, how is your first love like?

420
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:47,830
Someone said this, a man places his first love in his heart and a woman places her first love in the memories.

421
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,130
But why are you asking this?

422
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,150
There. It hurts very much.

423
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,200
Feels like I am about to die. It hurts.

424
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
I understand how you feel.

425
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,300
I felt like this before.

426
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:21,460
Love made me feel hurt, this world made me feel hurt.
So I wanted to give it all up because I am tired.

427
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,660
But at my age, I realized one thing.
You know what is it?

428
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,590
In life, the thing that is important other than spirit is love.

429
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,400
Even if you are poor, but if there is love you become a millionaire. No matter how rich you are.

430
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:50,600
But if you miss out on love,
you will feel as lonely and as cold as winter.

431
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,560
What do you mean by that?

432
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,510
To protect my love, I paid a heavy price for it.

433
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,230
Then?

434
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,560
I became the owner of love.

435
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,710
Not everyone can take charge and
become the owner of the love.

436
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,540
Isn't it so?

437
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,870
Yul Dae Goon hasn't been paying his respect recently.

438
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,180
I just can't stop worrying about the matter
between him and the Crown Prince.

439
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:30,670
I want to see Yul Dae Goon because of that matter as well. But he hasn't been stepping out of his room.

440
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,400
Don't worry too much.
Boys at this age tend to quarrel often.

441
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,050
Even though they are young, but still they are already starting to have a men's world like thing, right?

442
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:47,750
You can say that but Yul Sung Dae Goon
will be very heartbroken.

443
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:54,700
Halma Mama, why not we take this chance to have a dinner together. How is that?

444
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:05,240
Okay. Hye Jung Jong has returned for so long and we didn't even give her any form of welcome party.

445
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,420
I also thought of having a royal gathering.

446
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,930
It is okay to even have a simple dinner.

447
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:23,460
Good. We can take a picture together.

448
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,120
Picture?

449
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,420
The Crown Prince is married for so long already. And Bingung is not in our family photo.

450
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,770
Our Halma Mama has a lot of senses.

451
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,150
Using modern language, my sense is not bad right?

452
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:11,850
After 14 years, we are together as a royal family again, I shall die without regrets.

453
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,980
Mama. Why are you saying such things?

454
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,850
That's right. Uhma Mama.

455
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,570
You will live a long life.

456
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,620
There are three big lies in this world.

457
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,390
Business man saying that
they are not making any profits, that's number 1.

458
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,230
Pretty girls saying that they are not getting married.
That's number 2.

459
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,150
What is the 3rd one?

460
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:43,020
Elderly saying, "The faster I die, the cleaner it gets". That is number 3

461
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,940
Because of Bingung, I became very humorous lately.

462
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,440
Since when,
the royal family became so not humorous?

463
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,510
Yul Sung Dae Goon Mama has arrived.

464
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,210
Welcome Yul Sung Dae Goon.
We've been waiting for you.

465
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,300
I am sorry I'm late.

466
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,150
It's okay. As long as you came.
Quickly take a seat.

467
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,600
I have something on.
I will be more careful the next time.

468
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:11,010
Regardless, the relationship between the Crown Prince and Crown Princess is very good recently. I am relieved.

469
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,440
It's all because of the blessings of Tae-Hu Mama.

470
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,360
What is that,
it's the result of the kindness of the both of you.

471
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,870
But, our TaeJa is already married. Hwi Sung Dae Goon can also think about getting married. Right?

472
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,340
Mama, let me say something on behalf of Hwi Sung Dae Goon.

473
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,010
Instead of marriage,
he should put more efforts in his studies.

474
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:45,920
What kind of words is that? He is already of age, he should welcome a nice girl.

475
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,550
Yul Sung Dae Goon also wants to get married to a beautiful and kind girl like our Bingung right?

476
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,160
How about that? Tae-Hu Mama is right. Right?

477
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
Yes.

478
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,870
I want to get married quickly as well, but..

479
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,730
I want to get married to someone I like.

480
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,290
You thought about this already,
do you happen to have a girl whom you like?

481
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,860
According to tradition,
his marriage should be arranged by the elders.

482
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,310
There is someone I like.

483
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,650
Is it? Who is it?

484
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,320
You may be curious about who she is exactly, but please do not question further.

485
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,290
I will tell you the next time, when the timing is right.

486
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:46,200
Wah.. Yul has this side of him.
Which girl has stolen the heart of our Prince?

487
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,910
That's right... it's surprising.

488
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:54,340
Even though I don't know who she is,
but I hope your wish can come true.

489
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
It will definitely will.

490
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,580
I bit my tongue!

491
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,540
Blood.. blood...

492
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,300
Are you okay?

493
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
How could you be so careless?

494
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,060
Choi Sang Gong.

495
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Yes Mama.

496
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,080
Please bring some medicine.

497
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,210
Let me go get it.

498
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,220
Bingung Mama, bite on this first.

499
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,080
It's ice. It's good to stop the bleeding.

500
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,610
Okay, Dae Goon Mama.

501
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,750
Are you okay, Bingung?

502
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,190
Yes, Mama.

503
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,150
Is it slightly better?

504
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,410
Yes. Thank...
Thank you very much.

505
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,800
Uhma Mama.

506
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,880
We should have more gatherings in the future.

507
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,450
Good. That's good.

508
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:51,370
The time may be short,
but since I came back from Jejudo...

509
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,290
It's really good for getting into a happy mood.

510
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,500
Halma Mama.

511
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,190
How are you going to spend the rest of your life in the palace when you have such a passionate feelings?

512
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:10,010
If I can get reborn in this world again, I want to get born in a place far away from the palace.

513
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,980
As long as Halma Mama is still alive, there are chances of changes in the Royal family.

514
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,400
What do you mean?

515
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,700
Even the Royal family still exist,
but we can't rule in reality anymore.

516
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,700
Although it's basic spirit of Constitutional Monarchy.

517
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,700
But actually if we see it from another angle.

518
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,000
The royal family just plainly exist however without any reason.

519
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,100
Yul.

520
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,370
Continue.

521
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:46,210
To be honest, the royal family is an expensive toy, existing to ease the boredom of the people.

522
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,360
What do you mean, Dae Goon?

523
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,250
Queen.

524
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:06,010
So to say, I feel that the royal family should not stay this way, enjoying life with the people's taxes.

525
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:15,750
If we want to fight back the power rights of the Royal family that doesn't owe the society anything.

526
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,710
We, the royal family needs
to become stronger and more powerful.

527
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,000
It's a good idea. But isn't it too over the top?

528
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,800
Why do you think that way?

529
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:30,700
Even though there isn't practicality and a limit...
The royal family is respected by all the citizens.

530
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,420
Instead of the importance of the power of the royal family...

531
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,950
We as the protector of the traditions should try to maintain the respects from the people.

532
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,150
Isn't that more important?

533
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,600
Perhaps it's the different perspectives.
Even though the royal family exist...

534
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,160
Comparing a useless royal family, a stronger royal family is better for the future of the people.

535
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,190
Hwi Sung Dae Goon,
has so much thought for the future of the royal family.

536
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,950
But still, protecting and respecting the pre-existing laws..

537
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,740
It is also something we should follow.

538
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,950
There are a lot of royalties in the world.

539
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:14,720
Compared to ruling, they are more concerned about coming united with their citizens as one body.

540
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,030
Since it's the family gathering,
I said some of my perspectives.

541
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,030
I will remember what Pyeha has said.

542
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,030
Yes.

543
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,810
Regardless, you have already thought about this,
it is already a good thing.

544
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,700
Rin, you are not leaving?

545
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,200
I'll give you a ride.

546
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,900
You can go first.

547
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,270
Where did you take this?

548
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,520
It's pretty right? Mama?

549
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Yes. Where did you take this?

550
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,670
It looked like Mama, so I took a picture of it.

551
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,110
This one resemble you, this one is me.

552
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,000
Shall we take a seat?

553
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,190
Finally I can see Yul Goon's face.

554
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,720
Are you sick during this period?

555
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,240
Just thinking about a lot of things.

556
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:57,490
Oh I see.
I thought you fell sick because of what happened that day.

557
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,680
Do I look so weak?

558
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,120
No, just worried..

559
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,860
Were you ever worried about me?

560
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:16,090
Of course, because we are friends, I am Shin Chaegyung who is loyal to her friends.

561
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,190
Friend.

562
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,240
But, is your face alright...

563
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,150
That time...

564
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,900
That incident, let's not mention it again.

565
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,100
I apologize to you first, sorry to cause
a misunderstanding between the both of you.

566
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,080
I was not angry because of you.

567
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,000
That is true, bad mood.
I only went to look for you once.

568
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:58,050
It is really weird. Even though you are not by my side, you are always in my mind.

569
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
What?

570
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:03,860
Many times a day, you are always by my side,
coming into my mind.

571
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,400
So it's okay.

572
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,610
Can I take back my wife?

573
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,710
I told Halma Mama that we can see stars during the day.

574
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,250
She said she wants to see it together with Bingung.

575
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,700
Oh, and also...

576
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,630
That's a very good speech about
the Royal family's reformatory theory.

577
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,740
But in the future, please use something more practical.

578
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,580
Perhaps then I will discuss it with you.

579
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,870
From now onwards...

580
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:18,400
Hwi Sung Dae Goon's thoughts just now,
I got a shock from his perspectives.

581
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Anyway, he was already smart and
sensible since he was young.

582
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,050
All the love in the palace was focused on him alone.

583
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,700
Yes.

584
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,340
My Yul was like that before his life changed totally.

585
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:39,160
I don't mean anything else.

586
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,500
The reason I'm living now is all because of Yul.

587
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,700
He looks more and more like my brother.

588
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,950
I feel proud.

589
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,280
Is that so?

590
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,250
Perhaps it's because he look so alike, I feel insecure.

591
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,090
What's there to feel insecure about?

592
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:10,280
I cannot forget that day, 14 years ago.

593
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:19,800
Just like  Ryul TaeJa,
I feel that one day Yul will leave me.

594
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,280
That's why I am afraid.

595
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,160
I am sorry, Pyeha.
To let you witness such a me.

596
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:44,080
For Tae-Hu Mama and the decreased brother, I'll protect Hwi Sung Dae Goon, don't worry.

597
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:54,540
For myself and my son,
there is only Pyeha we can depend on.

598
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,700
Hwi Sung Goon.

599
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,640
Yes Hwang-Hu Mama.

600
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,800
Let's talk for a while.

601
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,400
Yes.

602
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,390
What is it?

603
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:42,900
Since you entered the palace,
I seem to have neglected you.

604
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,700
It's not like that Mama.

605
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,250
I am after all your aunt.
Treating you harshly, you must have hated me.

606
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,130
And that time, you went out with Bingung...
After thinking it through, I was too harsh on you.

607
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:07,200
It was all my fault, I deserved to get scolded.

608
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:16,840
It is great that you think like that.
But Hwi Sung Dae Goon...

609
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,000
Yes Mama.

610
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:23,250
In this world, there is something that cannot be forced upon. Do you know what that is?

611
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,190
I don't know.

612
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,590
Things like fate, regardless of how hard you tried to grab, you can't seem to grab hold of it.

613
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:44,860
And even if you grab hold of it,
it would not stay in your hands forever.

614
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,800
Eh?

615
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:52,820
If you want a fate that doesn't belong to you, you will get punished. That's the way of life.

616
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:59,890
The relationship between a man and a woman is not something that can be solved by working your brain.

617
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:06,250
To put it in another way.
You will not get what you want even if you are.

618
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,450
The reason that I am telling you this today...

619
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:17,590
It's because I saw something like this a long time ago.

620
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,390
This kind of marriage fate?

621
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,400
A long time ago, there were
mismatched marriages in the palace.

622
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:40,150
If you don't want this mismatched fate to continue, please remember my words.

623
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,350
Okay. Everyone smile.

624
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:56,850
I won't know we will have another gathering
like this to take photos together.

625
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,480
Yes, Uhma Mama.

626
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,220
TaeHwangTae-Hu Mama,
let's use this chance and take more pictures.

627
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,180
Oh. Okay, Bingung.

628
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,310
OK. Everyone's ready?

629
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,730
Yes!

630
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:15,460
Smile more radiantly.
Ready... one, two...

631
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,520
But... Today's family photo is a bit weird.

632
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,000
I didn't take it with mom and dad and Chaejoon, but I am taking it with other people.

633
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And so?

634
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,580
It's like my family changed all of a sudden,
so it is a bit weird.

635
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:04,500
What is so weird about that? After becoming a wife of somebody, isn't this a natural?

636
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,700
I guess I still can't feel it yet.

637
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,350
When are we going to stop being in a same family?

638
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,450
What did you say?

639
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,160
Nothing...

640
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,290
Tomorrow's sun will still rise tomorrow.
I don't want to think about anything today.

641
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,550
Yahhh...You can say such things??

642
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,000
That was a famous line from the movie,
"Gone with the wind"...

643
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,240
With the wind... what is that?

644
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,650
It will be better if I didn't say that.

645
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,450
Do you want to see the sunrise?

646
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,010
I have never seen a sunrise before.

647
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,830
All sunrise are the same.

648
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:57,770
I was actually looking forward to it.

649
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:10,510
Internal officer, don't ask anything, but I'm going to escape for a while with Bingung Mama.

650
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,170
If the elders ask,
just say we have gone with the wind.

651
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,410
Where are we going?

652
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:24,750
To mark the day when your silly brain can actually come out with such a good line...

653
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,700
We're really going to see the real sunrise, why?

654
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:35,760
Really??? Really?? That is so great!
