1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,630
Episode 9

2
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,020
He should have arrived by now.

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,640
I don't know why he suddenly flared up
and went to Thailand alone.

4
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,170
Is it because of Yul?

5
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,330
Was it because I ran to Yul and not to him?

6
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,420
I should have been more considerate.

7
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,190
After all, he is my husband.

8
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,500
Not caring about him and
looking after other people...

9
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,040
If it was me, I would be angry too.

10
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,960
But, so petty.

11
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,180
Yes, BingungMama.

12
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,750
Of course. He arrived safely.

13
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,430
After the welcoming dinner last night,

14
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,350
He had to immediately attend
to some country affairs.

15
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,420
He has been very busy.

16
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,250
Actually I should have contacted
you so you wouldn't worry.

17
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,620
I'm sorry, Mama.

18
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,610
Er, that.

19
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,210
The Prince is attending a
formal function right now.

20
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,140
Once he finishes, I will get him to call you.

21
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,920
Okay, I see.

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
Please let him know.

23
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,880
Hold on, Mister,
please pass on the message.

24
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,600
Yes, thank you!

25
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,310
When you were away,
the Princess called from Seoul.

26
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,740
I told her that once you finished,
you would give her a call.

27
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,280
Do you want to call her now?

28
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,410
Some other time.

29
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,030
Yes, Jeonha.

30
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,450
Would you like some gum?

31
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,100
Thank you!

32
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,620
I heard our country has
a Bottle tree place.

33
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,950
Do you wish to go and see?

34
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,550
Why did you two not go together?

35
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,650
After being married, it's customary for the Royal couple to attend State Functions together.

36
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,750
Was it because the Queen objected?

37
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,450
I heard that from the start,
she has never really liked you.

38
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,950
I am not very sure.

39
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,550
What do I know?

40
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,550
Hwangtaeja-bi Mama.

41
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,750
This was prepared for you.

42
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
You do not need to understand!

43
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,800
Moon Geun Young's style.

44
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,900
You should take care of yourself.

45
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
Jang Dong Gun's style.

46
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,780
Huh? What? Cannot!

47
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,510
Lee Hyori's style.

48
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,820
EXACTLY THE SAME!
EXACTLY THE SAME!

49
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,180
It's the same as Lee Hyori.

50
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,420
Yul, you are no longer the crown Prince.

51
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,590
From now on, you should address
Shin as the Crown Prince.

52
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,370
OK?

53
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,900
Why?
Why should I address Shin like that?

54
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,090
We should go already, let's go.

55
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
No! I want to live here!

56
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,830
We have to go, let's go!

57
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,770
No! I want to live with Shin and
the Great Queen!

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,490
Yul!

59
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,020
No! I don't want to go.

60
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,230
Yul! Yul!

61
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,960
No! No!

62
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,980
Yul! Yul!

63
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,750
You had a nightmare?

64
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,750
When did you come?

65
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,550
Just now.

66
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,550
Are you mad?
What are you talking about?

67
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,580
Yes.

68
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,650
I like Chaegyung.

69
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,700
She is your sister-in-law,
your cousin's wife.

70
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,750
She was betrothed to me at first.

71
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,510
But he snatched her away.

72
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,900
Goodness, what are you talking about?

73
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,650
Do you know what the only thing
I felt thankful for during these times was?

74
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
That when your father
suddenly passed away,

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,870
you wouldn't have to
marry that foolish girl.

76
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,950
But look at what
you're talking about now!

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,390
I like her.

78
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,750
The weird thing is...

79
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,350
hearing that she's
"not beautiful enough"...

80
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,700
and "not suitable to be the Princess"...

81
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,650
The more I hear that...

82
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,650
the more I am attracted to her.

83
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,650
After leaving the Palace at five,
until now...

84
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,550
living my life far away at the border, from the center of the world,

85
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,920
truthfully I didn't hate it.

86
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,600
But..

87
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,030
watching my mother who is having a hard time because she could not forget Palace life,

88
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,750
I'd turn back time to
fulfill my mother's dream.

89
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,040
To fulfill her dream, as her son...

90
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,700
I should also do all I can...

91
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
but I felt a little resentment
hidden away deep inside.

92
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,380
Compared to me...
more than myself,

93
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,540
I am more worried for my mom.

94
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,980
If I could cure the pain you feel inside...

95
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,060
I thought that I wouldn't care
what'll happen to me.

96
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,090
But...

97
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,400
honestly, if I were to say anything now...

98
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm not sure how I feel anymore.

99
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,010
Hello!

100
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,020
Seriously, this is intolerable.

101
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,510
You are not a one or two year old kid.

102
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,980
Yet you are not sensible at all.

103
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,800
So embarrassing.

104
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,540
I know I did wrong.

105
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,600
I thought although the car is very old,

106
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,860
the external design is still new
so I just wanted to touch it.

107
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,320
Then how did you crash the car?

108
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,230
I only slightly...

109
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,870
Regardless of what,
I have to report the matter to the Great Queen.

110
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,610
Let's not talk about this.

111
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,750
During the period which the crown Prince is out of the country,

112
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,860
Prince William from England
will be coming to visit.

113
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,000
During this period of time,
where he should be visiting

114
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,010
and all the official events
will be taken care by you.

115
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,440
What?

116
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,000
Me?

117
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,330
This whole thing is very important.

118
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,540
If anything goes wrong...

119
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,820
I am very afraid that you will
embarrass yourself in front of everyone.

120
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:39,040
Therefore, you must put in your best
in the preparation, understood?

121
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,130
Yes. Mama.

122
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,300
BingungMama,
Great Queen is waiting for you.

123
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,100
Yes?

124
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,000
Great Queen is here?

125
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,700
Where is she?

126
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
I am going crazy soon.

127
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,900
Come on in Princess!

128
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,750
I came into your room
when you are not in.

129
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,060
Please forgive this old lady who always take things into her hand.

130
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,340
What?

131
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:09,800
Looking through your room reminded me of what happened when you first came into the Palace.

132
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,490
Hold on Princess...

133
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,770
how old are you now?

134
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,670
19 years old.

135
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh my! 19 years old?!

136
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,300
There is still such an age in this world.

137
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,780
Mama...

138
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,380
the car that you considered precious...

139
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,050
I accidentally...

140
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,950
Hm?

141
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,100
If it's about the car, do not worry.

142
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:54,350
When I first heard of it,
I was only worried whether you had hurt yourself.

143
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,450
Now that I see that you are fine,
I am so relieved.

144
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,700
Actually the car is quite old.

145
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,490
Because I wanted to maintain appearances, that is why I did not throw the car away.

146
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,050
You helped me clear the trouble,
so I should thank you instead.

147
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,950
So, don't be too upset over this.

148
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,430
I am very sorry.

149
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,600
Thank you, Mama.

150
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,380
You cry over such a small thing...

151
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,900
Now I know what the Crown Prince meant.

152
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,850
Before he left for Thailand...

153
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,200
he came to bid me farewell.

154
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,350
He suddenly said, the representative who is to receive Prince William is you, Princess.

155
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,620
He also told me about your "tears".

156
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,030
Because of him,
you have already cried a few times.

157
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:06,120
Seeing your tears,
he felt something somewhere deep in his heart move.

158
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,730
Your tears are much pure than
the water in the Jade Stream.

159
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,670
Jade Stream?

160
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,600
You have never been there before?

161
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,590
In the backyard of Jang Deuk Palace,

162
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,880
The stream water that flows around
inner side of the Chi Han Pavilion.

163
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,340
The stream water is well-known for
its coolness and purity.

164
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,230
Someday we shall go together.

165
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,270
Yes Mama. Thank you.

166
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,980
I especially made a trip here today to tell you all this.

167
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,590
It would have been better if
these words were told to you face to face.

168
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,290
But, all guys are the same.

169
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,750
What should we women do?

170
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,650
We can only try and understand them.

171
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,380
How about it, Princess?

172
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,130
Yes, Mama.

173
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,530
Thank you.

174
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,510
The scenery here is beautiful!

175
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,540
You see, these pretty ladies' figures
are a kind of art. Isn't it so?

176
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,190
Eyes as big as an Italian woman,
nose as sharp as a Greek girl

177
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,050
legs as slim as a Chinese girl,
teeth as beautiful as an American girl

178
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,350
complexion as good as a British girl and...

179
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,380
Aish there was a lot more...
but for the most beautiful neck

180
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,550
it has to be Thai girls.

181
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,800
If you had that much time,
you should have studied.

182
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,650
Studying and memorizing these things
are two different things.

183
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,850
An Italian girl's eyes, a Greek girl's nose...

184
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,750
neck of a Thai girl?

185
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,330
Then wouldn't the girl look like a freak?

186
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,400
You can find out which hotel it is, right?

187
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,650
What hotel?

188
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,450
The one that Shin is staying at.

189
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,060
Sure.

190
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,080
Can you find out the schedule?

191
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,750
Probably.

192
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,490
Hello?

193
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,130
Yes, it is me. Transfer me to Mr. Choi.

194
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,250
Do you need me to take you home?

195
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,260
No thanks, it is OK.

196
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,220
I shall stay here.

197
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,430
It is the same as the last time at the resort,
I can make my way home myself

198
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,850
Afternoon, you will be watching a traditional Thai musical.

199
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,540
In the evening,
there is a press conference for you to attend.

200
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,050
There will be plenty of time in between,
due to the hectic traffic here.

201
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,040
I have arranged for you to rest at the hotel at the venue of the press conference.

202
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,050
Tomorrow's press conference is very important.

203
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,940
It is the first time you'll be giving a speech overseas.

204
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,710
The script has already been prepared so please go through it and give us further instructions.

205
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,470
And, Jeonha...

206
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,940
Do you want to call the Princess?

207
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,170
She called a few times today.

208
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,510
I am hungry, can I eat a bowl of ramen?

209
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,140
Ramen?

210
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,850
Yes, please add an egg inside too.

211
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,050
He didn't answer?

212
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,000
He hasn't returned your calls?

213
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,600
What is wrong again?

214
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,190
I don't know what he's thinking?

215
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,750
After hearing what the Great Queen said,
it seems to be nothing much.

216
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:24,550
But he can suddenly start yelling
and screaming, making it so hard for me.

217
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,470
The person that you're calling is currently unavailable. Your number will be send to him via SMS.

218
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,340
After the woo tone, charges will resume

219
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,470
He wants to fight with me till the end!

220
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,500
I will keep calling him till the very end!

221
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,750
Shin Chaegyung came to school today.

222
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,850
What is she doing in school on a Sunday?

223
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,750
To show off!

224
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,700
She really can act very well.

225
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,650
Including bodyguards and high class sports car.

226
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,250
She borrowed 50 cents from me last time.

227
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,050
That kind of girl being a Princess is so awful! So annoying!

228
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,310
Thankfully, we are not in her class,
how can people stand her?

229
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:24,820
From what I have noticed,
her classmates do not like her much either.

230
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,470
I heard she is really very irritating.

231
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,340
She does badly in school, such a stupid fool actually seduced the crown Prince.

232
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,350
The thought of the taxes that my father paid being in her hands. The feeling is unbearable.

233
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,900
Let's go.

234
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,550
A classic method to present a hard life -anonymous-

235
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,060
Jeonha, after the performance, I have arranged for you to go for a massage

236
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,410
Thai traditional massage can relieve the tiredness in your body.

237
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,750
I do not like people touching me.

238
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,040
Do you not know that?

239
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,100
I am terribly sorry.

240
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,200
I thought you were feeling tired
because of the hectic schedule

241
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,470
I overlooked your dislike.

242
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm very sorry, Jeonha.

243
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,550
Can I use the cell phone please?

244
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,450
Give it to me.

245
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,400
"How are you going to surprise me like that?"

246
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,400
"Haha... so you were surprised? *^^* "

247
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,750
Yes, Ahjushi.

248
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,310
Yes.

249
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,990
There is no other way.

250
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,030
I know.

251
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,720
It's okay.

252
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,740
Take me there.

253
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,960
The place you mentioned last time.

254
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,630
Anywhere will do.

255
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,980
Other than the Palace, anywhere will do.

256
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,700
Oh, Jeonha...

257
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,500
This Thai-style clock is going to be
the tribute to the Thai museum.

258
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,890
Jeonha. Do you want any cold beverage?

259
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,360
How much time is there before the next stop in the schedule?

260
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,400
There is four hours and twenty seven minutes.

261
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,670
Prepare the spa treatment.

262
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,470
Yes, Jeonha?

263
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,340
Forget about the massage.
I just want a simple aroma therapy.

264
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,010
Yes, Jeonha.
I will prepare according to your preferences.

265
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,790
Excuse me, Sir. This is Spa room.

266
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,530
You take a shower and
then you come out again, okay.

267
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,870
Yes. I'm okay.

268
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,170
Shin.

269
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,930
You can't be here.

270
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,730
I don't like to be kind.

271
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,240
I don't, even if I am here.

272
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,940
Take me there.

273
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,410
Where?

274
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,910
Take me to the airport.

275
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,080
I don't want to stay here anyway.

276
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,560
If you don't take me, I will just stay put.

277
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,760
What are you doing? This isn't like you.

278
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,600
What?

279
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,430
What did you say about being me?

280
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,770
Then what is like me?

281
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,650
You are clear about the circumstances I am in now.

282
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,960
I know.

283
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,270
I know it better than anyone else.

284
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,670
That's why we had been dating secretly for 2 years.

285
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,840
Even if "I love you" had been said
a thousand times in the relationship,

286
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,550
it can just simply end with the word "breakup".
This is love.

287
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,320
Yes.

288
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,320
I am nothing to you now right?

289
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,490
What's exactly is wrong with you?

290
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,620
You don't know?

291
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,960
We are over.

292
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,070
We have nothing to do with each other anymore.

293
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,340
Everywhere you go, there is news of you.

294
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,870
Where did you go, whom did you see,
what did you do, what did you wear,

295
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,380
I am able to hear all these little details.

296
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:49,280
Even when I close my eyes and cover my ears,
I am still able to know your whereabouts.

297
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,160
I see you in the newspapers, on the TV,
and it's driving me crazy.

298
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,090
I am just an outsider,
with only the views of a commoner now.

299
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Can you understand how I feel?

300
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,100
And you say "this isn't me"?

301
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,800
So what should I do to be like me?
How should I be like me.

302
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,720
Let go.

303
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,890
I...

304
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,030
never for once felt like I was your girlfriend.

305
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,470
Hyorin.

306
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Enough.

307
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,940
I am fine.

308
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,550
Leave. I am leaving too.

309
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,700
She is here.

310
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,810
The Prince's massage session was
canceled at that last minute.

311
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,420
Are we meeting someone?

312
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,830
I thought you wanted to go somewhere other than the Palace.

313
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,760
But it doesn't seems like it's here?

314
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,360
Stop over there. I will ask for directions.

315
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,170
It's been awhile since I came out.
This is real comfortable

316
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,380
Thank you.

317
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,380
I don't feel like stopping and continue to drive straight ahead.

318
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,010
Korean? Honeymoon?

319
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,180
Wow, honeymoon in Thailand! Really sweet!

320
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,750
Before airport, go other place?

321
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,260
No thanks. Please go to the airport. Mr. Pilot.

322
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,860
Wow... how you know me?

323
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,400
Wise! I'm a former pilot on the excellent Thailand airforce.

324
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,340
Yes! I like you guys because you know me!

325
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,010
Okay, yes!

326
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,010
I show you real Thailand! Let's go!

327
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,620
We go the Airport! Thailand!
Woo hoo! Here we go!

328
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,990
Do you want to shop at the marketplace before we go?

329
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,130
Really? Is it really okay?

330
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,060
Should be possible. Because it's you.

331
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,110
Who are those people?

332
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,320
What's wrong? Who are those people?

333
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,220
Don't look. It's the paparazzi.

334
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,700
Hey, what are you doing? You enemy!

335
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,240
Ahjushi, hurry! Uh, can you go faster?

336
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,040
Just what I want! Hold tight!

337
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,690
It feels like we are filming some action packed movie,
like 'Ong bak'.

338
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,330
Ong Bak? You've seen the movie Ong Bak?

339
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,300
Yes, of course. Go faster!

340
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,500
Ong Bak, Korea, go!

341
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,860
Nae Gwan Sir.

342
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,070
Upon looking at the directions,
it seems that he is traveling towards the city.

343
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,400
We are still unable to track his exact location.

344
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,110
Check all the routes where they had went through.

345
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,310
Yes.

346
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,380
Do we seek help from the local authorities?

347
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,320
No. We can't do that.

348
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,650
We can't expose the Prince.
We have to settle this by ourselves.

349
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,200
How is the investigation?

350
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,600
She was at the school initially.

351
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,940
After which, her whereabouts is unknown.
We can't confirm it.

352
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,340
Is she trying to imitate those kids on TV?
Where did she go?

353
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,980
Oh yes. Doesn't she have a cell phone?

354
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,600
Sorry to reply, Mama.

355
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,520
We found her cell phone within the vicinity of the school.

356
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,290
Then... is she taken away by some bad people...

357
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,160
We can't confirm that yet but it is still not so bad.

358
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,790
We already contacted
her family at Sam Cheong Dong.

359
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,470
I am sure we will get news of her soon, Mama.

360
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,630
This is really...

361
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,040
Investigate quickly and make sure there isn't any rumors or news spreading around.

362
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,910
Yes, Mama.

363
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,880
Yes, Hee Soong.

364
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,750
When did you leave Chaegyung?

365
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,820
Mom, Dad..
You still can't get in contact with Pig?

366
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,550
Chaegyung.
We contacted her friends but we still can't find her.

367
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,900
We contacted her friends but we still can't find her.

368
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,060
Where are you? We are all very worried.
We contacted her friends but we still can't find her.

369
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:40,960
That's right. We can't find her.

370
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,700
Call us at home, quick.
That's right. We can't find her.

371
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,690
Call me quickly, if there's news.
Call us at home, quick.

372
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,460
Can you call Kang Hyun later?

373
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,500
Who is that?

374
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,580
It's Hee Soong.

375
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,600
The one that looks like this?

376
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,200
You look for Kang Hyun and get her to call me.

377
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,700
Tell her that I'll be waiting.

378
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,870
That's right, thanks.

379
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,340
Still noone pick up the phone.

380
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,600
Chaegyung!

381
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,350
Please call your dad as soon as possible!

382
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,210
Have a nice honeymoon!

383
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,150
Welcome, looking for a cool place to rest?

384
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,180
We have many options for you to choose from.

385
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,620
A single room is 100 baht ($2.54)

386
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,460
A double room is 200 baht ($5.10)

387
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,360
An air-conditioned room is 500 baht ($12.74)

388
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,970
I don't know what you would like, but a single room is 100 baht,

389
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,970
An air-conditioned room is 500 baht ($12.74)

390
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,200
The room has everything, the air is cool...

391
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,200
Shin.

392
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,550
This looks like a broom right?

393
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,780
What is that?

394
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,220
Yah! Go catch it, hurry...

395
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,020
What are you waiting for?

396
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,250
The truth is...
I am also afraid of lizards.

397
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,460
You are really a Prince.

398
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,870
Okay. I will catch it.

399
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,080
Ya! Get out.
Get out, quick.

400
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,820
Get out!

401
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,590
Get out, quick!

402
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,750
Get out. Quick. Go.

403
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,670
Get out. Quick. Get out. Quick!

404
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,370
Well well.

405
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,040
Min Hyorin, success!

406
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,680
Let all the lizards come out now.

407
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,890
There really are vase trees. This is amazing.

408
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,630
It really looks like a vase, right?

409
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,770
The English name for it is Bottle Tree.

410
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,270
Really?

411
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,110
Oh. It's true.

412
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,490
I bought this just now.

413
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,530
I wore a mask and pretended throughout all these time.

414
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,470
You had been taken on for the past 2 years.

415
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,030
What do you mean by that?

416
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,110
It was not because I was pretending, the truth is that you never see through me clearly.

417
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,380
Those days are all fake.

418
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,940
Today, I am the real Min Hyorin.

419
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,320
You saw the traditional Thai dance just now.
Do you know what it means?

420
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,920
La Ma Kya?

421
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,720
Because of the evil Devil King, Prince Rama, the successor of the king, was trapped in a difficult situation.

422
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,730
But at this time, a monkey appeared to save Prince Rama.

423
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,760
This mask represent the Monkey God.

424
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,700
When you have any difficulties,
it will become a Guardian God to protect you.

425
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,540
Ah, this feels nice...

426
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,680
Min Hyorin finally takes off her mask.

427
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:16,330
Hello, we are here at the press conference where the Prince of Korea, Lee Shin, will make a speech...

428
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,750
Nae Gwan Sir.

429
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,860
We managed to know the whereabouts of the Prince.

430
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:46,860
Really?

431
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,770
He is on the way to the airport.

432
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,770
We will continue to follow him.

433
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:56,470
Mr. Kim, everything is ready.
Do you want to double check?

434
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,110
Yes.

435
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,980
This way, please.

436
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,020
Sir, Choi Sang Mama from the Eastern Palace is here.

437
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,460
The dowager and the Queen is very worried.

438
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,500
Please investigate quickly.

439
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,520
With the Crown Princess?

440
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,530
Have you checked their whereabouts?

441
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,370
I will try to get in contact with them.

442
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:24,970
Try to track the signals from their handphones.

443
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,270
Yes.

444
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:48,490
If heaven exist,
have you ever thought what heaven would look like?

445
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:57,130
I think the most important thing in heaven,
should be the trees.

446
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,900
A place surrounded by greenery.

447
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,350
A place filled with love and peace.

448
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,650
I brought a lunch box.

449
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,080
You really made this?

450
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,100
Of course.

451
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,960
It looks delicious. It's so pretty.

452
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,000
You are actually a girl, right?

453
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,390
You are very troubled, right?

454
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:34,200
You didn't come all the way here
to see the bottle trees, right?

455
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,600
Is it because the life in the Palace is boring?

456
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,300
Or is it because of Shin?

457
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,550
That selfish guy.

458
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,100
If it was me...

459
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,650
I wouldn't have left you alone.

460
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,600
You don't have to cry because of this.

461
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,810
Did I catch a flu?

462
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,480
I couldn't have run out of the Palace myself.

463
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,920
Thanks for bringing me here.

464
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,550
Shin.

465
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,070
Let's go.

466
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,250
Right. It's up to here for today.

467
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,690
What you didn't do as a boyfriend in the past, you made up for everything today. It must be tiring for you.

468
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,490
You did very well.

469
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:18,100
I didn't notice before, but I did today,
you are really a Prince.

470
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,570
Really a Prince.

471
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,470
Thank you.

472
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:02,240
The times we had together, I will never forget them.

473
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,620
It's time for me to go back.

474
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,560
Goodbye, Prince.

475
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,600
I...

476
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,920
...like Shin.

477
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,570
I fell for him.

478
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,500
It's as natural as the rising and the setting of the sun, it's not because that it's Shin.

479
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:43,410
Living in an unfamiliar place,
lonely because I am away from my family.

480
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:48,180
And with my character, I fall for people easily.

481
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,890
This maybe funny but, if I were to have met you first, I could have just fallen for you.

482
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:03,700
But, one sided love is so tiring.

483
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,440
I am not liking someone who is far away from me.

484
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:15,610
He is always beside me, we chat face to face.

485
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:20,550
I fell for someone whom I interact with everyday.

486
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,220
Comparing this to a normal relationship,
this is so much more exhausting.

487
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,890
Sorry, do you feel burden by me telling you this?

488
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,900
But...

489
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Are you more relaxed after telling me?

490
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,740
That's why you even tell me such words.

491
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,080
Of course.

492
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,880
You are much more friendly than
Shin and more gentleman.

493
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,350
Thank you.

494
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,650
Have you ever thought about this!

495
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,790
I'm sorry.

496
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,630
Why do you have to make me worry everyday?

497
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,530
-It is me who insisted on this. Hwang-hu Mama.
-Hye Sung Goon.

498
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,900
-Chaegyung.
-Mom...

499
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,400
Mom.

500
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,670
Please make me King.

501
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,410
It's time.

502
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,880
Please return what Crown Prince Hyo Ryul had given you.

503
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,180
Oppa.

504
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,760
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

505
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,590
Just stop right there.

506
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,150
If you make another move, I will hit you till half dead.
