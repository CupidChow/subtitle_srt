1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to turn back time.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have to face the ups and downs.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of it.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if I know that I will return one day,

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will be destined to lose myself.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I will not regret it.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When I see the falling flowers, I will bear with it for a lifetime.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will slowly understand you.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuo

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Zhang Er! Zhang Er!

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Zhang Er! Zhang Er!

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't leave me.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you leave me alone, I would rather die.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I am to be your father, then let Heaven punish me.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Zhang Er!

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Zhang Er!

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Zhang Er!

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I am willing to bear all the punishment for Master Liu.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But Master Liu is too obsessed with it and doesn't want to be seduced.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He has harmed so many people. It is considered a crime.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It is just that if there was no evil spirit to seduce him,

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
then perhaps everything would not have been like this.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The lost clans that were in the spirit of the Flower Deity

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
were inevitably affected by the power of the spirit.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I must find a way to help Master

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
send the spirit power back to the You Realm.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I cannot repay you for helping Meng Zhang.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is the material of my Golden Dragon and Ghost Spirit.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Even if mortals can use it to gain a glimmer of hope,

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
things that have already happened cannot be saved.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But if the future is predictable,

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it can help all of you to avoid disasters and eliminate disasters.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I hope that you all will take care of yourselves.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tianshu.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Tianshu.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tianshu.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tianshu.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Tianshu.

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What did Master see?

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Zhan Ran, you haven't touched it yet, have you?

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No need.

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No matter how Tianshu records it,

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it's his own life.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He will go to China on his own.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I won't look at it anymore.

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This place is already over.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
After you finish your rest, get up and go back to the West Mountain.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, Master.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
After finding the spiritual power,

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Master's condition is a bit strange.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
With Xuan Yiping temporarily sealing the power of the spiritual power,

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Master should be fine for now, right?

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ran Ran.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
My soldiers have almost recovered.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They are about to leave.

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will go now.

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Tianshu.

60
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Tianshu.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tianshu.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tianshu.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My soldiers have almost recovered.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They are about to leave now.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Master Yu, take care.

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Actually, I came to take you with me.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Didn't you want to go to the capital?

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I did want to go to the capital to see it.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But my body and spiritual power are still too weak.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't leave the West Mountain yet.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If your body is weak,

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you will have to go back to the capital with me.

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can find you the best doctor.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can ensure that you will be safe.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't worry, Master Yu.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just have a weak spiritual power.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I will be fine after I get the golden elixir.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A weak spiritual power?

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ran Ran has been with the immortal for 18 years.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is it because of this

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that Su Yishui must take Ran Ran to the West Mountain to practice?

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Su Yishui is not a good person.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ran Ran is not a good person.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Su Yishui said that you will be fine after you get the golden elixir.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
After I practice for a while,

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will be able to stop the attack.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then I will be close to the golden elixir.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How can I let you stay with him for so long?

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ran Ran, do you know that

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the water-water pool trial will be held in 19 years?

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The water-water pool?

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hundreds of years ago,

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the Water-water Pool was discovered in the West Garden.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There is a bowl of spiritual power pool in the Mount Tianmai.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It can be used to change the fetus and increase the spiritual power.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So after he flew, he specially opened this place

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and changed the water-water pool.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He left it as a blessing to the future generations.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But the water-water pool is opened every 19 years.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The disciples of the school can only get the chance to enter the pool

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
if they participate in the trial and win the first prize.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That is to say,

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
as long as I win the water-water pool trial,

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can get the spiritual power to come to life.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then you can get out of the water-water pool.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The spell has been triggered.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Xi'er.

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Xi'er, what's wrong with you?

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Xi'er.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The sky is dark and the wine is strong.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The wine is strong.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The wine is strong.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The Nine-Tonged Ancient Formation

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is no better than the four masters of the school

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
who were together with the nine disciples of the school.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But it's enough to let you die in peace.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Master.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
My body seems to be being sucked dry.

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Master.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Master.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Master.

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Master.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Master.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Black Dragon Jade.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's Su Yu.

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why is Su Yu here?

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The spell hasn't been triggered.

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hurry and stop.

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That won't do.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We agreed that everyone here would die today.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I won't be a mere word.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's really over.

135
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Master.

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Master.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Die.

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Master.

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Master.

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ran Ran.

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Ran Ran.

142
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ran Ran, are you okay?

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Master Zao sent me to the Protecting Armor Pavilion.

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Su Yu Shui, are you crazy?

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The formation has been broken.

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why didn't you stop?

147
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you know that Ran Ran almost died in your hands?

148
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If she had to die,

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I would never let you off.

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Master.

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I just got a little bit of a shock.

152
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Are you okay?

153
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Master.

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Master.

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My spiritual power is greatly damaged.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't use any more of my powers.

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yuan Yongtao is the Master of the Protecting Armor Pavilion.

158
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He gave me the idea.

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't mess around.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Kill him.

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Su Yu Shui, don't be too arrogant.

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Master Yuan, you...

163
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was wrong.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've been controlling your water.

165
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you had been more calm,

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I wouldn't have touched the water.

167
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're the one who's to blame.

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was wrong.

169
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was wrong, Su Yu Shui.

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I won't do this again.

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
For my sister's sake,

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
please forgive me.

173
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Your sister was so loyal to you.

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She took care of you.

175
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But I'm not her.

176
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I won't be soft-hearted.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't kill you,

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but I'll use thousands of ways to make you suffer.

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Su Yu Shui, I know you're the devil.

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
In the last life,

181
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was the one who was to blame for you.

182
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you don't stop,

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll reveal this secret to the world.

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You think I care about what others know?

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're not afraid of these things.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But don't you care about Xue Ran Ran?

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I know it.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Your disciple Xue Ran Ran,

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
she's your sister,

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Mu Qing Ge, right?

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You don't care about the school

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
knowing that you're the devil.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But Xue Ran Ran is different.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She's your disciple now.

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Her spiritual power is low.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She'll be the most important person in the world.

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She'll never stop.

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
She'll never stop.

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you're in trouble,

200
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
can you protect her?

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Su Yu Shui,

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you must stop me.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Or I'll pull out my sword and kill myself.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm connected to my sister.

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll die.

206
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She'll die.

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll be worthy of her.

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You can use the transformation skill once

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to use it again.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But you won't have a chance to survive.

211
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Try it.

212
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Use the transformation skill once?

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You need to use half of the golden elixir.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you have enough golden elixir now?

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm right?

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not easy to get Su Yu Shui back

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if you want to revive my sister.

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can break the grudge.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I want you to establish your soul.

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can't tell anyone about me and Ran Ran.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You need to keep your mother's name.

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you do that,

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the thunder will strike and your spirit will be destroyed.

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You want me to do such a cruel thing?

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Before the water falls,

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you still have a chance to survive.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Or I'll kill you first.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
At worst, I don't want this half of golden elixir.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I swear,

231
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I won't expose your identity

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and the thunder will strike and your spirit will be destroyed.

233
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Su Yu Shui, you're crazy.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Use the water to go to the West Mountain with me.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Your Highness,

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm here to get the medicine.

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're injured too.

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Take care of your wound.

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Your Highness,

240
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm here to get the medicine.

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're injured too.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Take care of your wound.

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Su Yu Shui injured you.

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Now you have no explanation.

245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're so insignificant.

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The way she was just now...

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Forget it.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think you should go with me.

249
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Master must have found something.

250
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So he won't leave us behind.

251
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm here to get the medicine.

252
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Master must have found something.

253
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So he won't leave us behind.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Master Yu.

255
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Your Highness, there's an emergency on the way.

256
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We can't be late.

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Shan Shan,

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
since you don't want to go with me this time,

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I can't force you.

260
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We'll see about that later.

261
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have to go now.

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Take care of yourself.

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Master Yu,

264
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
take care.

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Your Highness,

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you're not going to die.

267
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm leaving.

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Master.

269
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Master.

270
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Master.

271
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Master.

272
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Master.

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Your Highness.

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Your Highness.

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Your Highness.

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Master.

277
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Master.

278
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Zhongwen U chois au directeur d'

279
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
intervention die Hi

280
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,400
We need to Guinea

281
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,960
n hand

282
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,000
That's a microphone

283
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
Give me a temple

284
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,520
earthquakes

285
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,580
Come on

286
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,200
The wind, right

287
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:17,680
The

288
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,560
Master

289
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,160
I happened to pass by this place.

290
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,120
I sensed that Xiao Shui was nearby,

291
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,600
so I came to take a look.

292
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,320
Master left suddenly just now

293
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,400
because he went to look for the Grave Master.

294
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,160
I thought that the blood was still on the primordial spirit,

295
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,880
so I had to take the burden of resting for a few days before I could recover.

296
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,560
Let's go back to the West Mountain first.

297
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Yes, Master.

298
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,480
What about Mr. Mu?

299
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll go with you.

300
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,160
Mr. Yu just left.

301
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,280
Aren't you going to chase after him?

302
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,160
I want to go with Xiao Shui.

303
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,480
Master.

304
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,280
You didn't look too good before,

305
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
but you were affected by the spiritual power.

306
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,960
Master!

307
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,040
This has nothing to do with you.

308
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,320
I can handle it myself.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Don't ask me.

310
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,120
You have my permission.

311
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,320
Master,

312
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,920
can't you fly by yourself?

313
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,600
Yanran,

314
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
I'll take the blood away first.

315
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Be careful.

316
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
Who is going to set up a trap here and kill us?

317
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,760
The Grave Master is good at feng shui.

318
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
Maybe he can help us find out something.

319
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,640
Maybe he can help us find out something.

320
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,560
Master.

321
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,200
Master.

322
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,760
Clean up the house next to me.

323
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,760
Mr. Mu is going to stay in the West Mountain for a few days.

324
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,440
Yes.

325
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,800
Get the soul-transfer pill from the upper level of the elixir room.

326
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,240
Apply it every day for the blood.

327
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes, Master.

328
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,440
Follow me.

329
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,560
You were so anxious to drag me away just now.

330
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,040
Are you worried that I accidentally said something wrong?

331
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,840
Shut your mouth.

332
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,320
I can shut my mouth,

333
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
but can you control your heart?

334
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,440
You're so vigilant.

335
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
What's the use?

336
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
You're so vigilant.

337
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,640
What's the use?

338
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
You're so vigilant.

339
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
What's the use?

340
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
I saw it before.

341
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,760
You were out of control.

342
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,720
You almost killed me.

343
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
You were a demon.

344
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Now you're carrying the spiritual power.

345
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,800
Are you affected by the evil things like the spiritual power?

346
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,280
But it's still a few years before the door of the You Realm is opened.

347
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
As long as you can't let go of the spiritual power,

348
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
it's always on you.

349
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,920
Maybe one day you'll be out of control again

350
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,280
and kill me.

351
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,280
How's Xia?

352
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,040
Go.

353
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,280
I must catch the victim of Se Zhen crying out

354
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,440
bloodshed against me

355
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,760
and vent hired as well.

356
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,780
She doesn't have much hope left

357
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,700
It is better to push them away

358
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,780
I have it

359
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Why can't I?

360
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Why?

361
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,140
Master Yuchen, is Master here?

362
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,500
Master is not here.

363
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,540
Master told me to pack up the elixir room yesterday

364
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,900
and said he would give it to Mu Ren today.

365
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,140
Mu Xing Pavilion is practicing elixir medicine.

366
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,860
Maybe he went to practice elixir room

367
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,940
and got up early in the morning.

368
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,420
Master actually went to get up in person.

369
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,940
Mu Xing Pavilion

370
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,740
He is about to stop.

371
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,980
If he is in the lair,

372
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,580
my power will be sucked away by him again.

373
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,420
I can't let him succeed.

374
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,420
Before he is in the lair,

375
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,740
the qi is unstable.

376
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,900
He is prone to being burned to death.

377
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,100
I can't fight against him.

378
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,620
But if something goes wrong

379
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,100
with his qi,

380
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,780
I can't blame him.

381
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,300
Ren Ren.

382
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,940
Mr. Mu.

383
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,980
Go and bring snacks for Xiaoshui.

384
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,220
No need.

385
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,020
He is thinking about me.

386
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,100
He is practicing elixir for me these days.

387
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,180
He is not concerned about others.

388
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
You came early in the morning

389
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,460
just to tell me this.

390
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,540
All right, I know.

391
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,060
You left in such a hurry.

392
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,100
But I was right

393
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,180
about your little thoughts about people you can't see.

394
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,140
I can remind you

395
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,260
not to forget your identity

396
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,620
and think about those people

397
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,020
you shouldn't think about.

398
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,940
As long as you maintain peace,

399
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,820
I'll always be on your side.

400
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,780
You're always right.

401
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
In his eyes...

402
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,820
You were a slack who came and went

403
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,740
to spend some time.

404
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,940
He loved you and medoed you now.

405
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,520
Then he was refined and 클�هاï.

406
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,620
Don't take yourself too seriously here.

407
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,060
Rahim, tell me this.

408
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
The poetry feathers all say that Mu Qing is Okay ancientApplause.

409
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,860
Don't think I don't know what you want to do.

410
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,620
You can't stop your delusion.

411
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,260
I'll give you a hand.

412
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,460
You saved my life.

413
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,980
Do you want to repeat the same mistake again?

414
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,660
Master.

415
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,340
Why did you not notice

416
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,740
that you were going to sit on the exploit even when you were not careful?

417
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,780
Master, I...

418
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,880
være focus Mental

419
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,820
No sensation.

420
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:49,620
programs

421
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,040
One̶ n̶e ̶a̶d Third̶ m̶r̶e̶n̶t̶s‿

422
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
Looking back at what had happened,

424
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:42,940
Feng Yin had been obsessed with her

425
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,080
while you were periods away.

426
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,520
I found that

427
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,640
I had gone out of control

428
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,060
of the spirit power that Dr. Feng had been有一

429
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,020
That I had Paula

430
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,760
I won't let myself get close to you again.

431
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,800
Rebellious,

432
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm gonna embarass yours.

433
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,120
Wu Jin Ke.

434
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,960
Did you come to oppose me since you were born?

435
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,040
I won't let this happen to you.

436
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,140
What exactly is this power under the ship?

437
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,100
Look only for the man you want to kill.

438
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,220
That's Ling Xiu...

439
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,980
Ling Xiao!

440
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,820
Are you the Demon Son?

441
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,380
You still can't remember?

442
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,780
No.

443
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,820
I need to see who you are.

444
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,660
What is this place?

445
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm from the past.

446
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,940
Ling Xiao.

447
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,340
Ling Xiao.

448
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,940
No.

449
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,780
This is my memory.

450
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,980
Did I get a shock

451
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,020
and get my memory back

452
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,900
after I got my power up?

453
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,820
I've seen my own memory

454
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,660
from Ling Xiao's memory.

455
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,460
I didn't expect

456
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,940
you'd come to the Netherworld.

457
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,460
Ling Xiao.

458
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,420
I've entered the Netherworld too.

459
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,820
Why should I go there?

460
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,900
Is my past life related to Ling Quan?

461
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,060
What's our relationship?

462
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,980
Ling Xiao.

463
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,180
Look at what you can remember.

464
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,580
Why is everything

465
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,380
different from what I thought?

466
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,180
Who am I?

467
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,860
Who are you?

468
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
This time,

469
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,060
I've made some miscalculations.

470
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,580
Although Su Yisui

471
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,820
has found the whereabouts of Ling Quan,

472
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,420
she won't be brought back

473
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,060
by Ling Quan again

474
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,580
as we expected.

475
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,460
But

476
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,060
as long as she still

477
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,940
has that Ling Quan in her heart,

478
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,780
everything will be easy.

479
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,620
But

480
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,940
I have another plan.

481
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
I know

482
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,020
you can't accept it either.

483
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,660
If you're really a demon,

484
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,020
you've got so much to do with my past life

485
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,380
and even separated the divine soul to protect me.

486
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,940
It's indeed a bit complicated.

487
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,180
No wonder Master

488
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
doesn't want to talk about the past life with me.

489
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,060
You said you won't look for the Soul Master

490
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,140
and won't go back.

491
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,580
No way.

492
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,500
Ling Xiao.

493
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,660
I don't care if you're a demon or not.

494
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,860
You're my friend.

495
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,100
You've been protecting me all the way.

496
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,260
I'll send you back.

497
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,860
Besides,

498
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,900
demons are just ordinary people

499
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,620
born at the special time.

500
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,300
I'll tell you the difference between right and wrong.

501
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,300
Besides,

502
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
I want to be born soon.

503
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,100
Then

504
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
I'll know

505
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,820
how I was born

506
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,140
and how I can help Master return to Ling Quan.

507
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
The fastest way to be born.

508
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,980
Every 19 years,

509
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,300
the disciples of the school

510
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
only get the chance to enter the pool

511
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,700
after they have failed the test.

512
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,620
Ran Ran.

513
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,780
Master 14.

514
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,380
Ran Ran.

515
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Congratulations.

516
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,740
You've succeeded in your life.

517
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,260
Master 14, you're drinking so fast.

518
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,660
Since you've succeeded in your life,

519
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,980
you should have a weapon

520
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
to take advantage of.

521
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,380
The sword you defeated

522
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,140
the Demon of Nine-Hands

523
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,700
is a divine weapon.

524
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
That sword is yours.

525
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,660
That's Mu Qingge's Qingming Sword.

526
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,500
I've handed the sword to Master.

527
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,660
He must cherish it.

528
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,660
I don't want it.

529
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:07,900
Fine.

530
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,900
I don't want it.

531
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,540
I'll make you a better sword.

532
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,540
Thank you, Master.

533
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,860
You're so nice to me.

534
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,980
But

535
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,340
I've already had a sword

536
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,780
that belongs to me.

537
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,460
I want to call it a tree.

538
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,820
Someone once told me

539
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,980
that a tree was planted

540
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,220
and a home was built there.

541
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,380
The West Mountain will be your home.

542
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,460
You'll never be homeless again.

543
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,860
The sword and the tree are in the same body.

544
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
You've never been more mature

545
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,820
than it when you trained it to become a soldier.

546
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,980
With your five-factor spiritual root,

547
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,300
it should be able to change it more.

548
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,220
With my spiritual power,

549
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,660
it shouldn't be able to do that.

550
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,660
But

551
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,860
if I fill it with spiritual energy...

552
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,980
That's wonderful.

553
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,420
Maybe different spiritual energy

554
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,020
can make it change.

555
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,820
I'll try it next time.

556
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,460
Su Mutou,

557
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,980
what's wrong with you?

558
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,820
You were so emotional before.

559
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,860
I couldn't stop you.

560
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,220
Why are you so emotional now?

561
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,260
Nothing.

562
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,620
I think you're right.

563
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,980
Don't come over.

564
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm not.

565
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,620
Don't come over and play this trick.

566
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,100
What do you mean

567
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,980
by bringing Mu Ran Wu back?

568
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,700
What will Ran Ran think

569
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
when she's so cold and hot?

570
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,740
You must explain it to me clearly today.

571
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,060
Wait.

572
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,780
What's wrong with you and me?

573
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,220
Okay.

574
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,140
Let me guess.

575
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,700
You must have been saved by those bastards

576
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,260
from the mountain

577
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,660
and couldn't control your strength.

578
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,500
I heard you lost control in Puxin Village.

579
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,620
It's related to this, right?

580
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,540
So spiritual power can still influence you.

581
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,220
When I was young,

582
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,460
my heart was planted with a drop of spiritual power.

583
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,060
It's always there.

584
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,740
It can't be delayed or delayed.

585
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,420
It responds to spiritual power.

586
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,180
It won't take long.

587
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,340
I can't hold it down

588
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,500
and seal this spiritual power.

589
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,140
You mean

590
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,300
you're afraid that the spiritual power will come back on you?

591
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,300
But

592
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,900
it will take three years

593
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,100
for the Soul Land to reopen.

594
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,460
Can you make it?

595
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,060
I don't know.

596
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,580
But I won't let this happen.

597
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,980
I must find other ways

598
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,180
to enter the Soul Land as soon as possible.

599
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,900
Any other ways?

600
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,340
Not yet.

601
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,140
But Qing Ge entered the Soul Land

602
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,660
at the time of the opening of the secret room.

603
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,260
So there must be other ways.

604
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,300
So you're investigating these files here?

605
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,380
You're also pushing Ran Ran away

606
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
because of this?

607
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,500
She can't be dragged into the abyss by me anymore.

608
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,660
I can't keep her by my side anymore.

609
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,260
I can't let her stay in the West Mountain.

610
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,180
I must make her become a golden egg as soon as possible.

611
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,820
So the soul of the dead

612
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,300
won't have too much impact on her.

613
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,740
When she's out of the body,

614
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,260
she'll have the ability to protect herself

615
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,180
and pursue the ability to live as she wants.

616
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,300
It's not something that can be done in a hurry.

617
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,620
And Ran Ran is now

618
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,900
a lot worse than a golden egg.

619
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,820
As long as she can enter the Water Ruin, she can.

620
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,820
There are many elite talents

621
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,940
who attend the Water Ruin Conference.

622
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,900
But there's only one person who can enter the Water Ruin.

623
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,460
There must be a limit to the method.

624
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,860
Even if Ran Ran has this ability,

625
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,220
she might not get it.

626
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,780
What are you thinking about?

627
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,620
I advise you to be more worried.

628
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,300
Too much obsession will only make the mood unstable.

629
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,980
When you break the ice chain,

630
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,420
you'll lose your power to transform.

631
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,380
Even if you find a way to enter the Water Ruin,

632
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,620
you can't seal the spiritual power.

633
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,260
Nothing can change my plan.

634
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,660
Even if I break the ice chain and fall into the Water Ruin,

635
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,460
I can seal the spiritual power

636
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,780
and fight the consequences.

637
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,020
So what you said before was true.

638
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,140
Xie Er, don't keep sleeping.

639
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,140
Don't you like to be lively?

640
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,380
Wake up.

641
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,940
I'll take you to the market

642
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,060
and buy you your favorite food.

643
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,900
Wake up, will you?

644
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,620
Second Brother,

645
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,940
I've opened the door

646
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,660
and made this Gu Yan Elixir.

647
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Give it to Xie Er.

648
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
Okay.

649
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Junior Sister,

650
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,420
you look different after you entered the Water Ruin.

651
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,260
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

652
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,500
Second Brother, are you tired and confused?

653
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,420
Why can't I understand what you're saying?

654
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,500
I just feel like you're like a person now.

655
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,300
But I can't figure out who you're like.

656
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,660
Xie Er.

657
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,660
Xie Er, you're awake.

658
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,500
Here, take it slow.

659
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,460
Xie Er, are you okay?

660
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,140
We're back in the West Mountain.

661
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,780
Drink some water and warm your throat.

662
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,380
Are you feeling unwell?

663
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,820
You want to ask us what's going on, right?

664
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,380
Actually, we don't know.

665
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,980
Master didn't say anything

666
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,460
when we came here.

667
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,740
But we're fine now.

668
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,820
There's another good news.

669
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
Ran Ran succeeded in helping Ji.

670
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,260
That's great.

671
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
We're back in the West Mountain.

672
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,660
It's okay.

673
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Get well soon.

674
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,300
I'll train with you.

675
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,060
Let's fight for her.

676
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,060
Ran Ran.

677
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,540
Ran Ran.

678
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,180
Xie Er, you're awake.

679
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,740
That's great.

680
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,460
This is a letter from the God of Wine.

681
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,620
Here, drink some more.

682
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,700
Ran Ran.

683
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,700
The talisman you sent is the Nine-Tong Ji Ancient Formation.

684
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,140
This is the formation

685
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,780
that killed Mu Yatou in the Xuan Gate.

686
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,900
Who would use this formation to harm you?

687
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,060
The formation is mysterious and complex.

688
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,500
Except for the four masters of the formation,

689
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,620
no one has mastered it.

690
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,140
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,700
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,060
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,460
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,700
I'm sorry.

698
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
I'm sorry.

699
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,940
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,060
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,180
I'm sorry.

702
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm sorry.

703
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,540
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,660
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,140
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,260
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,380
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,740
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,740
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
I'm sorry.

719
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,220
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,340
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,460
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,580
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
I'm sorry.

724
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
I'm sorry.

727
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
I'm sorry.

728
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,780
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,020
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,380
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,500
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,740
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,740
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,860
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,980
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,220
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
