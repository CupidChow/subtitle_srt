00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,160
that the immortals killed the ancient demon god,

the Mortal-Demon Lord,

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,110
but couldn't destroy its spiritual power.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
So they had to seal the Spirit Spring

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,260

with enough power to destroy the universe.

living recklessly.

178
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,100
All of the Heavenly Sects have regarded her as evil.

179
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,820
Somehow,

180
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,540
she got involved with Su Yu.

181
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,760
Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s a trouble.

182
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,670
Go and get punished.

183
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,270
So what?

184
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,780
No one can stop me

185
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,710
from accomplishing a great cause.

[Capital, Prince Zong's residence]

Will Prince Zong's residence

188
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,540
be implicated given what happened today?

189
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,670
His Majesty is wise.

190
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,110
His Majesty won't believe that

191
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,420
those enemies have something to do with my father and me.

192
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,020
By the way,

193
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,590
the people from Marquis Yong'an's residence

194
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
in the military camp just now

195
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,870
have always been dissatisfied with Prince Ping.

196
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,110
They were rude.

197
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,770
Don't take it to heart.

198
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,560
I don't care what your minions do.

199
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,450
I'm still worried about

200

201
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,030

205
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,870
The legitimate son told me as soon as he came back

206
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,020
that you would come today too.

207
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,240
I asked my servants

208
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,200
to prepare many tea snacks for you.

209

During this time,

you've been by Yu's side.

212
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,720
Did you cause him any trouble?

213
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,350
I've always treated Wu as my sister.

214
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,080
How could there be any trouble?

215
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,830

[Capital, Prince Ping's residence]

The Crown Prince has been dead for many years.

His Majesty

219

between me and Prince Zong.

221
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,770
Although what happened today

222
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,160
didn't help him gain power

223
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,850

power in the court

226
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,060
is still formidable.

227
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,230
So,

228
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,060

That can help His Majesty complete his great cause.

235
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,360
So, His Majesty took him back to his mansion.

called Spirit Spring.

As long as you have it,

Unfortunately,

353
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,710
this technique

354
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,070
has been sealed off by the Eternal Sect.

355
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,180
That's no problem.

356

They're just a cultivation sect.

357

I'll send troops to annihilate them.

Father, you can't.

359
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,440
If we rob them,

360
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
we might alert them

361
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,830
and draw Prince Zong's attention.

362
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,560
Why don't you leave this to me?

363

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,080
Especially when it involves the royal power.

367
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,870
I'm going to join the sect as a disciple

368

and take the chance to get the Demon Heart Primordial Absorption Technique.

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,630
I need to hide my real identity.

370
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,500
Why do you have to have to get this Demon Heart

Primordial Absorption Technique yourself?

372

It doesn't matter if I

do it myself.

374

to integrate the Spirit Spring,

380
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,740
I will eventually be swallowed by the Spirit Spring.

381
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,660
If I master

382
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,260
the supreme technique of a Heavenly Sect,

383
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,870

there's room for me to fight.

387

But after becoming an immortal,

Otherwise,

with only one Five Spirit Roots, which is me, in the world,

If it meets the Spirit Spring or the Demon's child,

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,740
it will sense it.

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,350
Iâ€™ve sent people to search everywhere.

523
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,460
But there hasn't been

524
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
any news for days.

525
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,070
I'm worried

526
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,930
for his safety.

527
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,680
You want me to help you?

528
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,650
Qingge.

529
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,250
I know those of the Heavenly Sects

530
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,310
can't interfere with royal affairs.

531
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,260
But...

532
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,620
But I really can't

533
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,100
ignore my brother's life.

534
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,260
You once said you would repay me.

535
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,160
I shouldn't threaten you.

536
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,630
But this time,

537
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,280
can I use this favor

538
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,040
in exchange?

539
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,230
Please save my second brother.

540
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,260
When my sister

541
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,630
and I were escaping from the famine when we were young,

542
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,630
you once helped us by giving us food.

543
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,810
Are you really going to use this favor

544
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,010
to save your brother?

545
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,030
He is my brother.

546
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,260
Nothing is more important

547
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,530
than his safety.

548
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,740
Okay.

549
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,210
I promise you.

550
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,070
I will return your brother

551
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,350
to you safely.

552
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,480
He was kidnapped here.

553
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,120
A hidden talisman?

554
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,550
That's a Eternal Sect technique.

555
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,150
They didnâ€™t kill him on the spot

556
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,150
but abducted him.

557
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,430
That means he should be fine now.

558
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,180
Young Master,

559
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,870
it's fate that

560
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,000
we meet here by fate.

561
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Have a drink on me.

562
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I am Mu Qingge

563
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
from Wester Sect.

564
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,030
Donâ€™t turn me down.

565
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,110
You're pretty handsome.

566
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,200
Quite up my alley.

567
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Would you like to come back to Mount Wester with me?

568
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,660
You have a good foundation.

569
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,700
Unfortunately, you didn't cultivate well

570
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,500
and practiced martial arts

571
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,160
just to rob and kidnap people.

572
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,870
The Second Young Master of the Prince Zong's residence

573
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,930
is with you, right?

574
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,020
Give him to me.

575
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,350
What Second Young Master?

576
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,740
I don't understand what you're talking about.

577
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,550
Su Yishui.

578
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
Although your disguise technique

579
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,790
is done well,

580
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,000
since the last time

581
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,160
I saw you,

582
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,720
I have engraved

583
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,870
your beautiful eyes

584
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,110
deeply on my mind.

585
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,830
You got the wrong person.

586
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,890
My name is Su Cheng.

587
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm not the person youâ€™re looking for.

588
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,980
Su Cheng?

589
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,190
Very well.

590
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,360
Let me

591
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,650
unveil your true face.

592
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,310
You demoness.

593
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,120
Let go of me!

594
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,220
Why panic?

595
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,750
Am I that scary?

596
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,950
If you don't

597
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,420
hand him over today,

598
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,090
you can never escape me.

599
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,550
Impressive.

600
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,800
Even I can't break

601
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,290
your disguise technique.

602
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,830
Demoness...

603
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,700
To escape, he'd rather injure himself.

604
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,590
He was born with the Five Spirit Roots?

605
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,310
Just like me.

606
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,070
What a coincidence.

607
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,090
He learns pretty fast.

608
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,790
You came here yourself.

609
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,070
This is not my fault.

610
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,390
Where is the sedan chair?

611
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,060
Go find it.

612
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,290
What a handsome bride.

613
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,030
You want to run away after getting on the bridal sedan?

614
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,490
Tell me.

615
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,530
Where is he?

616
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,460
Guess.

617
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,440
You still want to make a bet with me?

618
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,100
Over there!

619
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,390
The sedan chair is over there!

620
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,790
Hurry!

621
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,440
That's right.

622
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,070
Let's bet

623
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,470
if you can get this right.

624
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,550
The number of people coming,

625
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,830
is it an odd or even number?

626
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,260
I'll tell you if you're right.

627
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,830
I've never lost a bet.

628
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I'm guessing it's

629
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,150
even.

630
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,659
You lost.

631
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,120
Wrong.

632
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,190
It's a single number.

633
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,030
Run! Run!

634
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,739
Demonic energy?

635
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,090
The Yin Eye Stone is lit.

636
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,179
He's the Demon's child?

637
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,480
[Mount Cuiwei]

638
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,070
Go!

639
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,910
Why did you stop?

640
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
How about

641
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,350
I help you?

642
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,260
Qingge asked us

643
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,700
to check someoneâ€™s information for her.

644
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,260
I quit

645
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,820
this game.

646
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,750
Trying to play dirty again?

647
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,740
Save this game for now.

648
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,670
We'll play again next time.

649
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,660
I finally beat you once.

650
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,860
How could you do this?

651
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,940
Come to think of it,

652
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,030
Su Yishui can be quite hostile

653
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,380
when he does Prince Ping's bidding.

654
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,110
But he's not exactly

655
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,570
an unredeemable villain.

656
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,440
After all, Demon's child

657
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,810
is just a form of nature.

658
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,960
He has yet to bring disaster to the world.

659
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,700
How can I

660
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,590
judge him based on

661
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,390
what could happen in the future?

662
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,940
I have an idea.

663
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,860
If I take him as my disciple

664
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,140
and destroy his Demon's child nature,

665
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,940
there's nothing to worry about.

666
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,630
But if he really

667
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,110
become a demon,

668
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,400
I don't have to show mercy.

669
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,100
I can only kill the demon.

670
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,480
Everything

671
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,060
will be determined by his heart.

672
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,630
You just won't leave me alone.

673
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,150
Kid.

674
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,160
You were so harsh just now.

675
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,220
Looks like Immortal Kaiyuan

676
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,480
didn't teach you well.

677
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
Let me teach you then.

678
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,310
I'm now in the Transcendence Realm.

679
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,650
You have a good foundation,

680
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,310
but you've just reached the Foundation Building.

681
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,310
You can't escape.

682
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,980
I've killed him.

683
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,700
It's useless for you to follow me.

684
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,110
If you really wanted to kill him,

685
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,980
why kidnap him first before killing?

686
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,180
That's unnecessary.

687
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,700
Looks like I was right.

688
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,610
It doesn't matter.

689
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,590
I will find him.

690
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,560
I have a new idea.

691
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,920
I haven't received

692
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,780
a disciple as talented as you are.

693
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,830
Recently,

694
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,520
I've received a few

695
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,920
good martial arts books.

696
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:57,940
I need

697
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,180
a talented disciple to practice together.

698
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,900
I think

699
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
you are suitable.

700
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,150
I don't think so.

701
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,150
We'll know if it's suitable

702
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,310
after we try it.

703
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,690
How about this?

704
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,900
What do you like?

705
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,480
No matter it's gold, silver, jade,

706
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,410
or rare beasts,

707
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,750
I'll get them for you.

708
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,110
From now on, just follow me

709
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,170
and be my disciple.

710
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,590
I like it when you stay away from me.

711
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,440
This is a bit difficult.

712
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,590
I think

713
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,770
you look better

714
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,190
with your original face.

715
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,470
One more bet.

716
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,900
If I can find out

717
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,790
the flaw of your disguise technique,

718
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,700
call me Master.

719
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,310
-In your dreams.
-That's settled then.

720
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,830
Su Cheng!

721
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,420
Su Cheng!

722
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,500
We were just going to the Eternal Sect for a lesson.

723
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,990
But we saw you as we came down the mountain.

[Disciple of Hollow Sect, Wen Hongshan]

725
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,760
Why are you

726
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
near our Hollow Sect?

727
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,250
I've been chased by

728
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,120
a demoness all the way here.

729
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,500
Mu Qingge?

730
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,740
You know me?

731
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,890
You're collecting pretty boys everywhere.

732
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,820
So dissolute.

733
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,390
You're infamous!

734
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,900
Now you're clinging to the powerful

735
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,070
and interfering with the worldly matters,

736
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,990
you're despised by all Heavenly Sects.

737
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,450
You pestering Su Cheng...

738
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,920
Stay away from him!

739
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,700
Since you already said

740
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,110
I like pretty boys,

741
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,470
how could I let go of

742
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,380
one that is as beautiful as he is?

743
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,980
I'll take you as my disciple.

744
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,530
This demoness is trying to bring me to Mount Wester against my will.

745
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,510
I would rather die than obey,

746
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,910
but I can't get rid of her.

747
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,380
Shameless!

748
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,940
Set up the formation!

749
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,440
Calm down.

750
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,860
We are all girls.

751
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,740
It's ugly for us to fight.

752
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,820
Cut the crap.

753

[Eternal Sect]

754
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,920
I finally got rid of that demoness.

755

Su Cheng.

756
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,680
You just got promoted to an internal disciple,

757
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,540
yet you only return after a month.

758
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,550
If you're so relaxed,

759

[Sovereign of Eternal Sect, Yan Liangyu]

760

how can you cultivate?

761
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,220
Senior, you should worry about

762
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,480
your own cultivation.

763
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,880
-Youâ€¦
-Su Cheng!

764
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,630
Why did you leave

765
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,420
without telling me?

766
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,220
That demoness

767
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,590
has been driven away by us.

768
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,190
Thank you.

769
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,030
I owe you a favor.

770
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,920
I'll pay you back another day.

771
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,470
You said that.

772
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,780
Senior,

773
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,640
haven't you been preparing a gift

774
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,600
for Su Cheng for a

775
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,630
long time?

776
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,870
Give it to him.

777
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,150
Su Cheng,

778
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,690
I made this sword tassel myself.

779
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,320
I hope you don't mind it.

784
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,660

785
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,200
Thank you, Wen.

786
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,380
He took it.

787
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,150
He took it.

788
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,660
What's wrong?

789
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,470
That demoness hurt you?

790
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,860
If it's just a small injury,

791
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,260
you're being too delicate.

792
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,460
You're not worthy of being a member of the Heavenly Sects.

793
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
You're right.

794
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,010
But whether I'm

795
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,780
worthy or not

796
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,970
is none of your business.

797
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,430
Even if I'm not a disciple of the Heavenly Sects,

798
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,110
Wen's heart is with me.

799
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,580
Itâ€™s useless for you to even think about it.

800
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,430

Yan Liangyu.

804
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,070
As the direct disciple of the sovereign,

805
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,280
that's all you're capable of?

806
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,680
That can't hurt me at all.

807
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,830
What a loser.

808
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,030
Su Cheng!

809
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,180

Su Cheng.

811
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,570
Yan Liangyu, are you crazy?

812
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,030
Slowly.

813
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,520
Be careful.

814
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,560
He's just stronger than me.

815
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,630
Itâ€™s not his fault.

bone to pick with Su Cheng?

821
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,740
I...

822
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,480
He's shrouded in evil aura.

823
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,590
Wen,

824
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,510
you'd better stay away from him

825
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,110
before he corrects himself.

826
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,520
I know what to do.

827
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,230
It's none of your business.

828
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,740
Senior.

829
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,600
They flirt with each other,

830
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,110
and are basically a couple.

831
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,240
You stand no chance.

832
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,180
That's right.

833
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,070
You two want to get beaten up

834
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,550
too?

835
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,990
I finally forced Yan Liangyu

836
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,120
to use Immortal Kaiyuan's technique.

837
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,510
Now I can extract Immortal Kaiyuan's

838
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,820
direct spiritual power

839
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,950

Prince Zong's second son last time.

844
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,700
I won't give you

845
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,980
another chance.

846
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,660
If you fail this time,

847
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,150

Why are you here?

852
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,780
The Eternal Sect's barrier

853
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,030
is pretty difficult to break.

854
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,360
But it's worth it if I can

855
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,530
take you as my disciple.

856
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,760
I said no way.

857

That's why we're making a bet.

You have a lot of secrets.

859
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,220
You must be afraid of being found out.

860

If you don't agree,

861
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,950
I'll call someone over.

That's right.

865
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,510
I'll start looking for the breakthrough.

866

Nose, chin, and neck.

867
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,110

00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,930
How beautiful.

870
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,260
Are you looking for a weakness

871
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,860
or flirtâ€“

872
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,340
I found it.

873
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,960
How did you find it?

874
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,090
You're determined.

875
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,590
So you can breathe slowly

876
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,660
and your heartbeat is stable.

877
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,330
But this is where the weakness is at.

878
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,210
No one with

879
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,300
earlobes closer to each other

880
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,150
can have more stable

881
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,410
breath and heartbeat.

882
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,620
It's obvious you're suppressing it.

883
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,350
Naturally, it's the weakness.

884
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,990
You have such a good face,

885
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,150
why hide it?

886
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,270
Let's go.

887
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,160
Go to Mount Wester with me.

888
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,740
Trying to cheat?

889
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,220
I'll have to knock you out

890
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
and drag you back.

891
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,240
Do you still want to find

892
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,530
Prince Zong's son?

893
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,590
This is where he is.

894
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,990
If you're late, he will be dead.

895
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,430
At such a young age,

896
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,660
you're pretty good at

897
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,590
having people under your control.

898
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,030
But after I save him,

899
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,820
I will still come back to you.

900
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,950
You can't escape.

901
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,110
Where did you learn that?

902
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,180
You're so cruel,

903
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,020
wanting to kill so easily.

904
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,590
You ruined my plan.

905
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,630
A tree can't become a material if not trimmed.

906
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,230
If I don't teach you a lesson,

907
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,990
you'll only become worse.

908
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,630
Hey!

909
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,750
Oh no.

910
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,840
Something's going on in the library!

911
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,950
Take him down!
