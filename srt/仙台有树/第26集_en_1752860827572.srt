1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,960
The Love by Hypnotic

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times in the mortal world.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To travel to the north and the west.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of it.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am destined to be the one to return the favor of the world.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I still have no fear or regret.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love and hate of the world.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 21

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will not push you to Su Yishui.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But in the end,

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will not be able to see you.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will not be able to see you.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I will not be able to see you.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But in the end,

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what did I get?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I got the poison that my second brother secretly sent me.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I got the poison that he gave me

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
to poison the position of the Crown Prince.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will not be able to see you.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The poison you got was sent by your brother?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was too stupid to get it.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It turns out that it is not important to be born in the royal family.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It is a pity that I understood it too late.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I killed that ungrateful thing.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I also could not get back the fact that I had been poisoned into the grave.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So now,

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have to use this method to change my body.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am also a despicable and helpless person.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I really regret my choice.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But now that I have the chance to survive,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I will of course not accept this situation.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No matter what price I pay,

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have to change everything.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let us think of another way together, okay?

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have learned a lot from my own experience.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And there are many capable knights in this world.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ran Ran,

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
what I want

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is never any medicine.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It is not the years of living in the abyss.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What I want is the whole world!

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I will definitely stop you.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why?

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You said that the Xuan Men Sect was not a good place to be,

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but you let go of all of this to help me.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But this time,

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
why can't I?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I do not need you to interfere in anything.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I only want you to stand by my side.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That is enough.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dad.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why did you bring me here?

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have already set up a formation in the Eastern Palace.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Especially in this question,

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
no matter if you are willing to help me,

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
what I want to do,

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
no one can stop me.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Even Su Yi Shui who has a strong power in the self-defense,

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
he cannot do it.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I will definitely help you.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will definitely help you.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I will definitely help you.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I will definitely help you.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will definitely help you.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He cannot do it either.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So you sealed the question.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Su Yi Shui will come to the door.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I am really happy.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The way Lao Feng gave me life

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
was to borrow the water path of the four directions

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to gather the spiritual energy of the world to practice the flower and the dragon.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The earthquake made the water path collapse.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is how I knew that the water path was full of resentment.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It is a coincidence that the spiritual energy can be practiced faster than the flower and the dragon.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I met you in Puxin Village.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I knew that the resentment in the water path

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
came from the spiritual power.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Spiritual power?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Spiritual power?

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Just let him try to confuse us.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In the next few moments,

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the spiritual power cannot be known to more people.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So you were pretending.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I underestimated you.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If not,

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
how could I have heard your conversation with Meng Zhang?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It made me more sure that the Seven Evil Formation was effective.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Besides being able to make the body and the two of them an accident,

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
it can also attract soul energy

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and be forever concentrated in someone else's body.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So from that moment on,

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
you were sure that you would change your body plan.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I didn't expect that the resentment would increase.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,700
It was the dragon's

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,000
I didn't want to hurt the people in the city because of this.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's why I used a lot of cultivation elixirs to suppress it.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It was also because of this

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that I was hesitant about how to use the body plan.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
After all, the dragon's nature is hard to train.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If I can't defeat the dragon's spirit

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and get suppressed by the dragon's nature, it will be troublesome.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But at this moment,

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I found out that Su Yi Shui was eating at the water path.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He could use the Soul Tree to hurt the White Tiger.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You!

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I also happen to know that he once sent a soul message

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to help Meng Zhang find the lost dragon's egg

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and send it back to the dragon's island.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I knew that Su Yi Shui would definitely come to save the dragon.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He would use his Soul Tree to clean the dragon's body.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This way, he would give up his body

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and his body.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
His power is so powerful that he can bear to take the snake.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you think this is a good plan?

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
After all, in this world,

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
no one is more suitable than Su Yi Shui

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to let me take the snake.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
After all, he is my cousin.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We look alike since we were young.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If I switch bodies with him,

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can solve the problem of the appearance and the transformation better.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, I can also have a spiritual power.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Despicable!

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everything is under my control now.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I want what I want.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ran Ran,

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
now is the right time.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
After I take Su Yi Shui's body,

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I will come to marry you.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is that okay?

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
At that time,

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you can take the right to two people to accompany me.

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Su Yi, are you crazy?

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I will never marry you.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When you become my Crown Princess,

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I will do anything for you.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But now,

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't let you.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Guards!

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes!

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes!

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let Ran Ran

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
enter Qingliang Hall

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
until she agrees to marry me.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes!

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Master wants to suppress Qinglong's power.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Only when we return to Chongyang,

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
can we take her out of Wen Tan.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This way, we won't be in danger of the whole capital.

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But Su Yu will be captured before that.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She has already died today.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Master doesn't know that Su Yu is going to be captured.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I must find a way to get out of here

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and stop this.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you want to go out for a walk,

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
send someone to tell me.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will accompany you no matter how busy I am.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ran Ran, look.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is the wedding dress I prepared for you.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Also,

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
do you still remember this pearl?

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was in danger because of the court people.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was in a lot of trouble.

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In order to be with me,

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you took me to the beach to eat the pearl.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You ate it at this moment.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
At that time, you were joking with me.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is the pearl I personally found.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It is the only one in the world.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can give it to your bride in the future.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I always remember this sentence.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's just that you don't know

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
that from the very beginning,

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the person I wanted to give this pearl to

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
was only you.

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't remember what you said.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This pearl is not suitable for me.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's okay.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In the past,

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
when we got married,

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I had a lot of time

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to tell you.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Su Yu,

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
did you hear what I said clearly?

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let me go.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't hurt my master.

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't hurt those innocent people.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Maybe we can still be friends in the future.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will definitely think of a way.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You should know that I never

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
want to be friends.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't talk about the rest.

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
From last night until today,

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you haven't eaten yet, right?

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sit down.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Eat with me.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Only when you are full and satisfied,

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
can you have the strength to escape.

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay.

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Since you lost yourself for more than ten years,

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
no one has eaten with me like this anymore.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This stewed lamb

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and this grilled pork ribs,

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I made them myself this morning.

208
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
These are all your favorite dishes.

209
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You taught me how to make them.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
These days, every time I feel lonely,

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I feel like I miss you,

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will make these dishes.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Eat quickly.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Come.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Try this grilled pork ribs.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Does it taste like the taste you made back then?

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't like these dishes anymore.

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I will bring the cook of today's dinner.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Greetings, Crown Prince.

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The dishes you made,

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Crown Princess likes them very much.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you for your appreciation.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The dishes I made

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
can be liked by Crown Princess.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's my blessing.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The dishes Crown Princess likes

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
are even better than the ones I made.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How do you think I should reward you?

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I dare not.

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Come.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Take it off.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Close the door.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Your Highness, are you crazy?

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
From now on, you can only like the dishes I made for you.

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can only like the things I gave you.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You can only like me.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you still care about something else,

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
then I will make them disappear.

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Take them away.

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will eat them now.

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let them go.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's right.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

249
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Leave.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Sit.

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Sit.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Whatever you like,

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
tell me.

255
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I will do it for you.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
By the way,

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I told you about the red leaves I took you to see.

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And the best duck in the capital.

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I remember all of them.

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I will accompany you

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to make up for the past ten years.

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I will make up for the past ten years.

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Do you have medicine?

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You still care about me.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You care about me.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Right?

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I care about you

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
because I still remember

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the young master Yu who helped me

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to get out of the mountain.

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I know you are not like that.

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Be yourself.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was like this

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
before.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If I turn back now,

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I will die.

277
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So I can only

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
walk to the end

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
until I reach the highest position.

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The palace is heavily guarded.

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The barrier around us can't be broken.

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We can't even wear clothes.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
how are Ran Ran and master.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
These things are on sale again.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Gold, wood, water, fire, soil.

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I got it.

288
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Five elements.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It can help me

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to strengthen my power on the charm.

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I can still remember

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the spell of the soul-saving spell

293
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that master used.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If I can use the puppet

295
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to change the spell of the soul-saving spell,

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can make it.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I made it.

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm hungry.

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm starving.

300
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Bring me some food.

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Miss, the food is here.

302
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm hungry.

303
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's been a long time.

304
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
I should have made the

305
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,000
legs of the wooden man longer.

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Xu Ran Ran.

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Master.

308
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You know

309
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that I'm the wooden man so soon.

310
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Who taught you the spell of the soul-saving spell?

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The soul is separated and consumed heavily.

312
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you're not careful, you'll be counteracted

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and hurt yourself.

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're really ridiculous.

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Since you hurt yourself so much,

316
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
what about you?

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You were injured last time

318
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but you haven't recovered.

319
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This time, you used the spell of the soul-saving spell

320
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
to be in the dragon's body.

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Isn't your safety important?

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm me.

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm your master.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're not allowed to do

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
such dangerous things again.

326
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you remember?

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Who is who?

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's not clear who is who.

329
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Xiao Shui, you have to promise me

330
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that you won't take the risk alone again

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and use this dangerous spell.

332
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you understand?

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Alright.

334
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I have something important to tell you.

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's all my fault

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that Su Yu took your body away.

337
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What he wants now

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
is not the Dragon God

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but your body.

340
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I know that Su Yu must have his own plans

341
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to bring me to the capital.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But I didn't expect

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
that he would be here.

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The plan is quite good.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you have any way

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
to get out

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and return to your body?

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Su Yu and the dragon

349
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
can't enter the pool.

350
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Su Yu used a strong spell

351
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
on the Dragon God and the Dragon God.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
My spiritual power

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
is greatly affected.

354
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Unless the dragon rushes out of the pool,

355
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the primordial spirit

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
can only be trapped

357
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
by the Dragon God.

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It can't get out.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What should we do?

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Su Yu will be defeated in the seventh day.

361
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We can't wait until the ninth day.

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If so,

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll go to the pool

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and force the dragon to

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
get out of the pool.

366
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No.

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If we don't have enough

368
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
spiritual power,

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the primordial spirit

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
will be reflected

371
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in the dragon's body

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and will be counteracted.

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're still injured.

374
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You can't take the risk.

375
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll try to

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
delay it for a few more days.

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What's your idea?

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He has a great excuse.

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Since Su Yu wants me to marry him,

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll agree to it.

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But the wedding day

382
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is up to me.

383
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What?

384
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It can not only delay time

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
but also relax the guards.

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can find a chance

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
to investigate the

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
power of the Eastern Palace.

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Otherwise,

390
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
even if my master

391
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
rushes out of the pool,

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the barrier of the Eastern Palace

393
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
will be a trouble.

394
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Su Yu has taken the opportunity

395
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to force you to marry him.

396
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You even agreed to it.

397
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's just a plan.

398
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You stay with me.

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll figure out

401
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
how to get back

402
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
my body and my weakness.

403
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can't marry Su Yu.

404
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You can't marry Su Yu.

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I repeat.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can't marry Su Yu.

407
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But my master is trapped here.

408
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
How can I break the barrier?

409
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Master.

410
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You look so angry.

411
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Are you jealous?

412
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Xue Ran Ran.

413
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do you want to

414
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
go to Xiefeng Valley to be punished?

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This is an order.

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If you dare to...

417
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems that I'm right.

418
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Xiao Shui.

419
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You are so bold.

420
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You dare not be your master

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
but your master.

422
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You still care about your master.

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You are really a traitor.

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Xue Ran Ran.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't worry.

426
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I won't marry Su Yu.

427
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But since you've already

428
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
been a traitor,

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
why don't you marry me?

430
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You are making a fool of yourself.

431
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's talk about this later.

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's get back to business.

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I saw that the energy of the dragon

435
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
has been purified a lot.

436
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What about the Xuan Tian Cult?

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is the Xuan Tian Cult?

438
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've seen it.

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Except for the seven sects

440
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
of the Xuan Tian Sect,

441
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
there are only the seven evil forms

442
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and the magic of the mortal world.

443
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
There is no information about the evil world.

444
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It has nothing to do with

445
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the return of the soul.

446
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But since this thing

447
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
can suppress the dragon,

448
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
it means that it's not fake.

449
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Is there any chance

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
to open it?

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I've tried all kinds of spells.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
There is no change.

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Unless there is another possibility,

454
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
there is another half

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
of the Xuan Tian Cult.

456
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In this way,

457
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
the empty box I found

458
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is really like

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
a small box that can hold

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
two books.

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What you mean is

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that these two halves

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
are one and the same,

464
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
so that the real Xuan Tian Cult

465
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
will be presented.

466
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's right.

467
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Since no one has ever said

468
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
that the Xuan Tian Cult

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
has two books,

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
then there must be some

471
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
hidden fakes

472
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
on the other half.

473
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Su Yu probably didn't find it either.

474
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So he mixed up

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the old books

476
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
of your previous life

477
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and put them in the study.

478
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But since there are two books,

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
there must be something in common.

480
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Master, think about it.

481
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
When you found that empty box,

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
was there anything special

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
next to it?

484
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Book material.

485
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
When I found

486
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
a big map,

487
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
its material

488
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
was the same

489
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
as the Xuan Tian Cult.

490
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This material

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
seems to be a common one.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But in fact,

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
it used a rare

494
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
red and white fire-blossom tree.

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's not afraid of fire.

496
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Red and white fire-blossom tree

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
is not a common thing.

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's not likely to be a coincidence.

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll go find that book now.

500
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Don't be stubborn

501
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
when you are being too strong.

502
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Especially don't be afraid of yourself.

503
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Promise to marry me.

504
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Master, what are you talking about?

505
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm not stable.

506
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Can you hear me?

507
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Xue Ran Ran.

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Master,

509
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I really can't hold it anymore.

510
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay.

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You can communicate with the book

512
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and protect it.

513
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Wait for my good news.

514
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Be careful.

515
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This is the empty box

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
that Master found

517
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
before he left the Xuan Tian Cult.

518
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll go find it.

519
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Here.

520
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I really can't see anything.

521
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's all the same

522
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
the selection of the right way

523
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
to cultivate the mind.

524
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There must be a key

525
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
that can make these two books

526
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
show the real content.

527
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll go find it.

528
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's really like this.

529
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh no.

530
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm not strong enough.

531
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I can't do it.

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The way of the spirit of the spirit.

533
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think I heard something

534
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
fall down.

535
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Master.

536
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Can you hear me?

537
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
This method is really useful.

538
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Master,

539
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
my spirit has returned to its body.

540
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't worry.

541
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That's good.

542
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I found another half of the Xuan Tian Cult.

543
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'll go find it.

544
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay.

545
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll go find it.

546
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

547
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll go find it.

548
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll go find it.

549
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll go find it.

550
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I've already taught Xuan Tian the other half of the Xuan Tian Cult.

551
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's really the same as we thought.

552
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But

553
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
if Xiao Mu Ren can't get it back,

554
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'll find another way.

555
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And

556
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
forget it.

557
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'd better not tell master

558
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
that I've found the method of the spirit of the spirit.

559
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Otherwise, he won't agree.

560
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Master,

561
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll definitely save you.

562
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No matter what,

563
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
don't come here.

564
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I know.

565
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I know.

566
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
How can I change my mind

567
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and agree to marry Su Yu?

568
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's natural.

569
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What?

570
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You don't like

571
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the things I sent you yesterday?

572
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
If you don't behave yourself,

573
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
just say you like some of them.

574
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No.

575
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's too hard.

576
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I think this hairpin

577
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
suits you.

578
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
By the way,

579
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I sent someone to Xu's Village

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
after the morning court today.

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You said

582
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
people in Xu's Village

583
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
have been kind to you.

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Then we can't miss

585
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
such a big thing.

586
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What are you going to do to them?

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't worry.

588
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
As long as you agree to marry me,

589
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
they're the guests of the Crown Princess.

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No one dares to do anything to them.

591
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You use them to threaten me?

592
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Ran Ran,

593
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I want you to understand

594
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
my feelings for you.

595
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'll ask them

596
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
to come here

597
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and ask you for me

598
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
every day.

599
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then you can wear

600
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the wedding dress I prepared for you.

601
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Then you can ask me

602
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
how many people are left

603
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
to give you the answer I want.

604
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't hurt them.

605
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay.

606
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I agree.

607
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I agree to marry you.

608
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You let them go.

609
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You... you finally agree.

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You finally agree to marry me.

611
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Can I have any other choice?

612
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But if you really marry me,

613
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
then four days later.

614
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Four days later?

615
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Chongyang?

616
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I've been dreaming

617
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that on the day of Chongyang,

618
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll wear the wedding dress.

619
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll walk with my husband

620
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in the sky.

621
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I've been thinking

622
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
that maybe this is

623
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the God's arrangement for me.

624
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So,

625
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I've always wanted

626
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to marry you on the day of Chongyang.

627
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
As long as you like it,

628
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll marry you any day.

629
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And,

630
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
if you're really sincere,

631
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
then marry me

632
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
with the real face of

633
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the Crown Prince of Su Yu.

634
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I want to see you as my groom.

635
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay.

636
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll do whatever you want.

637
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Really?

638
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then I have another thing to tell you.

639
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Before the bride gets married,

640
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
there are family members accompanying her.

641
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I want the senior and senior sisters

642
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
of Xishan

643
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
to come to the palace to accompany you.

644
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Isn't it not good to be a nun?

645
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Your senior and senior sisters

646
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
are not suitable to enter the palace.

647
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
How about this?

648
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You used to be

649
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
close to Feihua.

650
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll ask her to accompany you.

651
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay.

652
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll order someone

653
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to bring her here.

654
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Your Highness,

655
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
are you really going to

656
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
send the beautiful lady here?

657
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's okay.

658
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Anyway, with Feihua's ability,

659
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
she can't do anything.

660
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Go.

661
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Qingge.

663
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Feihua.

664
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're the real Qingge.

665
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But,

666
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm afraid

667
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you can't be the real Qingge.

668
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm afraid

669
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you can't be the real Qingge.

670
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But,

671
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I don't remember

672
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
so many things in the past.

673
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
These days,

674
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Su Yu didn't do anything to you, right?

675
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's just that she's not like me.

676
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But I never thought

677
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
she would become

678
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
what she is now.

679
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
These years,

680
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
she has been waiting for you

681
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
until she was in a bad state.

682
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But everything has changed

683
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
since she saw you.

684
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We can't let her

685
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
make the same mistake again.

686
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Feihua, actually, I...

687
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I have a favor to ask you.

688
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What are you waiting for?

689
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Be careful.

690
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm used to it.

691
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Okay, I'll try.

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Don't worry.

693
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No one will hear us

694
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
talking here.

695
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's probably like this.

696
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The bell is bellied.

697
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The bell is bellied.

698
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The root of the sky is the flower.

699
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The weakest point of the formation

700
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
should be around here.

701
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Is there a way

702
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
to break the formation

703
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
of the Eastern Palace?

704
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There's still a little bit to go.

705
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We have to find the right formation

706
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to break the formation.

707
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I also need some help.

708
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But I still have

709
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
no idea.

710
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Mu Ranwu.

711
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe he can help me.

712
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If I count it,

713
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
the golden bell I gave him

714
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
is about to be broken.

715
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I understand.

716
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But

717
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
what will happen to

718
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
His Highness

719
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
in the future?

720
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't know.

721
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't know.

722
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't know.

723
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But his body

724
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
is indeed in the golden bell.

725
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm afraid it won't last long.

726
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Anyway,

727
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't let him

728
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
keep doing it

729
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and continue to harm others.

730
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'll go first.

731
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sister Feihua.

732
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You have to be careful, too.

733
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Your Highness.

734
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

735
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Who's doing the wedding in the palace?

736
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's the Crown Prince

737
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
who married the Crown Princess.

738
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Crown Princess?

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't talk nonsense.

740
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Leave now.

741
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yes.

742
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The Crown Prince married the Crown Princess.

743
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Why don't I know?

744
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Qingge.

745
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't listen to them.

746
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The Crown Prince must have been

747
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
entangled by some magic spell.

748
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Otherwise,

749
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
he would have married

750
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
a little girl

751
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
who broke into the palace.

752
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You mean Xue Ranran?

753
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yes.

754
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm afraid she's not a good person.

755
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'll go to the palace.

756
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yes.

757
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Your Highness.

758
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Please forgive me.

759
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm afraid the Crown Prince

760
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
will make a mistake.

761
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Let him in.

762
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I want to see him.

763
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Open the door.

764
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes.

765
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
How dare you

766
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
come to the palace as my identity?

767
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You...

768
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Isn't your identity

769
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
my identity?

770
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You already know

771
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
who you are.

772
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're scared?

773
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
How could you

774
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
take advantage of my identity?

775
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I can't remember it clearly.

776
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I want to hear you tell me

777
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
how I owe you

778
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
for being my sister

779
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and you killed me

780
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
once.

781
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll do it again.

782
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You took my spirit root

783
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and used my identity

784
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
to deceive and harm people.

785
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You even tried to kill me.

786
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Why?

787
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Why do you ask me?

788
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Whether it's in the past

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
or now,

790
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
everyone around me

791
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
is like a

792
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
long and short

793
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
mother and daughter.

794
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You're so unruly

795
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
to your disciple

796
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and friends.

797
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But how did you

798
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
treat me?

799
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Tell me.

800
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You know I'm not

801
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
a good person

802
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and I'm so useless

803
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that I can't stand people.

804
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But you still

805
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
force me

806
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to enter the school of cultivation.

807
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Since then,

808
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I've been compared,

809
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
mocked

810
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and humiliated.

811
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Do you know

812
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
how inferior I am?

813
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm so inferior to death.

814
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But why

815
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
am I so mediocre?

816
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's all because of you.

817
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
My good sister

818
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and I

819
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
were expelled from our family

820
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and were abandoned in the mountains.

821
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
My father died because of protecting you.

822
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you didn't kill my father,

823
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
if you didn't

824
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
care about others,

825
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and didn't care about

826
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
your sister who died

827
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
of hunger and thirst,

828
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I wouldn't have

829
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
entered the school of cultivation

830
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and had nothing to do with it.

831
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Where are you going?

832
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No one is my company.

833
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Uncle Yan De imitated you.

834
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
He said you were generous

835
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but he nighttime got angry

836
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because you weren't good enough.

837
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,040
If your actions

838
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,600
I hate you so much.

839
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,400
Why can't I be you?

840
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,000
But I died because of you once.

841
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,200
I thought that you had a spiritual root and a talent.

842
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
Isn't that enough?

843
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,200
You said that you hated me.

844
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,600
I have nothing to say.

845
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
But in order to make yourself better,

846
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,200
you climbed up with the body of others.

847
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,000
What is this logic of dying in the cold?

848
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Stop telling me this logic.

849
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
Right.

850
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,400
What logic do I have with such a logical person?

851
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,000
I am here to cause trouble.

852
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I think you are really pitiful and funny.

853
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,800
You are trying so hard to pretend to be me.

854
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
But you are just a dog that can't be a tiger.

855
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,400
You are just a laughing stock.

856
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,000
You...

857
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,800
What?

858
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Do you think I will be like last life?

859
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,000
I will let you live?

860
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,400
Do you still expect me to care about the family that you killed?

861
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,800
Mu Ranwu, you are so funny.

862
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,000
You said that you hope that I will not exist.

863
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,600
But you also live on my name.

864
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Can't you live on your own?

865
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,400
It's a pity that the fake is always the fake.

866
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,800
In the past, I was the only one that Su Yu wanted to marry.

867
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Now that I am back, you are not lucky.

868
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,200
You are crazy!

869
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,800
Su Yu will not let you off when he is back!

870
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
I will kill you first!

871
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,600
Madam Zhan, this is the crown prince's guest.

872
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
You can't hurt him.

873
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,400
You want to stop me?

874
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,800
Any formation has its weak points.

875
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,600
This place can use its weak power.

876
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,400
It must be the weakest point in the defense formation.

877
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,400
Ran Ran.

878
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,600
Where the defense formation is weak,

879
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
the weak point that I can use my power to fight,

880
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
is the breakthrough point.

881
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,000
You think you can escape?

882
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Xiao Bai, it's up to you.

883
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,400
Master.

884
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,000
I surely will drive away the evil from him.

885
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,200
I want you to pass the test.

886
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
It's not easy.

887
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,000
Then you try to save lives,

888
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,800
at the interest of this world.

889
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,600
Stop.

890
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,700
I will be at your control.

891
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,540
I'm sorry.

892
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,140
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,940
I'm sorry.

895
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,700
I'm sorry.

896
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm sorry.

897
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,540
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,540
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,540
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,540
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,540
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,540
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,540
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,540
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,540
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,540
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,540
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,540
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,540
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
