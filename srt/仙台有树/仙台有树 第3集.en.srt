00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Is this what you meant by "alright"?

4
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,020
Just a bit of cold poison left.

5
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,220
No worries.

6
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,700
I'll be fine by tomorrow.

7
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,760
You've fully recovered?

8
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm fine now.

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Did you

10
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,140
guard me all night?

11
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,850
You got hurt because of me.

12
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,500
If I left,

13
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,710
and you got chronically ill,

14
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,370
I'd be the one to blame, right?

15
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,829
Shui, you're indeed

16
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,630
a nice person with a conscience.

17
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,730
Since everything is done,

18
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,950
let's hurry back now.

19
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,540
No rush.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Today is kind of special.

21
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,360
What?

22
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,520
Don't you remember what day it is?

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,650
It's your birthday!

24
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,850
I should celebrate it for you.

25
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,110
Don't bother.

26
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm not interested

27

in boring things like this.

28
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,370
And if I say I'll let you out for a day off,

29
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,100
you don't care for that either?

30
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,770
I'll release you from the jade tablet,

31
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,230
and you can have fun today!

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,150

Qingge,

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,270
the disciple you said you were going to take in

37
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,040
is Su Yishui?

38
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

39
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,470
That boy's really talented.

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,430
I thought it'd take him five years to form a core,

41
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,310
but he nailed it in just three years.

42
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,030
Qingge,

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,780
he is the son of Prince Ping.

44
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,260
You said Heavenly Sects

45
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,270
shouldn't get involved in imperial affairs,

46
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,800
but why

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,830
did you take in Su Yishui as your disciple?

48
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,000
As my disciple,

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,870
he will no longer be related to the imperial family.

50
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,800
That's not true.

51
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,930
His Majesty hasn't named an heir yet,

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,960
while his condition has deteriorated.

53

My father and Prince Ping

54
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,200
will inevitably fight each other one day.

55
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,720
At that time, Su Yishui

56
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,650
will surely side with Prince Ping.

57
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,250
Someone who has struggled to survive like him

58
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
can't be easily controlled.

59
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,320

his lost son and brought his son back to the mansion.

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,730
As fellow members of the imperial family,

65
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,930
my father chose a day

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,730

Good boy...

69

Unexpectedly, Prince Ping

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
said his son who just returned home

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,430
was feeling under the weather

73
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,090
So he couldn't meet us.

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Then my father

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,040
just had tea and chatted with Prince Ping.

[Little Su Yu]

I was too young and restless to sit still,

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,480
so I snuck out to wander around Prince Ping's residence.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,830
Then I accidentally stumbled into the back garden

80
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,159

I went to take a look.

84

Later I found out

that boy was Su Yishui.

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
Didn't expect Shui

to be such a poor little thing.

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,460
Having gone through all this,

no matter what kind of person he was,

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,020
he's definitely been ruined by Prince Ping.

You should be cautious.

97

Prince Ping treated him this way

98
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
just in order to forge him

99
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,580
into a deadly blade.

100

347
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,070
So are you planning to scheme against Prince Ping?

348
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,550
You have to be more ruthless and callous than others

349
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,720
to stay on top.

350
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,720
In this world,

351
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,350
if you don't want to be manipulated,

352
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,540
this is the only way to go.

353
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,470
No other choice.

354
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,080
Actually, when I was young,

355
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
I almost went astray too.

356
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,810
In that year of the famine,

357
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
some bandits wanted me

358
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,220
to put poison into the well of a rich household in the village.

359
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,420
They promised to give me food if I did it.

360
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,920
I didn't want to do it,

361
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,460
but my little sister had already

362
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,790
been starving for days.

363
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,770
It snowed heavily that night.

364
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,110
I pondered over it all night.

365
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,090
If I put the arsenic,

366
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,360
innocent people would die.

367
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,880
If I didn't,

368
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,510
my sister and I would die.

369
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,650
So you put the poison into the well?

370
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,100
I carried my sister on my back

371
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,960
and fled away on that snowy night.

372
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought we would die,

373
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,550
but unexpectedly, after we left,

374
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,510
we survived.

375
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,680
Shui,

376
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,270
sometimes people

377
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,410
are like

378
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,880
bugs trapped in a box.

379
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,180
They think they're trapped in dead ends,

380
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,600
but once they break out,

381
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,400
they'll realize how vast the world is.

382
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,860
There are always choices.

383
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,970
You've already left Prince Ping's residence.

384
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,880
I will definitely help you

385
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,020
find another path.

386
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,220
I've asked around.

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,860
In the Wester Sect, except for me,

388
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,980
no one else was brought here by force.

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,320
You care about me so much.

390
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,620
Is it because of Su Yu?

391
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,820
You two used to be so close.

392
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,440
As I told you before,

393
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,830
it's because you have Five Spirit Roots.

394
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,520
I want you to teach disciples

395
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,350
and build up a reputation for me.

396
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
This way, I can just

397
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,240
lead a carefree life,

398
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,160
lazing around and enjoying offerings.

399
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,420
You're indispensable

400
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,280
to make my dream come true.

401
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,820
You are indeed so ridiculous.

402
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,560
Have a drink.

403
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,690
No wonder he doesn't drink.

404
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,030
He's such a lightweight!

405
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,270
Junior Su's playing a gentle and soothing melody today.

406
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,880
He's almost like a different person!

407
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,960
Those rabbits and chicks in the cub zoo

408
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,920
are getting along very well with Junior Su.

409
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Really?

410
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,270
Focus on meditation.

411
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Why so talkative?

412
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,830
Weird,

413
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,450
you're about to form your core,

414
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,440
but something's obstructing

415
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,680
the flow of spiritual power in your heart.

416
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Have you ever been seriously injured

417
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,000
or

418
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,710
been hit by any weird spells?

419
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm planting this drop of Spirit Spring

420
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,240
into your heart.

421
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,310
No.

422
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,560
Perhaps there's

423
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,270
a trace of innate impurity in your body

424
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,330
that's affecting your cultivation.

425
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,470
The Westerly Valley in the west

426
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,550
can stabilize spiritual power.

427
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,110
Go there

428
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,210
and wait for me.

429
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,630
Take this pill

430
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,230
and focus on meditation.

431
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,350
This pill I just made is extremely bitter.

432
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,250
Take it with the dried longan.

433
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,210
I've added some licorice to it.

434
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,730
Stabilize your spiritual power.

435
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,730
I'll help you form your Golden Core.

436
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,950
It's done!

437
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,240
The Golden Core!

438
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,920
Shui has finally formed a Golden Core

439
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,380
instead of a Demonic Core.

440
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,400
Shui,

441
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,260
you're now a Golden Core cultivator.

442
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,070
Helping me form my core depleted your core energy.

443
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,870
It's nothing.

444
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,890
What happened to your hands?

445
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,860
Just got hurt while picking the immortal herb for that pill.

446
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,320
The Nine-ganoderma Immortal Herb is quite difficult to pick.

447
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank you.

448
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,890
Well, well, wonders never cease.

449
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,050
Shui actually said thank you.

450
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,260
Honestly,

451
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,720
what I want to hear now

452
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,780
is not "thank you."

453
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Then what is it?

454
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,080
After so many years here,

455
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,310
isn't it about time

456
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,710
for you to call me Master?

457
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,150
Despite my injured hands

458
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,880
and drastic power decline,

459
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,020
-I still can't get you to call me Master.
-Master.

460
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes,

461
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,350
good boy.

462
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,530
Junior Su,

463
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,240
you advanced to the Golden Core realm just a few days ago.

464
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,630
Yet instead of consolidating your cultivation,

465
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,590
you've been grinding medicine here

466
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,960
and making this scar-removing ointment.

467
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,220
What's the use of that?

468
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,280
I...

469
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,940
I injured my hands.

470
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,430
Is it serious? Let me see.

471
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:48,960
Nope.

472
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,070
Shui,

473
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,330
what's the matter?

474
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
It's medicine for your hand injury.

475
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,140
[Prince Zong's Residence]

476
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,920
Su Yishui?

477
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,110
Yes.

478
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,030
Can't believe someone like Su Yishui

479
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,470
would personally make an ointment for Qingge

480
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,790
and lose composure at her doorstep.

481
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,410
He must have feelings for Qingge.

482
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,070
No wonder Qingge

483
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,680
was willing to offend the Eternal Sect

484
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,200
just to take him in as her disciple.

485
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,660
And she even allows him to do whatever he wants

486
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,590
on Mount Wester.

487
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,000
Treating him like this

488
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,390
would make him fall in love, of course.

489
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,010
However,

490
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,350
what's most concerning is...

491
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,680
What?

492
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,070
Qingge is nice to all her disciples.

493
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,590
But her exceptional care for Su Yishui

494
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,720
is indeed uncommon.

495
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,650
Could it be that

496
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,510
Qingge also has feelings for Su Yishui?

497
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,199
With Qingge's free-spirited nature,

498
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,520
how could she be bound by feelings?

499
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,630
Otherwise, I would have

500
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,320
proposed to her already.

501
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,690
I've always kept the position

502
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,850
of the Crown Princess for her.

503
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,230
One can never get love by force.

504
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,340
As the saying goes,

505
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,150
the person by your side

506
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,500
is the one most worthy of cherishing.

507
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,510
Guards!

508
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,120
Give my order.

510
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,290
Starting today,

511
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,969
recruit skilled craftsmen to Mount Wester.

512
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,880
It's time to build

513
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,409
a proper palace for Qingge.

514
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,870
It shall be called...

515
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,130
Consonance Palace.

516
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,960
Understood.

517
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,140
