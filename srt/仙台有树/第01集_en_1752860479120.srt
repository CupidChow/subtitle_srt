The Legend of the Deity

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The legend says that the Deity destroyed the ancient demon god, the Demon King,

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but he was unable to destroy his spiritual power.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He could only seal the spiritual power he had created in the Netherworld.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That spiritual power is the evil thoughts of the Heaven and Earth,

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and it has the power to destroy the Heaven and Earth.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Only the Demon God can release the spiritual power.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Eighteen years ago, Mu Qingge stole the spiritual power and caused chaos in the mortal world.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He led the four sects of the Xuanmen Sect to attack, but they were all his opponents.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sect's disciples, listen to my order!

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Kill Mu Qingge!

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes!

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mu Qingge, I thought you asked me to come here to help you achieve your dream.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You are so heartless and heartless.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You colluded with an outsider to harm me!

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Demon!

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You forced me to become a demon by forcing me to become a disciple!

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How could you have any feelings for me?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You want to test me?

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's see if you have the ability!

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Start the formation!

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are my blood, you are my body.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Su Yishui, your face!

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Su Yishui, you hate me so much!

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Even if I die, you must die with me.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Xishan never forgives the traitor.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Su Yishui, you will never see me again!

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Su Yishui, you will never see me again!

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Mu Qingge!

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The lanterns are light and the wind is light.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The past is unbreakable.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
People are not beautiful, but the world is beautiful.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We are drunk.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We miss each other.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are my tears.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If it's too dark,

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I will follow you.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I only wish to travel around the world

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to travel between the north and the west.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of my love.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am destined to be with you

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
even if I have to go through a thousand times.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I still have no fear or regret.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When the ancient sword falls, the flowers scatter.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will still be with you.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will slowly understand you.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The Legend of Chusen

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Episode 15

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's to say, this demoness

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
even gave her disciple Su Yishui

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
a side-effect of the Heart Wielding Curse.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
She was humiliated to death.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's not all.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mu Qingge used her own life

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to join the sect leader of the West Mountain Sect.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She died and the disciple of the West Mountain Sect died.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's so good.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Su Yishui had to find a transformation tree

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to find her a piece of soul.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
She gave her half a golden elixir to help her revive.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She wanted to open the forbidden order

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of the West Mountain and her.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She could also find the spiritual power

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that she didn't know where it was.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Such a good disciple Su,

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
who was so lucky,

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
had to die for the demoness.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She was so pitiful.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,760
How long does the

86
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,000
return of the demoness take?

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
At 1 p.m., Mu Qingge

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is coming back.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Everyone, please look.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The West Mountain's Feng Yuzhu

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ends here today.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you're worried that the female demoness

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
will harm the world,

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you'd better get ready.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I have a great master

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
who can make a good

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and good person.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He can help the family to be peaceful.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
See who wants to buy it.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hurry up.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Old man Li, who wants to buy this?

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In my opinion, this person is cruel.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Even the master killed him.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's not a good person.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're right.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A good master can do anything.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The evil spirit will rise sooner or later.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're talking nonsense.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're unlucky.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're unlucky.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're talking nonsense again.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's go.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have to get to work.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You...

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Buy one.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Buy one.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Buy one.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yanran.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yanran.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It smells good.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Serve the dishes.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My name is Xue Ranran.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm an orphan.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My uncle told me when I was a kid

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that I was drifting to the village

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
along the river.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then I grew up eating hundreds of dishes.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They say I was a greedy ghost in my last life.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have a special ability in this life.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can make anything

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that I've smelled before.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I like the world in the dish.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I want to see the outside world.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I hope one day

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can eat all the delicious food

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
with my friends.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is my friend.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
His name is Ling Xiao.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know where he comes from.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But we've been living together since childhood.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm afraid that he's not a good person.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We'll live together.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Mom.

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Move aside.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a pity that as I grow up,

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ling Xiao is getting more and more out of spirit.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It seems that he has a very serious illness.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to leave the village soon

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and find a way to save him.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Since childhood,

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
you've been by my side.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Only you are with me.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You'll be fine.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll find a way to save you.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Your Majesty.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Su Yushui set up the barrier of the mortal world.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's very strong.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It took 18 years for Your Majesty

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to find the broken disk of the Dragon Valley.

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now that we have the disk,

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
all the barriers can be broken.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Your Majesty.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is the water from the qi.

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It will be absorbed by the fruit

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
under the rotation.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
After Mu Qingge is born,

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you can control it.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mu Qingge is born with the martial spirit.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll control it.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll control it.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll control it.

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can control it.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll control it.

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll control it.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll control it.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll control it.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Mu Qingge has the spiritual root of the five spiritual roots.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If she can get her spiritual root,

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
she can help you

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
reach the peak of Yuan Ying.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mu Qingge.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Your spiritual root is mine.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This is

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the last fruit of the rotation.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It fell down.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There are two people

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
who have the rotation on this mountain.

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When Mu Qingge was killed,

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
her sister with poor quality

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
was born again.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It seems that she was unlucky

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and was dragged into the nine-tongue fruit.

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She was lucky

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and was accidentally turned over

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
by Su Yishui.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Is Mu Qingge

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the one who fell down

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
or the one on the tree?

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She fell down before the time

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and must have poor quality.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Sister is extraordinary.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She must be the one on the tree.

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Not necessarily.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Su Yishui.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You have been closed for 18 years

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and have no courage to practice heartless Tao.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You have entered the Great Wall.

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You used the half-sword ice lotus to re-summon the golden elixir

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and just entered the spirit of the incarnation.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You can be stable after you pass the stage.

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why do you force yourself to end it now?

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Congratulations, Master.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Get up.

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Something happened to the mountain.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No matter who fell down first,

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I found her.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How could there be a fairy who fell down in advance?

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That evil witch

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
didn't even let her own sister go.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
She squeezed her into the magic tree.

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If she was caught by the dark magic,

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
it wasn't her.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It was the other one.

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It wasn't her.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Ranran.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Ranran, do you know

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the guest who caught the fake number

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is really hard to serve.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But she is really

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
unsatisfied with your skill.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's wrong with you?

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Are you still worried about Ling Xiao?

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Did you save the money

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and prepare to take Ling Xiao

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to see a doctor?

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've never seen people from the school

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
in the village.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I guess

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
someone must have the answer I want.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Someone?

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you referring to Mr. Yu?

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's almost time

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
for Mr. Yu to come and serve the wine.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Every time he comes,

252
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
he orders this kind of wine.

253
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He said it was similar to

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the wine that an old friend liked.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But every time I make it,

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it's a little different.

257
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I changed the prescription this year.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I hope he will like it.

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Yu,

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
every time you come,

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
you always look at the mountain.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's on the mountain?

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's a person who doesn't belong here.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's the friend you said

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
liked drinking wine.

266
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
By the way,

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I added some bamboo leaves

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and blackberry

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
to the wine I made this year.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
See how many

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Wu Tianxian's friends like.

272
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There are three eight-centimeter

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
towns under the mountain.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is the last village.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The noise is a little low.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't disturb the nearby gate.

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's Qing Geng's.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Take it away.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Go.

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Guang Zi!

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The devil!

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The devil has caught people!

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The devil has caught people!

285
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Xiao Cui!

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Xiao Cui!

287
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ling Xiao,

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is this the devil

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that the magicians talk about?

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Xiao Cui!

291
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Xiao Cui!

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Xiao Cui!

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Could it be...

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There are some talismans

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that Lao Feng put in the palace.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's not necessary to be sharp.

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In danger,

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you can take advantage of it.

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This should be the talisman.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's go find Xiao Cui with this wine.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's go find Xiao Cui with this wine.

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
One of you

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
can help our Honorable Superior

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to practice.

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you can't find him,

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you'll all become

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the ashes of our Chimney.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Xiao Cui!

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Xiao Cui!

310
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Xiao Cui!

311
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Xiao Cui!

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Xiao Cui!

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Xiao Cui!

314
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not them.

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How come?

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We followed the order of the Chief.

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Everyone from Qing Geng has been caught.

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Who is the Chief?

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I...

320
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I am...

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Where are the other people from Qing Geng?

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No...

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No more.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No more?

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You know that

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the elixir of the Demon Cultivation

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
requires a few steps.

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
When the real fire is broken,

329
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,040
the demon will be

330
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
burnt to death.

331
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I know!

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's one more!

333
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I know it's the one you want to find!

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Who is it?

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's an orphan!

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There's another one here!

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's a...

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:16,680
It's a

339
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Let's go.

340
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Who is next?

341
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Let's go.

342
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,400
I also heard there's one more!

343
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
The other girl too!

344
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I know it's her!

345
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,800
Who would you like to rescue?

346
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,500
Do you know it's the purple girl?

347
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,700
Let's go.

348
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
The purple girl is taking care of us.

349
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,160
Black Girl,

350
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,480
is quick to go to the 72th七度花车

351
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,220
do you dare defy me for sure?

352
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,020
If you can give me your room,

353
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,580
the third stage will beJE down.

354
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,640
What would you do?

355
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,060
You who failed us

356
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
will be like me.

357
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,460
The fruit of early�

358
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,900
is Siege reason and chill.

359
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,660
The spirit is still not settled.

360
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,220
Don't pull out my hand.

361
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
What's going on?

362
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Go.

363
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
Get her back with me.

364
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Yes.

365
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Go.

366
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Go.

367
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
The evil spirit is disbanding.

368
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Are you afraid of me?

369
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Oh, no.

370
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
The evil spirit is so powerful.

371
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm the owner of the debt.

372
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Who asked you to die?

373
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Who are you looking for?

374
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Don't look for me.

375
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
You don't remember anything?

376
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Su Yishui of Qishan?

377
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
The man who destroyed the Man Yin

378
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
and the man who is so humiliated

379
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
dares to steal people from us.

380
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
You can't keep people

381
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
if you see the truth.

382
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
The truth?

383
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Su Yishui?

384
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Is he the man who killed

385
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,480
the man who was in the mouth of Mr. Su?

386
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
He's not as evil as the evil spirit.

387
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Su Yishui.

388
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
You...

389
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Well,

390
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

391
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I need to ask the immortal to save her.

392
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Goodbye.

393
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
The evil spirit is in the valley.

394
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Your Highness, come back.

395
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Your Highness.

396
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
What are you doing?

397
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Her spiritual tablet is broken.

398
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Luckily, the owner gave her the Demon-Purifying Mirror

399
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
and didn't make the Chimney Street to be blocked.

400
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
I thought the owner sacrificed half of the elixir

401
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
so that the demoness can be reborn

402
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
and can solve the curse between you and her.

403
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
The Demon-Purifying Mirror is a crippling root.

404
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Even the demon beast who practices the cultivation

405
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
can't handle the little magic power.

406
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
She didn't have enough energy in the immortal tree

407
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
and fell down in advance.

408
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
So the spiritual tablet is broken.

409
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
This is a early fall.

410
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,480
It's a good thing that she can live to this day.

411
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
If she dies, who can cure you?

412
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Why don't you force her to enter the spiritual tablet?

413
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
I tried.

414
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
I can't enter her spiritual tablet.

415
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Could it be that the demoness was your master before?

416
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
The spirit of the master didn't break with the transformation.

417
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
So you can't move her spiritual tablet

418
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
with the power of the master.

419
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,480
The Poison-Purifying Mirror is the blood.

420
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
I used another blood to take it.

421
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
The Poison-Purifying Mirror is the hand of the six qi.

422
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Life and death can't be stopped.

423
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
What other blood in this world

424
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
is more important than the Poison-Purifying Mirror?

425
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
There is another Poison-Purifying Mirror.

426
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Wait.

427
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Master, you mean...

428
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Take it as your disciple.

429
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Turn the Poison-Purifying Mirror into blood.

430
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Master, being a master of your master

431
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,480
is a bold and creative way

432
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,480
to leave the Tao.

433
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Master, why don't you reconsider?

434
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
I've never seen anyone in the cultivation world

435
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
do this.

436
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
You have to bear the pressure of the heaven.

437
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
You can't bear it with the blood pressure.

438
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Besides, there are many things

439
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,480
that a master should do.

440
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
You've never been a master.

441
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Can you do it?

442
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Is it hard?

443
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Since you've decided,

444
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
let's go back to the West Mountain

445
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
and do the ritual.

446
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
No.

447
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
The immortal tree has fallen.

448
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
It's too far from the immortal tree.

449
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
It will die in the dry season.

450
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
It has never left the Mountain of Ultimate Bliss.

451
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Go to the Mountain of Ultimate Bliss

452
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
to pick a branch of the tree.

453
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
One more thing.

454
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I can't fight with Wei Zhou face to face.

455
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
You go to inform the four sects.

456
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
I understand.

457
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:26,800
Although the blood is a

458
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
You're awake.

459
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Why is there no tattoo on his face?

460
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
What's wrong?

461
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Do I look scary?

462
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
No.

463
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Your eyes are beautiful.

464
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
But people who are beautiful can't bear to blink.

465
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
You're far from scary.

466
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Really?

467
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,480
I've seen the world that I'm not afraid of.

468
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
There are some people in the world

469
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
who are like you.

470
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I'm just a disciple of you.

471
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
No.

472
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I have an emergency to go to the capital.

473
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
You must have found the wrong person.

474
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
You're the one I'm looking for.

475
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
You were born on the ninth day of the ninth month of the year of Qinggeng.

476
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
You have a plum blossom on your face.

477
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
It will only disappear when you are about five years old.

478
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
You're destined to me.

479
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
You're so smart.

480
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
But the immortal is too beautiful.

481
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
It's not the life I want.

482
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
If you don't go with me to the mountain,

483
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
you will die soon.

484
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Who are you scaring?

485
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
That's my own destiny.

486
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
You don't have to worry about it.

487
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Your life is mine.

488
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
You can't die if I don't let you.

489
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Why do you have to force me to do it?

490
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
The tradition of the New Mountain is to steal disciples.

491
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
My master did the same thing.

492
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Is it interesting?

493
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Aren't you righteous?

494
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Who says the West Mountain is righteous?

495
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
The West Mountain only follows its own path.

496
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
It's righteous and evil.

497
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
It's up to you.

498
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
This is the jade butterfly of the disciples of the West Mountain.

499
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Drop your blood into the jade butterfly.

500
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
If you fail, you will become my disciple.

501
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
No need.

502
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,480
The three masters said I'm not a god.

503
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm a teacher.

504
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm good to the immortal.

505
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Kneel down and bow.

506
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Why are you like this?

507
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
You can just tell me to kneel down.

508
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Can I ask you to kneel down?

509
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Si... Si... Si Sect Leader.

510
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Why are you kneeling down like this?

511
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
I was just saying.

512
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
The jade butterfly is the sacred item of the West Mountain.

513
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Could it be that there is also the remains of Mu Qingge?

514
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Get out!

515
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Sun Shuang!

516
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,480
There's a helper.

517
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Okay.

518
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
I'll see how long you can hide.

519
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,480
The blood vein is really strong.

520
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
What kind of sacred item is this jade butterfly?

521
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
It seems to be able to control Su Yishui.

522
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
That's right.

523
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,480
I don't know if I can command it to save people.

524
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Su Yishui.

525
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
You hurry and go back and save...

526
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
You can leave.

527
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,480
But I guess that if you don't leave half a box,

528
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Wei Jiu will turn your friends into a pair of green eyes.

529
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Immortal, please save them.

530
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
You want to save people?

531
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
First bow.

532
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Immortal, you see that there are people who are already dead.

533
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
They are not easy to save.

534
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
They won't just die.

535
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
If you think about it, compared to the Chimu,

536
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
it's better to sacrifice.

537
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
As long as you can save my friends,

538
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
it's not that you can't do it.

539
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Right, Master?

540
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,480
No father, no mother, no doctor, no reliable person.

541
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
You're willing to be the leader for these people.

542
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Every family here has been kind to me.

543
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
I can't just leave them alone.

544
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
It's settled then.

545
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
I'll bow to you.

546
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
You save people.

547
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Master.

548
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Put your hand on top.

549
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Soul-gathering Poem.

550
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,480
As long as you can save my friends,

551
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm willing to be your disciple.

552
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
If this is the case,

553
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I'll turn into blood.

554
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Go to Master's tea.

555
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Then go back to West Mountain and enter the Xuan Cong.

556
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
That's it.

557
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Help!

558
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Luckily, Master Yu gave me the talisman.

559
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
You're trying to make me a turtle.

560
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
I'll make you fight.

561
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I'll put all my effort on this little smarty.

562
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
The talisman of the Royal Art Gallery.

563
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
It seems that Su Yu is nearby.

564
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
How could she...

565
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Chase!

566
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Go!

567
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Wei Jiu?

568
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
You're good at running into the Crown Prince.

569
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
You're quite bold.

570
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
You've decided to fight against the Art Gallery, haven't you?

571
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
What is the Art Gallery?

572
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I don't even care about it.

573
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,480
But someone has been trying to lure me into this.

574
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I don't want to fall for it.

575
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Master, bad news.

576
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
The masters of the four sects are here.

577
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,480
These old foxes are here just by smell.

578
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Retreat.

579
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Ling Xiao!

580
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Ling Xiao!

581
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Ling Xiao!

582
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Ling Xiao!

583
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Ling Xiao!

584
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Ling Xiao!

585
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Su... Su Sect Leader.

586
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
You're so fast.

587
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,480
How can I drink your master's tea if I'm not fast?

588
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Am I right, Xia Tuo?

589
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Although you're the one who opened the magic chest,

590
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
you didn't save her.

591
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Really?

592
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You were in a hurry just now,

593
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
so you left her behind.

594
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Ling Xiao, give it to me!

595
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Move aside.

596
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,480
This blood jade powder is effective in nourishing the soul.

597
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
This is the blood jade powder that can save Ling Xiao?

598
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
If I save her,

599
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
does that mean I can save your friend?

600
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Forget it. Don't hurt her.

601
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
To save Ling Xiao,

602
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
even if the West Mountain is a mountain of knives and lakes,

603
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I still have to break through it.

604
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
The immortal body is powerful.

605
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I won't ask for it anymore.

606
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
I'll just be a master.

607
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
This is my West Mountain.

608
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I have to get Lu Qiao's body

609
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
and get it to him.

610
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
What are you thinking about?

611
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Master already said that

612
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
the West Mountain is beautiful.

613
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I'll just wait for a day.

614
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
I'll just wait for a day.

615
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
I'll just wait for a day.

616
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
I'll just wait for a day.

617
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
What are you thinking about?

618
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Master already said that

619
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
the West Mountain is beautiful.

620
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
I'll just wait for a day.

621
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
I'll just wait for a day.

622
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I can practice here.

623
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
I'm very grateful to the land.

624
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm very grateful to the land.

625
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I'm very grateful to the land.

626
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Your blood jade powder is like a jade butterfly.

627
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Even if you go to heaven and earth,

628
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
you can still find it.

629
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Don't think of running away.

630
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
You'll die if you leave the West Mountain.

631
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
You'll die if you leave the West Mountain.

632
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
You're threatening me.

633
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Master,

634
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Yu Chen sent a letter

635
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
saying that you personally received the map.

636
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
This is the blood jade powder?

637
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
You come to settle down.

638
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
This spiritual stone can identify the spiritual root.

639
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
The five-shaped spiritual root decides the spiritual quality.

640
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
The more spiritual roots,

641
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
the stronger the quality.

642
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Go and try it.

643
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
I'll go prepare the ritual.

644
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I'm Bai Bai Shan.

645
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I'm from the Xiu Xian family.

646
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I've already tested it.

647
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Ice water, two spiritual roots.

648
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
My name is Gao Cang, the soil spiritual root.

649
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Master and my family have some old friends

650
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
who didn't dislike my spiritual root.

651
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
They accepted me.

652
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
I'm Huo Ling Gen.

653
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
My name is Qiu Xi Er.

654
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
You must be Ran Ran.

655
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
I heard about you when I first entered the house.

656
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
There's another girl.

657
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,480
You were all taken away.

658
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
What?

659
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Taken away?

660
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Master took back the map.

661
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Everyone is afraid that he can't take away the disciple's spiritual root.

662
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
What?

663
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
What?

664
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Could it be that your spiritual quality is extraordinary

665
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
and is a rare martial spirit root?

666
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Do you have to take it away?

667
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Sweet roots and weak roots.

668
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
None of them match.

669
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,480
You're a loser who's not good enough.

670
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
What kind of great kindness do you rely on

671
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
to let Master take you away?

672
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Do you want to know?

673
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Why don't you ask Master yourself?

674
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Let's go to the temple to pray.

675
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Let's go.

676
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Let's go.

677
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Look, it's the sect leader.

678
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Every day, I wear a beautiful dress.

679
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
I look good in a dress.

680
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm a teacher.

681
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
You can't be lazy.

682
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,480
You can't be indifferent.

683
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,480
You need to study and play.

684
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't be indifferent.

685
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Don't be indifferent.

686
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,480
I heard that the school is full of good students.

687
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
This is a very interesting rule.

688
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Can you do it?

689
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Such a rule

690
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
makes me a bright person.

691
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm a bright person.

692
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
I'll try my best to do it.

693
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Why don't I dress up

694
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
in a beautiful dress tomorrow

695
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
and dress up as Master Yi Yue?

696
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Everything is ridiculous.

697
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Can't you see it?

698
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm a teacher.

699
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm a teacher.

700
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm a teacher.

701
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm a teacher.

702
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I'm a teacher.

703
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I'm a teacher.

704
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I'm a teacher.

705
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I'm a teacher.

706
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I'm a teacher.

707
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm a teacher.

708
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
These are all

709
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
from Mo Qingge.

710
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Never learn the chess.

711
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Write in the jade butterfly.

712
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
For Master to check.

713
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
The name is written in the mountain gate scroll.

714
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
The master's Li Ji City.

715
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
You can do it

716
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
according to the power of the spirit.

717
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Once.

718
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,800
Your hideous look is ك clean and terrible.

719
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,680
You're totally not my wife.

720
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,080
Commander,

721
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,480
you're so un 好 oven 面

722
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
The new master has arrived,

723
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
Master.

724
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
I...

725
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,120
I think my legs are numb.

726
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
I can't kneel down.

727
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Su Yishui,

728
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
you're so evil that you want to use me to make a bomb.

729
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Even the heavens can't stand it.

730
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Master,

731
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
why don't you reconsider?

732
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
You have to bear the pressure of the heaven.

733
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
You can't stand it

734
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
just because of the blood pressure.

735
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Let's have a toast.

736
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I'm sorry, Master.

737
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
I'm suffering from the so-called water supply.

738
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Could it be that the heavens

739
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
are hinting that we really

740
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
don't have a fated master and disciple?

741
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Water supply?

742
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Is it hard to receive?

743
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
I don't believe this.

744
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm going to drink this cup of tea.

745
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
And a little shit?

746
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Okay.

747
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I'll drink steady.

748
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Fair enough?

749
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
I'll do it.

750
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
You two,

751
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
sit for a while.

752
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Let's do a round.

753
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
The ceremony is about to start.

754
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Episode 1

755
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,720
Then you will be an channınız disciple.

756
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,120
My disciple.

757
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,040
A disciple?

758
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,960
I can still make you my disciple.

759
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,920
Master here.

760
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I understand,george.

761
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,300
Your ancestral flower,

762
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,800
taste it first.

763
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,720
First,

764
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,920
we need to put some salt in.

765
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,100
So...

766
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,980
You've been選auling ev sizes

767
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,780
for the past 18 years.

768
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,120
It's mandarins that are stinging.

769
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,120
You need to neutralize

770
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,180
first.

771
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,720
Get rid of their chapel and then change your speech.

772
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,920
I thought that seeing you again would be the time for us to settle our score.

773
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,920
I got an answer from you.

774
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,920
It's been 18 years.

775
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I'm still waiting for your answer.

776
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,920
But you've forgotten everything.

777
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm waiting for the day you remember.

778
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm waiting for you to remember.

779
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,920
I'm waiting for you to remember.

780
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,920
I have to pay off my debt.

781
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm sick and I'm sick.

782
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,920
The fate is on my side.

783
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,920
The wind and the waves are still the same.

784
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,920
With you, I'm not afraid of the world.

785
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,920
If I could have a clear mind,

786
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I would be a man without a face.

787
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I can't beat the world.

788
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I hope that I can turn back time.

789
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,920
Why do I have to see the world with my own eyes?

790
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I chase after my dreams.

791
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I want to be with you day after day.

792
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,920
If I could have a clear mind,

793
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,920
I would be a man without a face.

794
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I can't beat the world.

795
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,920
I hope that I can turn back time.

796
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I once dreamed of the world.

797
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
I write the story of love in my heart.

798
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,920
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

799
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,920
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
