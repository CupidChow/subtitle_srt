tell you about the price?

174
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,680
You know it but refuse to say it out.

175
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,690
It must be

176
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,050
an extremely big price,

177
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,240
isn't it?

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,580
Your Highness,

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,610
do you know what this is for?

180
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,750
The flood in Qizhou has been brought under control.

181
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,670
It's because the Surplus Field Decree you enacted three years ago,

182
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,190
regardless of the opposition from the local gentry,

183
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,980
has taken effect.

184
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,200
Both officials and commoners have stored surplus grain

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,730
to withstand the disaster.

186
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,400
Your Highness, this is a great virtue.

187
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,190
The people are endlessly grateful.

188
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,080
Firecrackers and fireworks are being set off in celebration

189
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,670
everywhere

190
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,700
to pray for you.

191
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,200
You still have the people in your heart.

192
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,910
It's Su Yishui!

193
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
Su Yishui is too cunning!

194
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,630
He deceived us!

195
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,150
I will definitely bring Su Yu

196
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,190
back to you, Uncle Ye Xin.

197
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,940
You couldn't even keep an eye on him!

198
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,220
As if I would still expect you to find him.

199
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,630
I know

200
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,930
you've sent people to catch the Green Dragon.

201
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,670
With my energy,

202
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,290
I can find the Nine-Pupil Merfolk Pearl that the Green Dragon

203
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,890
can't resist craving for.

204
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,110
Using it as bait,

205
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I absolutely won't let him get away.

206
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,770
Release Wu.

207
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,320
Let me...

208
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll help you catch the Green Dragon.

209
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,390
Wu.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,960
No!

211
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,810
Don't panic.

212
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,840
Just now,

213
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,550
I merely

214
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,890
helped her unlock her spiritual power

215
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,420
and infused her with power.

216
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,320
After all,

217
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
to catch the Green Dragon,

218
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,540
enormous power is needed.

219
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,820
I agree to your deal.

220
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,000
Wu,

221
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,560
you're fine now.

222
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,390
Just now,

223
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,090
I also

224
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,850
cast a Life-Death Spell on her.

225
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,510
If within five days,

226
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,000
the Green Dragon is not found,

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,240
Wu will surely

228
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,600
die a painful death.

229
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,970
Don't worry.

230
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,690
Five days is enough.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,060
I won't let you die.

232
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,600
Shui.

233
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Ranran.

234
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,350
I'm so glad you're all right.

235
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,170
It's Master's sound transmission talisman.

236
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,320
The library of the Eternal Sect

237
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,240
might have records of the Two-headed Deceptive Python.

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,080
Go quickly,

239
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,330
and remember to be careful.

240
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,680
It seems your master

241
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,150
has already conquered Spirit Spring.

242
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,950
That's great.

243
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,930
Once we find the clues,

244
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,000
we'll immediately go to meet Ranran

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,790
and Master.

246
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,630
Wait.

247
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,810
The entire Eternal Sect

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,480
is controlled by shadow people.

249
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
We need to come up with a foolproof plan.

250
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,350
Oh, right.

251
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
With his Earth-Burrowing Armor,

252
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,220
Senior Bai could even break into the Eastern Palace before.

253
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,810
Now we

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
also have Mr. Zeng with us.

255
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,550
We'll definitely be able to successfully sneak into the Eternal Sect.

256
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,440
Xi'er is right.

257
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,960
We're counting on you.

258
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,260
Look at you,

259
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,550
not bad.

260
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,170
Let's split up and search.

261
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,600
Yes.

262
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,920
I found it!

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
The book says to defeat shadow people,

264
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,340
we just need to find

265
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,630
the first infected person.

266
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,980
After killing his shadow person,

267
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,630
the rest of the shadow people

268
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,030
will also be eliminated.

269
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,630
Great.

270
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,390
Let's hurry

271
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,790
and bring this news back.

272
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,900
Your power has recovered so quickly.

273
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,630
Very good.

274
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,880
Give it to me.

275
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,000
Let me go.

276
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,390
Let go!

277
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
Let me go. Let go.

278
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,790
Let go!

279
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,930
It was just a dream.

280
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,610
My spiritual power has weakened.

281
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,110
He actually invaded my dream,

282
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,030
stealing my spiritual power.

283
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
You still

284
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,290
took the Nine-Pupil Merfolk Pearl away.

285
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,510
Wu!

286
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,020
[Leisure]

287
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,470
What's wrong?

288
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,010
I have some questions.

289
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,470
Do you still remember

290
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
the origin of the Ice Lotus Pool?

291
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,000
Back then,

292
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,720
to suppress

293
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,150
the drop of Spirit Spring in my heart,

294
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,270
you went alone to Jade Peak on Sky Mountain

295
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,470
to retrieve it for me.

296
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,160
Then do you remember

297
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,870
the lanterns I made for you?

298
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,750
Every time I returned late to Mount Wester,

299
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,600
you would always leave a light for me,

300
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,260
illuminating the path ahead.

301
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,770
In the cave at Wuma Town,

302
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,270
you lit up the lanterns

303
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,600
filling the cave for me.

304
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,380
However, in this life,

305
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,600
you forgot the past

306
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
and angrily punctured

307
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,810
the lanterns I had made for you.

308
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Only afterward did you learn

309
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,360
that you were actually

310
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
jealous of yourself.

311
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,030
Then do you remember

312
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,960
how you abducted me to Mount Wester

313
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,970
and how many times I gave you

314
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,160
the wooden hairpin in your hair?

315
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,780
Can you recall all of that?

316
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,750
So,

317
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,440
you're worried about

318
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,770
whether I've regained my memories or not.

319
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,650
I remember everything now.

320
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,980
Every single thing

321
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,270
and every little detail about us

322
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,579
are all etched in my heart.

323
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,480
I will never forget them in this lifetime.

324
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,609
Only when you fall in love with me again

325
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,880
will the Soul-Cleansing Charm be broken.

326
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,510
So,

327
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,089
to avoid hurting me,

328
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,200
you were willing to shatter your own Golden Core.

329
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,860
For my sake,

330
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,180
at that moment when you were willing to sacrifice everything,

331
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,440
you remembered everything, didn't you?

332
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,680
Fortunately, this time,

333
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,960
I didn't hurt you again.

334
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
What do you mean by "fortunately"?

335
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
If I had known it would be this dangerous

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,750
to break the Soul-Cleansing Charm,

337
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,790
I would rather you hadn't remembered the past.

338
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,680
I only wish for your safety and well-being.

339
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,480
That won't do.

340
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,680
If only you remembered

341
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,830
everything about our past,

342
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,630
wouldn't I be at a disadvantage?

343
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,000
Until I became a devil,

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,660
hearing those words you said,

345
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,230
I finally understood

346
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,160
that when you took my Spirit Spring back then,

347
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
it was to protect all living beings.

348
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,880
But it was also because you saw

349
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,510
in the Heavenly Book that I would forever fall into devilry,

350
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,270
ending in the complete destruction of both body and spirit.

351
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,470
You wanted to save me.

352
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Even if it meant defying the Heavenly Way,

353
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,260
you also wanted to change my fate.

354
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,750
I had no idea

355
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,240
about these things.

356
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,180
You've done so much for me,

357
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,010
yet I knew nothing about it.

358
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,510
Shui,

359
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,030
in your nightmare,

360
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,010
I saw your inner devil.

361
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
You've always felt guilty towards me.

362
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,880
You think,

363
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,640
if from the beginning,

364
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,750
I had never met you,

365
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,680
I would have been better off.

366
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,480
Right?

367
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,330
It's not like that.

368
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
Have you ever thought about the exact opposite of your thoughts?

369
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm grateful

370
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
that I can meet you.

371
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Whether in the past life or this one,

372
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
I'm always grateful.

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
There have been twists and turns

374
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,790
along the way,

375
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,300
but in our lives,

376
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,050
how can everything go exactly as we wish?

377
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,440
These experiences we've shared together

378
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,700
actually make me think

379
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,420
each day we spend together

380
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,830
is vivid

381
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
and beyond precious.

382
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,540
♫Maybe a lifetime is too short, too fleeting♫

383
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,800
♫So we were granted a second chance♫

384
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,210
♫Using the unfinished fate♫

385
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,410
♫To exchange for endless reunions♫

386
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,040
I

387
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,440
have prepared some medicinal food for you.

388
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,040
Please eat it while it's hot.

389
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,460
♫Just because I'm destined to reunite with you again♫

390
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,400
Shui,

391
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,400
let go.

392
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,750
♫Intertwined fates throughout reincarnation♫

393
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,850
Respect your master

394
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,270
and listen to your master.

395
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,730
Or I'll have to punish you.

396
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,500
♫With endless time to write our story♫

397
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,310
Master?

398
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,680
Are you the master,

399
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
or am I the master?

400
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,880
What should I do with that?

401
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,740
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

402
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
I took you as my disciple first.

403
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,960
There must be an order of precedence.

404
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,230
♫From now onwards♫

405
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,590
Of course, I am the master.

406
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,520
And you should listen to what I say.

407
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,750
All right.

408
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,960
However,

409
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,880
there's also a term in this world called 'rebellious disciple,'

410
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
and as it happens,

411
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,040
that's exactly what I am.

412
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,680
Dragon Goddess.

413
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,390
It seems

414
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,550
Su Yishui's matter has been resolved.

415
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,190
So I can rest assured now.

416
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,420
Thank you for your concern, Dragon Goddess.

417
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,480
I've caused a lot of trouble for Dragon Island.

418
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,310
You are Qing Luo's lifesavers.

419
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,640
As long as everything turns out well in the end,

420
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
it's all fine.

421
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,920
Qing Luo...

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,880
This reminds me of

423
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,830
an important matter.

424
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,750
Dun Tian wants to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

425
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
Besides several major spiritual channels,

426
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,650
he also needs to sacrifice the blood of the Three Children.

427
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,310
I saw this

428
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,770
on Dragon Island that day.

429
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,360
Dun Tian needs the Child of the True Devil.

430
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,480
That's why he's been trying

431
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,790
to lead you into becoming a devil.

432
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,200
The Child of the Human Emperor

433
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,350
is naturally Su Yu.

434
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,220
But the third child...

435
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,930
The third one

436
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,680
is the Child of the Divine Dragon.

437
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,080
The Child of the Divine Dragon?

438
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,440
I previously learned from Dun Tian by tricking him...

439
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
To open the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

440
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,310
I must gather

441
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,270
the Child of the Human Emperor,

442
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,550
the Child of the Divine Dragon,

443
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,200
and you.

444
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,800
Although the devilish nature within me has been removed

445
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,440
and I will no longer become

446
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,970
the devil's child he desires,

447
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,640
that day,

448
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,310
I still let the Spirit Spring escape.

449
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,240
Dun Tian has been lying low for so many years.

450
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,040
He may have other preparations.

451
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,880
So I think

452
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
Dragon Island should batten down the hatches.

453
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,070
Please be careful, Dragon Goddess.

454
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,310
Qing Luo and the others are playing at the edge of the island.

455
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,110
I'll go call them back right away

456
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,070
and strengthen the barrier around Dragon Island

457
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,030
just in case.

458
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,590
Dun Tian needs Three Children

459
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,310
to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

460
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm afraid he won't let you go easily.

461
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
You still need to be careful.

462
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,460
Let's get back to what we were trying to do...

463
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,000
Something happened at Mount Wester.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,060
Zeng Yi and Gao Cang

465
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,800
have already arrived at the foot of Mount Cuiwei.

466
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,350
-Master.
-Master.

467
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,810
Ranran.

468
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,880
What exactly happened?

469
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,980
There are good news

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
and bad news.

471
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,750
The good news is that

472
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,440
we have found

473
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,030
a way to eliminate shadow people.

474
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,310
As long as we kill the first shadow person

475
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,880
replicated by the Two-headed Deceptive Python,

476
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,030
the rest of the shadow people

477
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,560
will naturally disappear.

478
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,000
In other words,

479
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,550
we need to find a way to identify

480
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,280
who the first shadow person is.

481
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,590
This is indeed good news.

482
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,920
What about the bad news?

483
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,550
We originally planned

484
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,750
to return to Mount Wester first

485
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,790
to inform all the major sects about this news.

486
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,350
But as soon as we reached the mountain gate,

487
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,880
we found blue bloodstains.

488
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,750
I didn't expect they would still attack Mount Wester.

489
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,270
Were any of you

490
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,800
touched by that blue blood?

491
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,640
Fortunately, you gave us

492
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,300
specially made pills to take.

493
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,560
The fragrance of the pills lasted for a long time,

494
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,110
so the shadow people

495
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,710
couldn't imitate our scent.

496
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,330
What about the others?

497
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,880
When we rushed to the mountain,

498
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
we sensed

499
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,660
something was wrong

500
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,960
thanks to the fragrance of the pills.

501
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,480
We were ready to face the enemy,

502
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,440
but unexpectedly,

503
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
we didn't even see

504
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,330
any of the enemy.

505
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,110
The blue blood

506
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,840
rained down on us like a shower.

507
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,440
Many people were affected.

508
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,480
Ms. Wen Hongshan

509
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,130
and Mr. Yan Liangyu

510
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,510
had to find an opportunity

511
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,460
to activate the evacuation formation,

512
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,240
thus escaping with some cultivators.

513
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,200
They're now temporarily sheltering in a manor at the foot of the mountain.

514
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,270
I didn't expect

515
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,560
that Mount Wester would ultimately fail to defend itself.

516
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,480
Fortunately, at Mount Cuiwei,

517
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,830
a barrier has already been set up.

518
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,830
But we still can't be careless

519
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,230
about the shadow people.

520
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,960
Mount Wester has fallen.

521
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,750
The five spiritual channels

522
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,240
are now in Dun Tian's hands.

523
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,000
His plan,

524
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm afraid, has advanced another step.

525
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,110
Right now, eliminating the first shadow person

526
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,020
is the fastest way

527
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,550
to reclaim the spiritual channels.

528
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,280
Who's there?

529
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,030
Be careful, he might be a shadow man.

530
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,040
With such weak spiritual power,

531
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,120
you still dare to lurk around here?

532
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,270
Lurk around?

533
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,450
I'm here to seek cooperation.

534
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
I know

535
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,450
who the first shadow person is.

536
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,170
Let me...

537
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,400
Let me go quickly!

538
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,830
It seems you're not an impostor.

539
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,680
That day, I

540
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,380
encountered the Two-headed Deceptive Python.

541
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,920
I thought it had harmed Tu Jiuyuan,

542
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
so I angrily cut off its head.

543
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,620
My hands were stained with the strange snake's blood.

544
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,910
So you mean

545
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,000
your shadow man

546
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,830
is the source?

547
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,310
More or less.

548
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,910
I am probably

549
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,440
the first one who was affected.

550
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,030
Shadow people

551
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,630
are infected and replicated

552
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,640
by the blue blood of the Two-headed Deceptive Python.

553
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,770
After you killed it,

554
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,590
the blue blood came into existence.

555
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,650
Then undoubtedly,

556
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,560
you are indeed the first one.

557
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,650
You don't know.

558
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,540
At that time, the impostor

559
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
couldn't kill me on the spot.

560
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,400
Instead, it used

561
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,040
another more vicious method to torment me.

562
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,510
He took advantage of your sleep,

563
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,590
transformed into a nightmare,

564
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,000
and stole your spiritual power.

565
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's right.

566
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,660
Every time I close my eyes,

567
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,810
I can see someone

568
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,720
who looks exactly

569
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,690
like myself

570
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,000
choke my neck and feed on me.

571
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,360
What are you looking at?

572
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,000
To guard against the impostor,

573
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,330
I haven't closed my eyes for several days.

574
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,470
What's more infuriating

575
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,280
is that he...

576
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,000
Why do I smell

577
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,430
such a strong sour smell?

578
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,310
I

579
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
have no other choice

580
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
but to come to you.

581
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,760
Otherwise, do you think

582
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,590
I want to come and watch you two

583
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,990
being lovey-dovey here?

584
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,280
Just tell me.

585
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,550
Are all these strange occurrences

586
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,830
related to

587
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,790
that Dun Tian?

588
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,690
That's correct.

589
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,000
Then I finally found the right person.

590
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In the netherworld,

591
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,550
he specifically targeted you.

592
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,150
It's clear

593
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,470
that he's coming specifically for you.

594
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,180
After all,

595
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,310
my current miserable situation

596
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
is all your fault.

597
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,670
Su Yishui,

598
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,830
if you don't solve all these troubles

599
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,200
for me,

600
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,880
and if I'm tortured to death,

601
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,540
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

602
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,040
You don't need to tell me.

603
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,960
Because of the Two-headed Deceptive Python,

604
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,250
so many people have died.

605
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:05,840
Of course, we will

606
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,720
resolve this crisis as soon as possible.

607
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,510
However,

608
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,750
what is Dun Tian trying to do

609
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,750
by creating so many imposters?

610
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,110
He wants to use shadow people

611
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,440
to control the Heavenly Sects,

612
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
open the spiritual channels of the immortal mountains

613
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,750
of the Four Heavenly Sects,

614
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,090
and build the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

615
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,750
Three Thousand Realms Tower?

616
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,080
What the hell is that?

617
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,350
There are truly Three Thousand Realms in the world.

618
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,110
Each realm has its own universe.

619
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,750
In each realm,

620
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,880
there exist different versions of us,

621
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,890
even different Immortal Realms.

622
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,790
Three Thousand Realms Tower

623
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,350
is the entrance

624
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,680
to those three thousand parallel realms.

625
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
In each realm,

626
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
there are different versions of us?

627
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,480
So...

628
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,160
Does Dun Tian want to...

629
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,210
He wants to enter the Three Thousand Realms Tower

630
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,370
to find a parallel realm

631
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,720
that satisfies him.

632
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,350
In that realm,

633
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,280
he didn't choose ascension

634
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,880
but stayed with his wife and daughter,

635
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,010
enjoying family happiness together.

636
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,590
Dun Tian regretted his choice.

637
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,170
He wants to replace his other self in that realm

638
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,030
and start over.

639
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,010
I didn't know such a remedy for regret existed in the universe.

640
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,030
The realms are originally independent of each other

641
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,430
and not interconnected.

642
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,300
If one forcibly crosses over,

643
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,000
there will be a huge price to pay.

644
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,030
That is to completely destroy

645
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,550
the realm we are in.

646
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,110
Only when our realm

647
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,310
becomes nothingness

648
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,400
will a corner of the Three Thousand Realms Tower

649
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,660
completely collapse.

650
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,370
Its passage

651
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,000
will then truly open.

652
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,150
He treated me like a pawn,

653
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,070
using me to help him release the Mortal-Demon Lord's child.

654
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Now he wants to erase

655
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,200
everything I've earned

656
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,110
with great difficulty!

657
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,120
He won't stand a chance!

658
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,350
Fortunately, the Three Children

659
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,200
used to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower

660
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,880
are no longer

661
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,340
under Dun Tian's control.

662
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,960
Now we just need to eliminate

663
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,790
the shadow people controlling the major sects

664
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,070
and reclaim the spiritual channels,

665
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,730
and Dun Tian

666
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,050
will have no more tricks up his sleeve.

667
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,480
Great.

668
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,830
You help me reclaim Mount Scarlet Flame.

669
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,080
Then we'll deal with

670
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,490
the imposter pretending to be me together.

671
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,150
Everything will be resolved.

672
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,630
Let's cooperate.

673
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,030
You're trying to persuade us

674
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,030
into helping you reclaim your sect.

675
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,310
We'll go to Mount Scarlet Flame

676
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,970
to eliminate your shadow man,

677
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,060
but we can handle this on our own.

678
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,880
Your spiritual power now

679
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,400
is so weak that there's nothing you can do.

680
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,310
What good are you?

681
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,830
I...

682
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,730
I know a secret passage.

683
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,210
We can sneak into

684
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,310
the interior of Mount Scarlet Flame.

685
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,840
We'll catch them off guard.

686
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,350
It'll save us a lot of trouble.

687
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,350
What do you think?

688
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,920
Deal.

689
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,120
However,

690
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,480
about attacking Mount Scarlet Flame,

691
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,280
there's still a tricky problem.

692
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
We also need to prevent ourselves

693
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,980
from being contaminated by the blue blood.

694
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,870
These past few days,

695
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,110
I've focused on how to forge Shadow Bells.

696
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,710
If we carry this bell with us,

697
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,070
once something attacks us,

698
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,920
it can transform into a Bell Shadow Barrier,

699
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,270
protecting the person inside.

700
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,960
However,

701
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,260
its energy is still a bit weak at the moment.

702
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,920
I'll find a way to strengthen it further.

703
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,680
It should be able to

704
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,480
resist the attack of the blue blood.

705
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,010
Baishan,

706
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,790
help Mr. Zeng make Shadow Bells

707
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,150
these two days.

708
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes, Master.

709
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,310
Once the bells are ready,

710
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,830
we'll immediately attack Mount Scarlet Flame.

711
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,350
Wait.

712
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,640
There's one more thing.

713
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,030
I do know the secret passage

714
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,360
to Mount Scarlet Flame.

715
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,660
But I have a condition.

716
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,960
Su Yishui,

717
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,810
sleep beside me.

718
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,920
I haven't slept

719
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,030
for several days.

720
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,480
The imposter merely

721
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
uses the demonic power

722
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,560
nurtured by the Two-headed Deceptive Python

723
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,360
to invade my dreams from afar

724
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,960
and steal my spiritual power

725
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,260
when I'm exhausted and defenseless.

726
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,500
But if there is

727
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,450
a strong spiritual power interference

728
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,420
beside me,

729
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,410
he won't be able to succeed.

730
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,970
You help me protect myself.

731
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,610
I'm not interested.

732
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,910
Su Yishui.

733
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,480
We're now

734
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,880
in the same boat after all.

735
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,010
If I'm worn to death,

736
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,820
it won't do you any good either.

737
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,650
You might as well let me

738
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,780
have a sound sleep.

739
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,790
I promise

740
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,550
I'll never cause trouble

741
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,280
for Mount Wester in the future.

742
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,200
Su Yishui.

743
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,560
Su Yishui.

744
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,720
Only you and Mu Qingge here

745
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,330
can help me protect myself

746
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,660
with your cultivation.

747
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,010
If you don't help me,

748
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,720
fine,

749
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,980
I'll ask Mu Qingge.

750
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,910
Having a sweet and soft beauty

751
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,540
by my side,

752
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,350
even if I die in my dreams,

753
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,760
I'll be a dashing ghost.

754
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,960
Beauty Mu,

755
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,750
I...

756
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,270
Come with me.

757
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,480
Could there be fatalities

758
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,010
between Master and Wei Jiu?

759
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,070
Behave yourself.

760
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,300
Don't worry.

761
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,400
Now that you're with me,

762
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,880
I definitely

763
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,960
won't go after her.

764
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,680
Then I'll make myself at home.

765
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,840
You sleep on this side.

766
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,040
I haven't slept this comfortably for a long time.

767
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,560
Get out since you're awake.

768
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
You even helped me

769
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,130
absorb back the spiritual power

770
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,190
from the impostor?

771
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,530
I was afraid you'd slow us down later.

772
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,070
I've always been discerning about kindness and enmity,

773
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,670
and I always repay kindness.

774
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,570
You've helped me this time.

775
00:31:59,310 --> 00:31:59,790
Tell me,

776
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,250
how do you want me to thank you?

777
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,200
Then please do me a favor,

778
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,460
take the quilt you used and throw it away.

779
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,070
I like keeping things clean.

780
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,960
I can't stand it.

781
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,440
I...

782
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm wearing

783
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,810
a brocade silk robe.

784
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,920
After leaving Mount Scarlet Flame,

785
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,000
I specially changed into a new outfit.

786
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,930
It's very clean!

787
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,730
Sovereign Wei, your voice is loud and clear.

788
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,000
It seems the spiritual energy in your Dantian

789
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,060
is quite abundant.

790
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,550
You...

791
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,440
I...

792
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,830
You...

793
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,400
How dare you threaten me!

794
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,350
You were watching Wei Jiu all night.

795
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,950
You must have stayed up all night, haven't you?

796
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,210
I'm very tired.

797
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,170
My wounds haven't healed yet.

798
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,680
Then after having breakfast,

799
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,180
you should go rest for a while.

800
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,960
Don't worry about Zeng Yi and the others

801
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,110
forging magic items.

802
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,110
I'll go help them.

803
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,090
What smells so good?

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Steamed buns?

805
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,880
They're delicious.

806
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,400
Beauty Mu,

807
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,980
did you make these?

808
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,410
The sweet potato chips you made

809
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,250
and gave me before

810
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,240
were especially delicious.

811
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,510
I didn't expect that other things you made

812
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,920
would be even more delicious.

813
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,050
Sweet potato chips?

814
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,720
Back when we were at Heavenly Meridian Mountain,

815
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,210
you were meditating to heal your wounds.

816
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,270
I saw he was starving,

817
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,530
so I just gave him some.

818
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,360
You haven't tried them?

819
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,200
You don't know

820
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,350
how sweet those sweet potato chips were!

821
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,680
Eat your steamed buns and shut your mouth.

822
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,720
Wei Jiu!

823
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,030
Did you drink all

824
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,490
the good wine I had stored?

825
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,010
Since you have nowhere else to go,

826
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,590
can't you have some

827
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,590
decency as a guest?

828
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,500
Drinking your wine

829
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,320
is showing respect for

830
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
your title as the Alcohol Immortal.

831
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,150
Fine.

832
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Let's not talk about the wine for now.

833
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,940
I just saw you

834
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,030
throw away the quilt

835
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,830
that Ranran sewed for Su Yishui.

836
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,330
I couldn't even stop you even if I wanted to.

837
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
When Su Yishui

838
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
was severely injured and unconscious

839
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,320
and struggling with hypothermia,

840
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,230
Ranran

841
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,980
stayed up for several nights

842
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,670
sewing it stitch by stitch with her own hands.

843
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,850
Where did you throw it?

844
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,510
I just tossed it on some random hillside.

845
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,170
I don't know where it ended up.

846
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,190
Where is he?

847
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,710
I've searched for him around the mountain,

848
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,170
but there's no sign of him.

849
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,090
You're quite caring, aren't you?

850
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,740
I didn't know you sewed the quilt.

851
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,760
Otherwise, I would never have let Wei Jiu touch it.

852
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,590
It's just an ordinary quilt.

853
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Just leave it be.

854
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,960
Why bother going to such lengths to find it?

855
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,440
This is not an ordinary quilt.

856
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,320
It's the quilt you sewed for me with your own hands.

857
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,580
It's more important than anything else.

858
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,760
All right.

859
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,320
If you like,

860
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,190
I'll embroider some bamboo patterns on it

861
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,650
for you later. How's that?

862
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,510
If possible,

863
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,760
it would be even better to add a pair of mandarin ducks.

864
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,480
You're quite good at pushing your luck,

865
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,070
Shui.

866
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,800
Don't forget,

867
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
I am the master now.

868
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,840
What kind of Master are you?

869
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,320
You don't even know how to wash a quilt.

870
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,510
Let me teach you.

871
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,600
All right.

872
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,510
I didn't expect such a trivial thing like washing a quilt

873
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,070
to be so satisfying.

874
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,130
Ranran,

875
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,000
you have no idea

876
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,960
how much I cherish everything at present.

877
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,150
So I will never

878
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,110
let Dun Tian have his way

879
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,970
and take everything away from me.

880
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,510
So you two are here.

881
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,430
In broad daylight,

882
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,170
you...

883
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,490
You're both Heavenly Sovereigns.

884
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,440
Instead of cultivating with a clear mind

885
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,840
and striving forward with few desires,

886
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,980
you two have the leisure

887
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,510
to be all lovey-dovey here.

888
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,370
Why are you always such an eyesore?

889
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,270
Sovereign Wei,

890
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,760
you're just being envious of us

891
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,150
because you lost someone you love.

892
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,920
Originally, there was

893
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,590
someone who truly cared for you.

894
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,460
Tu Jiuyuan was willing

895
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,880
to sacrifice her life for you.

896
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,440
Yet you didn't appreciate it.

897
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,880
You...

898
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,710
Once,

899
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,080
she was willing to die for me.

900
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,510
But thinking about

901
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,170
the day on Mount Scarlet Flame

902
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
when she attacked me without mercy,

903
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,960
I dare not to think

904
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,640
if she has already...

905
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,440
You're worried that the current Tu Jiuyuan

906
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,110
is a fake

907
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,530
and the real one has already died?

908
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,950
The imposter

909
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,230
didn't even spare my wife and child.

910
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,030
Then I

911
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,890
will absolutely not let him off either.

912
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,800
Wife and child?

913
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,390
Did they acknowledge you?

914
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,510
You're quite good at pushing your advantage, aren't you?

915
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,030
I...

916
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,760
Furthermore,

917
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,760
I've heard that under the cliff at the back mountain of Mount Scarlet Flame,

918
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,960
demonic creatures are lurking around.

919
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,610
Do you really think

920
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,760
that after falling and losing consciousness,

921
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,190
you could still be alive and well

922
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,520
because you were lucky?

923
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,520
What do you mean?

924
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,070
Are you saying

925
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,930
that she actually protected me that day?

926
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,700
You figure it out yourself.

927
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,120
I came here to tell you

928
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,630
that Shadow Bells are ready.

929
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,760
We're going back now

930
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,360
to save my wife and child.

931
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,670
Whether she acknowledges it or not,

932
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,800
I've made up my mind about this matter.

933
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,480
It's in the direction of the Eternal Sect.

934
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,000
The spiritual channel of the Eternal Sect has been opened.

935
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,530
Without the pivot of the formation to open the tower

936
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,030
and the Three Children in hand,

937
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,110
Dun Tian hasn't given up

938
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,840
his plan to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

939
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,400
Indeed,

940
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,670
he must still have some hidden tricks up his sleeve.

941
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,530
No matter what,

942
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
we must eliminate all shadow people,

943
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
reclaim the Heavenly Sects,

944
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,070
and close all spiritual channels.

945
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,960
Without the Three Children

946
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,840
and spiritual channels,

947
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,170
what can he possibly do?

948
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,380
Have the Alcohol Immortal and Liang Wumeng

949
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,590
stay and guard Mount Cuiwei.

950
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,000
We need to secure at least one stronghold first.

951
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,730
The rest of us

952
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,000
will head to Mount Scarlet Flame now.

953
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,400
What's that?

954
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,720
It's the spiritual channel of the Heavenly Sects.

955
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,380
It should be in the direction of the Hollow Sect.

956
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,590
Dun Tian is about to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

957
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,360
So,

958
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,850
you still want to go to what you call

959
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,070
the most desirable place.

960
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,900
Who doesn't want everything to go their way?

961
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,880
I have too many regrets

962
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
and too much remorse.

963
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,510
Since I have this opportunity,

964
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,380
of course, I want to try

965
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,780
for a different outcome.

966
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,780
Your Highness.

967
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,600
Do you still remember this?

968
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,110
I don't believe

969
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,320
I

970
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,150
can't conquer

971
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,630
this little clay ocarina.

972
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Once I've mastered it,

973
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,050
I'll play it for you.

974
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,670
All right.

975
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,350
Youth is truly wonderful.

976
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,290
Unfortunately,

977
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,880
it's gone forever.

978
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
This clay ocarina

979
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,150
is just an object.

980
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,070
In fact,

981
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,280
it's not even the original one.

982
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,650
It's the memories associated with it

983
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
that can evoke ripples and nostalgia

984
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,230
in your mind.

985
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,840
The place

986
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,520
you mentioned,

987
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,110
the so-called desirable realm.

988
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,440
Does it have all of this?

989
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,690
Qingge is someone you've longed for.

990
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,150
The version of Qingge in that realm

991
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,320
won't share the experiences and memories

992
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,280
in this realm

993
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,480
with you.

994
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,880
So what's the point?

995
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:02,090
♫I'm heading home, carrying a load of firewood♫

996

every day.

1002
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,880
They are singing the praises

1003
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,800
of a peaceful and prosperous era

1004

will last forever.

1011
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,140
Sleepy Poison?

1012
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,360
Why?

1013
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,590
You want me to take this thing

1014
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,840
and fall into a deep sleep,

1015
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,360
so that

1016
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,070
you can kill me?

1017
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,580
My Lord, please spare me.

1018
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,680
I made a mistake.

1019
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,500
I will never dare to do it again!

1020
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,040
When did you realize I was a fake?

1021
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,970
My spiritual power was stolen.

1022
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,970
Did you have something to do with it?

1023
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,560
I know nothing, My Lord.

1024
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,590
I absolutely

1025
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,800
don't have such an ability.

1026
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,200
Please spare me, My Lord.

1027
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,480
Is this the secret passage you mentioned?

1028
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,610
