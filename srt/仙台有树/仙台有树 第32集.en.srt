[Episode 32]

3
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,500
It's such a simple matter.

4
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,030
I don't believe Xue Ranran is indispensable.

5
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,620
With such a small fire,

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,030
it'll take forever.

7
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,680
Guardian.

8
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,430
When cooking and tending the fire,

9
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,590
we absolutely cannot use immortal magic.

10
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,110
Otherwise, the heat control will be off.

11
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,480
Guardian.

12
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,400
Previously, Ranran

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,060
would cook for hours at a time.

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,640
It's all about patience.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
The recipe is indeed complete,

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,020
but why didn't she include the cooking time?

17
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
I asked you to find disciples who can cook.

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,850
Why haven't I heard anything?

19
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,190
Those three from last time

20
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,150
were already the best ones we could find.

21
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,470
The rest

22
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,030
have been spreading rumors about you,

23
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,590
saying you're picky and bad-tempered,

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,850
so no one dares to come.

25
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,770
Keep looking then.

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,300
Why is there nothing here?

27
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,269
Qi-Replenishing Pills?

28
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,779
How come I didn't notice them before?

29
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,560
Master.

30
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,950
Did you miss me?

31
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,260
Don't come any closer.

32
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,220
Master, your hands are so pretty,

33
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,690
so slender and long.

34
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
I've wanted to hold them for a long time.

35
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,950
Why can't I move?

36
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,700
There must be something wrong with those pills.

37
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,950
Master, your embrace is so warm.

38
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,040
Often when I'm practicing,

39
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
I think about

40
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,600
you holding me like this, Master.

41
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,120
This way, I can be completely

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,310
close to you.

43
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,070
Master.

44
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,260
Your heart is beating so fast.

45
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,590
Could it be that you want to...

46

47

Guardian.

48

Guardian.

49
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,070
Who made these Qi-Replenishing Pills?

50
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,120
Those Qi-Replenishing Pills

51
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
were made by Ranran last year.

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
I heard she used Dream-Inducing Herbs.

53
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,600
Whatever the pill maker was thinking,

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,160
the person who takes the pill

55
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,620
will experience the same.

56
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,830
Did I behave inappropriately just now?

57
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,690
Guardian, you were just blushing

58
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,160
and having a kind of

59
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,470
strange expression.

60
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,750
I thought you were sick,

61
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,340
so I tried to wake you up immediately.

62
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,680
Breaking my dietary restrictions,

63
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,010
and also breaking my...

64
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,070
Inducing me to have such an improper dream.

65
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,120
Improper dream?

66
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,390
Guardian,

67
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,860
you seemed quite enchanted just now.

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,409
Shut up.

69
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,190
Since I need to focus on cultivation,

70
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,320
I'll go and sever this ill-fated bond.

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
Where is Guardian going?

72
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,130
Where else could he go?

[Tranquility Pavilion]

74
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,930
Since Uncle Ye Xin made him lose his memory

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,920
to use him for his own schemes,

76
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,720
shouldn't I

77
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
make him fall in love with me as soon as possible

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
to break the Soul-Cleansing Charm?

79
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,040
Master.

80
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,350
Master, why are you here?

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm just here to take back my core

82
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
and cut off your bewitchment of me.

83
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,630
Fine.

84
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,270
Come and take it then.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,830
Haven't you considered

86
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,390
why Ye Xin went to such lengths

87
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,630
to make you lose your memory?

88
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,920
If you take the core from me now,

89
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,120
you'll be playing right into his hands.

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Besides,

91
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,510
one day,

92
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,390
you'll eventually recall our past.

93
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,070
Can you guarantee

94
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,470
you won't regret it then?

95
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,430
It turned out to be exactly as I imagined.

96
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,159
Then I'll take her back to figure things out first.

97
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,090
It won't be too late to kill her and take the core then.

98
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,600
I don't need you to remind me of such judgment.

99
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,270
Your life

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,940
can be ended at any moment.

101
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,390
Why would I regret it?

102
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,510
Sovereign Su, you must be hungry.

103
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,570
Don't be stubborn.

104
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,290
You need to eat well to have the strength to kill.

105
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Alright, alright.

106
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm the one who's hungry, okay?

107
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
You don't want me to die of starvation either, do you?

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,090
Why don't you join me for a hearty meal

109
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,620
before sending me on my way?

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,950
I can kill you anytime.

111
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,200
You won't be able to escape anyway.

112
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,320
Do you really not fear me?

113
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,270
You see, every time

114
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,669
you come here furiously, threatening to kill me,

115
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,730
but you never bring yourself to do it.

116
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,860
Surely, each time,

117
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
deep down in your heart,

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,900
you must be aching, right?

119
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,270
Don't move.

120
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,270
Shameless.

121
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,440
Is this how you've always been

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
as a disciple?

123
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,010
I was even more outrageous before.

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,670
Why?

125
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,390
Are you also eager

126
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
to remember the past now?

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,840
Of course.

128
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,420
How could I let others manipulate me?

129
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,710
But it's definitely not because of you.

130
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,630
Actually,

131
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,150
I've already found

132
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,670
in the cabin

133
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,840
the way to break the Soul-Cleansing Charm.

134
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,100
The solution is for you

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
to fall in love with me again.

136
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,670
What?

137
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,600
Nonsense.

138
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm telling the truth.

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,510
What the Soul-Cleansing Charm erased

140
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,240
was the memories

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,840
after you developed feelings.

142
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,510
So as long as you get your feelings back,

143
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,480
your memories will naturally return.

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
What do you think?

145
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,630
Do you dare to give it a try?

146
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,870
Absurd.

147
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,080
Stop trying to trick me.

148
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,960
Be careful, or I might

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,750
take back my Golden Core right now.

150
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,910
This fierce beast turns out

151
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,360
to be a paper tiger.

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,030
Immortal Master! Immortal Master! Immortal Master!

153
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,550
I heard from the villagers

154
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,210
that you two

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
look exactly like

156
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,200
the immortal masters in the statues.

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I wonder if you are Immortal Master Ranran

158
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,530
and Immortal Master Su?

159
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,840
It's us.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,630
Sir, has something happened?

161
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,240
Great!

162
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,240
There's hope!

163
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,680
Some children from our village

164
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,520
have been taken away by demons.

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,410
Please, Immortal Master, help us!

166
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,790
Please, Immortal Master, help us!

167
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,270
What does that have to do with me?

168
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,000
I haven't even retrieved my belongings yet.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
You're not allowed to go either.

170
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,290
This... This...

171
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,120
Master.

172
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,150
This place was originally sparsely populated.

173
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,870
The villagers were once

174
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,550
plagued by the Nine-Headed Kui'ao.

175
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,720
Fortunately, you brought us here that day

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
to subdue demons and eliminate devils.

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,790
Only then did this place return to peace

178
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,720
and gain the vitality it has today.

179
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,910
Immortal Master Su.

180
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,170
Please accept our bow!

181
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,320
Master.

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,180
You once told me

183
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,960
that the higher a cultivator's level,

184
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
the more responsibility they should bear.

185
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,960
They shouldn't forget how to be a human first

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,960
because they're too focused on becoming an immortal.

187
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,870
Did I ever say that?

188
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,390
Or are you making up my words

189
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,120
to insult me?

190
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,720
Although it wasn't your exact words,

191
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,630
your actions

192
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,010
were undeniably true.

193
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,000
You once risked your life

194
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
to save the people in the capital

195
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,550
from the Green Dragon's disaster.

196
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,080
If you hadn't been affected by the Soul-Cleansing Charm,

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,720
you certainly wouldn't

198
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,360
stand by and watch these villagers suffer

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,750
without doing anything.

200
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,210
Sir, you all go back first.

201
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,490
We'll be there soon.

202
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,360
-Thank you, Immortal Master!
-Thank you, Immortal Master!

203
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,110
-That's great!
-That's great!

204
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,000
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Be careful. This way.

206
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,960
I haven't agreed yet,

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
and you're already making decisions.

208
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,120
Who's the master between us after all?

209
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,440
I know you'll agree.

210
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,960
The master-disciple order is in chaos,

211
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,390
with the subordinate defying the superior.

212
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,320
I think I was too good to you before.

213
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,090
Yes, indeed.

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,300
You were indeed

215
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,460
the person who treated me the best in this lifetime.

216
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,480
Let's go.

217
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,930
There are indeed demons here.

218
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,630
You've already lost your Spirit Root.

219
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,750
What are you going to use to eliminate demons?

220
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,910
I can borrow spiritual power to draw talismans.

221
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,440
To deal with some ordinary demons,

222
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,300
that's enough.

223
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,630
I'll wait here then.

224
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,510
If you die in there,

225
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,290
I can just take the core.

226
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,120
These spotted spiders live in colonies in burrows.

227
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,910
They were originally gentle in nature.

228
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,720
Why did they become

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,150
so terrifying?

230
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
They've become so bloodthirsty

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,650
that they don't even spare their own kind.

232
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,030
You almost died, yet you didn't call for help.

233
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,150
If I hadn't sensed danger,

234
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,720
you would have already become

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,980
a snack in its stomach.

236
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,330
You're so reluctant to see me die, huh?

237
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm just worried about my core

238
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,960
being eaten by that monster.

239
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,610
You say you want to kill me,

240
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,730
but you're so worried about me dying.

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,630
It seems there's still a good chance

242
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,630
for you to fall in love with me again.

243
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,150
You go shut it up.

244
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,600
I'll go save the children.

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,130
You dare to order me around?

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,330
My spiritual power?

247
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,320
The spiritual power you borrowed to draw talismans is mine?

248
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
That's right.

249
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,140
Don't get distracted.

250
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,540
Focus on the task at hand.

251
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,170
Don't be afraid.

252
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm here to save you.

253
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,080
Everything is okay now.

254
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,610
The monsters are all dead.

255
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Well done.

256
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Watch your tone.

257
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,150
I'll give you some candy.

258
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,270
No more crying after you eat the candy.

259
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,200
Do you want some?

260
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,000
Mu Qingge used to win people over

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,860
in the same way.

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,530
Mu Ranwu is following her example.

263
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,360
But judging from her appearance,

264
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,620
it seems to be genuine.

265
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,550
Why has Mu Ranwu changed

266
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,200
after reincarnation?

267
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,850
Ranran.

268
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,750
Yishui.

269
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,670
Yishui, Ranran.

270
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
Are you alright?

271
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,600
That day in the netherworld,

272
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,730
we parted in a hurry.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Have your injuries healed, Elders?

274
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,510
Thanks to your rescue,

275
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,870
they've already recovered.

276
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,800
Why have you come to Puxin Village?

277
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,480
Are you also here specifically to exorcise demons?

278
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,810
We were just passing by.

279
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,950
The Devil's Pill from the netherworld?

280
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
No wonder these ghost-headed spiders

281
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,030
are so violent.

282
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,180
The day before yesterday,

283
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,550
when we were exorcising demons at the foot of Mount Hollow,

284
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,150
it was quite similar

285
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,910
to the scene with these ghost-headed spiders now.

286
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,720
Some usually rare ferocious beasts

287
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,570
suddenly went berserk and attacked people.

288
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,970
Such abnormal events

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,970
occurring on such a large scale

290
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,450
must be part of Ye Xin's plan

291
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,280
to escape from the netherworld.

292
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,860
This is a matter of great importance.

293
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,790
Let's send these children

294
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,630
back home first.

295
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,960
Then we can sit down and discuss in detail.

296
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,510
Since we received your last message,

297
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,390
disciples from various sects

298
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,570
have been secretly investigating Ye Xin's background.

299
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,400
However, this person

300
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,510
is extremely mysterious.

301
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,740
Despite obviously possessing astonishing cultivation,

302
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,800
he has left no trace of his life story.

303
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,960
If it weren't for

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,290
taking in Mu Qingge and her sister,

305
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,120
probably

306
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,790
no one would have noticed

307
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,400
the existence of this person even now.

308
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,940
Moreover, this person is extremely cautious.

309
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,490
I sent people

310
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,240
to follow Mu Qingge for over a month,

311
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
but apart from knowing that Ye Xin

312
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,550
resides in the Eastern Palace,

313
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,790
we couldn't uncover any

314
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,589
other traces of his activities.

315
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,270
If the devilization of these demons

316
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,400
was truly his doing,

317
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,650
what could his intentions be?

318
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,270
This person is shrouded in suspicion.

319
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm afraid there will be more

320
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
devilized creatures appearing in the future.

321
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,750
For now,

322
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,960
we can only follow this lead

323
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,620
and continue investigating.

324
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,460
We will keep a close watch on this matter.

325
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,870
By the way,

326
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,880
demonic cultivators have always been fond of researching evil techniques

327
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,410
and the art of devilization.

328
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,790
I wonder if the Celestial Sect

329
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,310
will have clues

330
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
that we don't know about.

331
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,070
I think

332
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,200
perhaps we could pay a visit to the Celestial Sect.

333
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,130
I'll go with you.

334
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
There's no time to waste.

335
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,360
We'll take our leave now.

336
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,720
Wait.

337
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,270
I have a question.

338
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
Do you two

339
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,950
live here together?

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,130
How inappropriate.

341
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,860
A man and a woman living alone together.

342
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,830
You should know the importance of avoiding suspicion.

343
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,030
Don't talk nonsense.

344
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,680
Yishui and Ranran

345
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,640
have long confirmed their feelings for each other.

346
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,500
It's not like they're strangers.

347
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,040
So you've noticed

348
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,930
what's going on between us.

349
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,620
What do you mean "what's going on between us"?

350
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,140
Yishui.

351
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,880
Since that's the case,

352
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,680
we don't need to hide it anymore.

353
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,890
You wouldn't want people to know

354
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,880
that you've lost your memory due to the Soul-Cleansing Charm, would you?

355
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,810
Just play along.

356
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,360
I just don't understand.

357
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,400
Apparently, both of you

358
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,330
are people of exceptional talent.

359
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,750
As long as you focus on cultivation,

360
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,030
you'll surely attain ascension soon

361
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,160
and embark on the path to immortality.

362
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,830
If necessary,

363
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,830
you can cultivate together then.

364
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,730
Wouldn't that be better without hindering each other?

365
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,530
Why indulge in

366
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,350
these worldly emotions and romance now?

367
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,830
You're setting a bad example

368
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,560
for the Heavenly cultivators.

369
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
This is not good.

370
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,100
Not good at all!

371
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,840
Yan Liangyu.

372
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,480
If you can't speak properly, don't speak at all.

373
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I am sincerely

374
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,440
advising them.

375
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,960
How about this?

376
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,230
After the current crises are over,

377
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,310
we'll have Miss Ranran over

378
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,960
to stay at the Eternal Sect temporarily.

379
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,070
This way, you won't have to stay together

380
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,070
and develop distracting thoughts

381
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,530
which will affect your cultivation.

382
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,830
Xue Ranran will stay by my side.

383
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,920
She's not going anywhere.

384
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,070
Whether we ascend

385
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,110
or whether we become immortal partners

386
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,440
is none of your concern.

387
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,310
Also,

388
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,350
if we set our wedding date some day,

389
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,880
we'll invite you to the celebration, Senior.

390
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Su...

391
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,920
Su Yishui.

392
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,480
It's time to let go completely.

393
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,860
If I remain infatuated with this,

394
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,690
even I will grow tired of myself.

395
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,160
Ranran.

396
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,070
Don't waste the good match heaven has bestowed upon you.

397
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,930
What's meant for you in this life,

398
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,690
I only hope you cherish it well.

399
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,750
Yishui and I would like

400
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,440
to thank you for your blessings, Elder Wen.

401
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Elder Wen, you have a kind and graceful heart,

402
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,200
and a deep understanding of righteousness.

403
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
May you also meet a good man soon.

404
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,710
Thank you.

405
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,370
We'll be going then.

406
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,140
Let's go.

407
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,310
Wen.

408
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,200
Master, didn't you just say

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,440
you wanted to marry me?

410
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,090
How can you abandon me now?

411
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,510
It was just an act.

412
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,750
How could it be taken seriously?

413
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,080
Don't be unreasonable.

414
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,930
Wen.

415
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,380
Slow down.

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,240
Wen, wait for me.

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Those words you just said...

418
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,180
Have you really let go?

419
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,870
I have no other intentions.

420
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,080
I just feel that

421
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,270
after all these years, you've finally

422
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,350
let go of the knot in your heart

423
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,480
and your obsession.

424
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm happy for you.

425
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,750
Thank you,

426
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,640
but it's not necessary.

427
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
I admit that

428
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,270
I had some prejudice

429
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,250
against Su Yishui before.

430
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,240
But he's indeed not what I thought he was.

431
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
I was narrow-minded.

432
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,830
But whether it's 20 years ago

433
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,550
or 20 years later,

434
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,550
this guy always

435
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,750
indulges so much in the worldly pleasures.

436
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,950
It's really not good.

437
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,960
Wen.

438
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,540
Let's not make such a foolish mistake

439
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,200
and delay our path to immortality.

440
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
How about we supervise

441
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,810
each other from now on?

442
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,400
And after we attain ascension together,

443
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,660
we can become partners

444
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,930
and make progress together.

445
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,160
Wen.

446
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,790
What do you think?

447
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,640
You'd better find someone else.

448
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,170
I'm hurrying to Mount Red Flame

449
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,480
to see what exactly is the problem with

450
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,140
the reopened Celestial Sect.

451
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,000
Wen.

452
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,180
Don't you also feel that

453
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
being chivalrous

454
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,680
and helping others is really fulfilling?

455
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,070
That's just who you are.

456
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,920
Xue Ranran.

457
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,460
You've got some nerve.

458
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,750
Now you're trying to lecture me?

459
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,480
Who's the Master here,

460
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
me or you?

461
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Now that the matter of the village is resolved,

462
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,570
it's time to settle things between us.

463
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,510
You...

464
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,310
Don't even think about it.

465
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,040
I'd like to keep my life for now.

466
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,110
How about

467
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,270
we put the matter of the Golden Core on credit for now

468
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,530
and deal with it later?

469
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
You've got quite a few tricks up your sleeve.

470
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,130
Put it on credit?

471
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,680
What's in it for me?

472
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
I can find ways

473
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,920
to help you regain your memory

474
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
and figure out Ye Xin's intentions.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,720
Also,

476
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,630
I can keep you company to relieve your boredom,

477
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,500
and cook delicious meals for you.

478
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,070
All these things you mentioned,

479
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,200
I can do them myself.

480
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,550
However,

481
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,010
I've been thinking,

482
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,110
since I took you as my disciple before,

483
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,110
there must have been a reason for it.

484
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,040
I just accidentally forgot.

485
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,240
So,

486
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,160
you might as well stay.

487
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,640
But I don't keep idle people around.

488
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,770
As clumsy as you are,

489
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,480
the only thing you're decent at

490
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,350
is cooking.

491
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
Just stay at Mount Wester and cook for me.

492
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,720
I'll let you keep the Golden Core for now.

493
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,350
Really?

494
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,200
Thank you, Master.

495
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,880
I'll definitely

496
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,310
prepare every meal with care

497
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,350
and make sure you taste delicacies from all over the land.

498
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,160
Xue Ranran.

499
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,590
Do you think I'm doing this because I'm greedy for food?

500
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,590
I practice abstinence from food in my cultivation.

501
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,240
I've long since cut off my desire for food and drink.

502
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,610
I'm only letting you stay

503
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,270
because I see you don't have any ill intentions.

504
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,630
Before I attain ascension,

505
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,550
having a meal occasionally

506
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,280
to comfort myself a bit is fine.

507
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,680
Got it.

508
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,970
Then why are you still standing there?

509
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,790
Hurry up and pack your things.

510
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,960
Come back to Mount Wester with me.

511
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,760
Only by staying by Master's side

512
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,970
do I have a chance

513
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,030
to make him fall in love with me again.

514
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,490
Just wait and see.

515
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,010
She has my Golden Core.

516
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,510
Of course, letting her stay by my side

517
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,710
is the safest option.

518
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,400
[Supreme Map of Thousand Spell]

519
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,770
During today's refining,

520
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,180
the Spirit Spring in my heart became unstable again.

521
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,960
I need to go see the Black-Robed Magician as soon as possible

522
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,820
and ask him to help me suppress it.

523
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Who is it?

524
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,080
The Black-Robed Magician?

525
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,870
That's right.

526
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,130
This is the Black-Robed Magician.

527
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,160
How come there's

528
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,820
a portrait of a Magician here?

529
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,600
This is a portrait of Ye Xin.

530
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,550
Oh, right.

531
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,390
Last time you came to this cabin,

532
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,550
you mentioned that this portrait

533
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,880
looked familiar to you.

534
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,720
Could it be...

535
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,750
The Black-Robed Magician is Ye Xin?

536
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,750
Which means

537
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,350
Uncle Ye Xin has known all along

538
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,500
that you are the Demon's child.

539
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,280
He was the one who initially

540
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,750
wanted to refine the Demon's child to obtain the Spirit Spring.

541
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,400
However,

542
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,920
even with several Heavenly Sects joining forces

543
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,220
to investigate the identity of the Demon's child, they found nothing.

544
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,420
Why does he know everything so clearly?

545
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
He actually set up

546
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,420
so many moves so early.

547
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,510
I'm afraid his identity

548
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,970
is even more extraordinary than we thought.

549
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,160
Ye Xin...

550
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,350
Ye Xin...

551
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,750
Whose obsession is this?

552
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,860
Dun Tian's.

553
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,550
Chang'e must regret stealing the spiritual medicine...

554
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,000
Gazing at the blue sky night after night with a heavy heart.

555
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
What did you think of?

556
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,750
Dun Tian.

557
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,030
Back then, he slayed the Mortal-Demon Lord

558
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,120
and attained ascension,

559
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,200
but he didn't step in to save

560
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,280
his wife and daughter who were trapped by evil spirits.

561
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,240
After that, he was filled with regret.

562
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,830
He would often go to the Memory Cave,

563
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,480
watch

564
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,270
the happy memories of himself and his family,

565
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,600
and recite these lines:

566
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,550
"Chang'e must regret stealing the spiritual medicine,

567
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,790
gazing at the blue sky night after night with a heavy heart."

568
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,750
"Gazing at the blue sky night after night with a heavy heart?"

569
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,720
The Black-Robed Magician also goes by the alias "Night Heart", which is "Ye Xin."

570
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,120
So the Magician is Ye Xin,

571
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,240
who's none other than

572
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,100
the once-great savior, Dun Tian?

573
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,070
That's right.

574
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,160
I felt that day

575
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,230
the barrier at the Eastern Palace

576
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,030
couldn't have been created by mortal magic.

577
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,800
Now that I think about it,

578
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
only immortal magic could have accomplished that.

579
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If he is Dun Tian,

580
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,200
then everything falls into place.

581
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,680
Everyone thought that years ago, Dun Tian

582
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,030
had already perished.

583
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,110
But now it seems

584
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,960
it was just his ruse to escape from the Immortal Realm

585
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,620
and conceal his whereabouts.

586
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,480
But why did he go to such lengths?

587
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,740
What exactly is it for?

588
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,590
Uncle Ye Xin once said

589
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,100
that he adopted us sisters

590
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,930
because we resembled his two daughters.

591
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,940
These past few days, I've been searching through

592
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,400
some notes he left behind.

593
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,330
They contain scattered records of

594
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,070
some universe-reversing, heaven-defying techniques.

595
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,590
Connecting all of this,

596
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,270
it seems like he's been trying to do something

597
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,730
to make up for his regrets.

598
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,530
Dun Tian's wife and daughter

599
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,030
have been dead for hundreds of years.

600
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,790
The Reincarnation Tree can't be used.

601
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,000
If he wanted to resurrect them

602
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,200
or turn back time,

603
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,070
it would indeed be

604
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,200
an unimaginable heaven-defying act.

605
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,960
I finally managed to use the death escape technique

606
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,350
to deceive the Immortal Realm

607
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,080
and return to the mortal world.

608
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,080
I'll use this identity for now.

609
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,500
As long as I don't use immortal power,

610
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,330
I shouldn't be detected.

611
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,430
Demon's child.

612
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,890
Spirit Spring.

613
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,160
The sooner I find you,

614
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,900
the sooner I can realize my plan

615
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,070
and bring you back.

616
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

617
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,000
You say

618
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,950
you can help me conquer the universe?

619
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,370
That's correct.

620
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,190
First, you need to obtain the Demon's child,

621
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,370
which means you need to find

622
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,690
your lost son,

623
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,590
Su Yishui.

624
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,310
This drop of Spirit Spring

625
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,310
is a relic of the Celestial Sect.

626
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,680
Infusing it into the Demon's child

627
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,350
will ensure absolute success.

628
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
Yu'er. Wan'er.

629
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,340
It won't take much longer.

630
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,920
I'm close to success.

631
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
When that time comes,

632
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,400
you'll be just like them,

633
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,830
staying by my side every day.

634
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,110
Mu Qingge.

635
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,590
If I had known you'd be this much trouble,

636
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,720
I wouldn't have taken you in back then.

637
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,510
You want to seal the Spirit Spring back into the netherworld?

638
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,550
I won't allow it.

639
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,590
It seems if we want to fully activate

640
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,850
the ancient formation

641
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,510
and seal the Spirit Spring,

642
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,310
only the Demon's child can do it.

643
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,680
Which fallen immortal are you?

644
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,590
I didn't expect

645
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,990
you'd come to the netherworld.

646
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,350
Uncle Ye Xin.

647
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,090
Qingge.

648
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,740
Hand the Spirit Spring over to me.

649
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,750
Sure enough, you're also after the Spirit Spring.

650
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,090
I see.

651
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,130
I should have known.

652
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,400
Your immortal powers are profound,

653
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,460
unlike those of mortal cultivators.

654
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,810
So you really are from the Immortal Realm.

655
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,440
For the sake of our years together,

656
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,960
I won't kill you.

657
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,780
Hand over the Spirit Spring quickly!

658
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,600
Thank you for raising me, Uncle Ye Xin.

659
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,990
But even if it's you

660
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,580
who want to harm the mortal world,

661
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,200
I won't allow it.

662
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,880
You're no match for me.

663
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
I made a lot of preparations before coming.

664
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,310
Although I can't activate the ancient formation

665
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,840
and seal the Spirit Spring,

666
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,040
I can still

667
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,270
use its power

668
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,640
to seal an immortal.

669
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,910
Mu Qingge.

670
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,030
Since I secretly left the Immortal Realm,

671
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,360
my immortal powers were already limited.

672
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,350
Besides, my true self is sealed.

673
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,270
This avatar left in the mortal world

674
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,350
can't exert much power.

675
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,390
I'll wait.

676
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,560
As long as the Demon's child

677
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,720
and the Spirit Spring are still there,

678
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,460
there's another chance for everything.

679
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm almost there.

680
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,440
I'll soon be able to

681
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,790
start everything over.

682
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
Does the recent demon surge everywhere

683
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,110
have anything to do with you?

684
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,650
Your Highness.

685
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,490
What are you talking about?

686
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,070
You know what I need

687
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,200
in our plan.

688
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,790
It has nothing to do with the demon surge at all.

689
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,920
It better not be you.

690
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,290
Remember,

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,440
I don't care what you do,

692
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,160
but you must not harm

693
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,690
my people in the slightest.

694
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,830
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

695
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,290
I will definitely help you

696
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,350
achieve your wishes, Your Highness.

697
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,960
Good.

698
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,590
I'll wait for your good news.

699
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,110
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

700
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,370
He may seem compliant,

701
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,550
but he's in no way

702
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,010
an easy person to control.

703
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,770
All under heaven bustling,

704
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,880
all for profit.

705
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,070
As long as I can get what I want,

706
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,640
nothing else matters to me.

707
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,970
What about the demon surge?

708
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,310
You went behind Su Yu's back

709
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,040
and had me secretly promote it.

710
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,720
What's the purpose of that?

711
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,410
When the demon surge rises,

712
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,110
those Heavenly righteous sects

713
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,510
will surely take action.

714
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
By then,

715
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,590
I will be able to obtain

716
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,510
what I want.

717
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,560
What kind of

718
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,000
heaven-defying method in this world

719
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,560
could possibly bring Dun Tian's wife and daughter back to life

720
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,690
and change the past?

721
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,200
Could it be related to

722
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
the current demon surge?

723
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,480
No matter what Dun Tian does,

724
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,960
he has been scheming against me

725
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,290
since over 20 years ago.

726
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,240
Now he has placed

727
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,040
the Soul-Cleansing Charm on me.

728
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,960
I must settle this score

729
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,640
with him.

730
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,000
Dun Tian wants you to lose your memory

731
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,160
and forget your emotions.

732
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
He must have some ulterior motives.

733
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,720
His repeated schemes against you

734
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,780
are truly vicious.

735
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,760
In that case,

736
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,630
we must not let his plot succeed.

737
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,030
We must remove the Soul-Cleansing Charm as soon as possible.

738
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,670
Are you trying to provoke me?

739
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,000
I do have my own agenda,

740
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,440
but what's more important now is that

741
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,070
the only way to restore your memory

742
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,199
is for you to fall in love with me again.

743
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,070
Master.

744
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,420
Why don't you take a small loss

745
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,080
and make a little sacrifice?

746
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,030
Let me have a try.

747
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,360
It's not impossible.

748
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,800
Let me see what you're capable of.

749
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,260
Go ahead and try your best.

750
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
So you've agreed?

751
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,760
These...

752
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,930
These little tricks

753
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,610
won't be enough to move me.

754
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,070
No rush.

755
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,110
Let's take it one step at a time.

756
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,320
We'll do everything

757
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,410
we've done before all over again.

758
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
It smells so good.

759
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,730
Eat up.

760
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,090
It's really delicious.

761
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,550
What madness has come over me?

762
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,360
Why am I crowded here with a bunch of mediocre people,

763
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,990
eating a bowl of pig offal soup?

764
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,140
What kind of person is this?

765
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,200
Exactly. Let's go.

766
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,100
Xue Ranran.

767
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,400
So you used

768
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,530
this kind of stuff to seduce me before?

769
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,710
You used to

770
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,190
take me to places like this

771
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,450
for meals all the time.

772
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,800
Forget it.

773
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,280
This is all to complete

774
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
the task of recovering my memories.

775
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,400
Master.

776
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
Try the chili oil here,

777
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,000
together with this hot soup.

778
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,260
I guarantee you'll find it worth coming.

779
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,890
I never eat spicy food.

780
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,320
You don't eat spicy food?

781
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,510
If there's anything you want to eat,

782
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,010
buy it and take it back to Mount Wester to eat.

783
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,880
Don't ever bring me

784
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,410
to such noisy places again.

785
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,760
You keep saying you love me,

786
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,550
but you don't even know

787
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,410
what I dislike?

788
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,710
I've never

789
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,690
heard you mention that before.

790
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,840
I'm afraid you weren't

791
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,240
really sincere towards me before, either.

792
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,030
Also,

793
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
Mount Wester isn't short of money.

794
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,480
From now on, get rid of

795
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,810
these shabby clothes.

796
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,440
But you used to

797
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,190
like it a lot

798
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,650
when I wore these clothes.

799
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
They're hideous.

800
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,230
Turns out Master

801
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,360
doesn't really like places like this.

802
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,820
Before, in Wuma Town,

803
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,480
it was even noisier than here.

804
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,800
Some places even required queuing

805
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,280
for an hour to get in,

806
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,130
yet he never showed even a hint of disdain.

807
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,710
At Chen's Pan-fried Bun Shop,

808
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,150
he also happily said he liked

809
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,880
the chili oil I mixed for him.

810
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,080
So in fact,

811
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,280
all of that was to accompany me

812
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,230
and make me happy.

813
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,190
He intentionally changed for that.

814
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,960
Master.

815
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,920
From now on, feel free

816
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,320
to tell me what you like

817
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
and dislike.

818
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,340
You don't have to consider me in everything.

819
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,380
Is that a newly thought-up

820
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,650
trick to please me?

821
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,320
I suppose so.

822
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,230
Since you don't like it here,

823
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,030
let's go then.

824
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
But you haven't finished eating yet.

825
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
A little while longer won't hurt.

826
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I'll wait for you.

827
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,630
Master.

828
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
You're still the same as before.

829
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,770
I'm just trying to complete the task

830
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,000
and regain my feelings and memory sooner.

831
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's good for both of us.

832
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Bear that in mind.

833
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,840
Got it.

834
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,360
You go wait for me at the village entrance.

835
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,960
I'll go buy some things

836
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,480
to take back to Mount Wester.

837
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,030
I'm off.

838
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,810
Don't keep me waiting.

839
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,710
Got it.

840
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,190
Come on, Miss.

841
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,850
Take a look.

842
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,190
Boss.

843
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,380
How much is this?

844
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,370
Five cash, Miss.

845
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,630
Selling pastries here.

846
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,380
What would you like, Miss?

847
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,550
I'll have a pastry, please.

848
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,210
No problem.

849
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,840
That'll be three cash in total.

850
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,880
Okay.

851
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Here you go.

852
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,590
Thank you.

853
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,190
Take care.

854
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,440
Don't rush.

855
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,790
One at a time, please.

856
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,960
This is mine.

857
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,960
Madam Battle is recruiting disciples?

858
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,920
I was born in the twelfth lunar month

859
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,050
between 11 pm to 1 am.

860
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,760
Good.

861
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,840
You stay.

862
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,690
Okay, okay.

863
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,400
Your birth time doesn't match.

864
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Leave.

865
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,320
Only accepting disciples born during Yin hours.

866
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,840
So they don't care about background

867
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,110
and spiritual channel,

868
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,190
only about birth time?

869
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,030
We only want those born in the twelfth lunar month

870
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,160
between 11 pm to 1 am.

871
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,190
Those are all

872
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,030
birth times with the strongest Yin energy.

873
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,630
What exactly is Mu Ranwu

874
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,670
up to?

875
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,960
Your birth time doesn't match.

876
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,480
I am...

877
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,610
Wang Suizhi?

878
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,920
This unworthy disciple, Wang Suizhi,

879
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,050
greets you, Master.

880
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,640
So you know everything now.

881
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,170
Please rise.

882
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,400
I am now Xue Ranran,

883
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,890
and I don't remember much about the past.

884
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,850
Even if you don't remember,

885
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,240
Master,

886
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
you will always be my Master.

887
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,080
I have let you down, Master.

888
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,740
I have committed a grave offense.

889
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,320
I knew

890
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,960
that Mu Qingge in the palace was an impostor,

891
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,820
yet I stayed by her side all along.

892
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,640
This disciple

893
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,360
has failed you, Master.

894
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,510
You haven't failed me in any way.

895
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,070
I'm fine now, aren't I?

896
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,640
It's just that

897
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,840
I don't understand.

898
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,920
Since you already

899
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
knew everything,

900
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,430
why did you still choose to stay by her side?

901
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,630
You...

902
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,030
Could it be...

903
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Does she know

904
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,710
about your feelings for her?

905
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,920
All I want is

906
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,640
to silently stay by her side

907
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,160
and protect her.

908
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,430
That's enough for me.

909
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,720
She doesn't need to know.

910
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,510
Having feelings for someone

911
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,840
and wanting to protect that person

912
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,230
is not wrong.

913
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,190
Since you've already decided

914
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,590
to stay by her side,

915
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,650
I have only one request,

916
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,920
that is to maintain your principles.

917
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,120
Keep an eye on Mu Ranwu

918
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,440
and help her.

919
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,670
Don't let her go astray again.

920
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,360
I will

921
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,620
definitely follow your instructions, Master.

922
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
By the way,

923
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,400
do you know about someone

924
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,590
named Ye Xin who is close to Mu Ranwu?

925
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,030
Recently,

926
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,710
the Immortal Master

927
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
who was always by Crown Prince Su Yu's side

928
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,510
has suddenly been replaced by someone else.

929
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,190
That person

930
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,840
indeed has some interactions with Ranwu.

931
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,630
I think

932
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,980
he must be the Ye Xin

933
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,880
that you mentioned, Master.

934
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,710
So Ye Xin has indeed

935
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,310
been by their side all along.

936
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,800
Actually, we have just

937
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,060
recently deduced that

938
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,960
this Ye Xin

939
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,480
is actually Dun Tian.

940
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,920
Dun Tian?

941
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,230
Since he escaped from the netherworld,

942
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,370
there have been demons being devilized everywhere.

943
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,440
Mu Ranwu has also suddenly started

944
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,640
recruiting disciples on a large scale.

945
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,280
I always have a feeling that all of this

946
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,480
is not a coincidence.

947
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,800
Have you noticed anything unusual

948
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
while being around Mu Ranwu?

949
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,960
Ranwu always goes to see him

950
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,920
alone.

951
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,230
As for what they've said

952
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,960
or done,

953
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
I have no idea.

954
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,630
Dun Tian is planning to do

955
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,160
something heaven-defying.

956
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,960
After all, we were once sisters.

957
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,280
I don't want her to be dragged into

958
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,440
Dun Tian's schemes.

959
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,110
Deep down,

960
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,400
I still hope she can

961
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,930
let go of all her obsessions

962
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
and resentments,

963
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,030
and live a peaceful new life.

964
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,260
If there's any unusual movement,

965
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,510
I will do my utmost

966
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,500
to stop her

967
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,590
from making mistakes again.

968
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,050
As for Dun Tian's matters,

969
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,760
I will also investigate secretly.

970
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,920
As soon as I have any news,

971
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,320
I will send you a message.

972
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,360
Thank you.

973
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,360
You must also be careful.

974
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,150
Master.

975
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
We can go back now.

976
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
I've got gifts

977
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,280
for everyone.

978
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
We've only been gone for a few days,

979
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,740
and you're already bringing gifts for them?

980
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,920
Of course.

981
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
I've always heard people say

982
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,970
that when you go on a long journey,

983
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,230
you should bring back gifts

984
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,560
for family and friends.

985
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,440
I didn't have much family growing up,

986
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,360
and I never had the chance to travel far.

987
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,880
But now, things are different.

988
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,210
Mount Wester is my home.

989
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,610
Since I've come out,

990
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,710
of course I should bring back gifts

991
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,970
for important people.

992
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,160
Important people?

993
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,800
This is for Xi'er.

994
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,360
This is for Mr. Yu Tong.

995
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,620
This is for Senior Bai.

996
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,920
This is for Senior Gao.

997
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,480
And

998
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,320
this is for Mr. Zeng.

999
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,070
And this one.

1000
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,330
This is for Mr. Yu Chen.

1001
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,890
What about this one?

1002
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,710
This is

1003
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,360
some jerky I bought for Bai.

1004
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,760
I also bought some for Huang down the mountain

1005
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,690
while I was at it.

1006
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,760
Didn't you say it was for important people?

1007
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,560
Why are there also cats and dogs?

1008
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,080
Bai and Huang are

1009
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,570
also very important to me.

1010
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,180
Fine. Let's get going.

1011
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,280
Alright.

1012
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,760
This

1013
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,830
is for you, Master.

1014
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,280
Look at this little angry figure.

1015
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,030
Doesn't it look just like

1016
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,920
you, Master?

1017
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,030
Next time you feel like getting angry,

1018
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,560
just give it a good squeeze.

1019
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,550
Childish.

1020
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,440
Who would like such a thing?
