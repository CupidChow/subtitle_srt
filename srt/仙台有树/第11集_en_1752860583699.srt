2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel a few times

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel between the north and the west.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
Even if I have to go through hundreds of turns

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
and be destined to be loved by many people,

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,800
I will not regret or regret.

9
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,600
When the fallen flowers wither and the people change their minds,

10
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I will slowly get to know you.

00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Ran Ran.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I can smell the strong and strong smell of the pot almost burning.

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Is there anything troubling you?

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Can I help you?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,800
I said, don't be surprised.

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
You are the Fairy Tree, Ling Guo?

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't worry. I will help you keep this secret.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
But your touch is no different from our flesh and body.

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Is it because of Master that I can't tell you where you come from

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
and can't feel your past?

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
So I am worried.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
After all, without Master, there is no Xue Ran Ran.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Master has been kind to me.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
What can I complain about Master?

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
But I am a little empty-hearted.

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Master must have his reasons for doing so.

30
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
And he didn't stop me from searching for the answer.

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I have to rely on myself to send Ling Xiao back safely.

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Someone has to be more sincere and care about you

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
to be able to separate the soul and protect you, accompany you and support you.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Increase your cultivation and help Ling Xiao to use his soul power.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
To exchange for his memories and connections with the soul master.

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I will find the answer!

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I was watching the disciples of Wei Jiu.

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Wei Jiu didn't get the spiritual power after he got the secret stone.

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
So he was angry and ambushed Su Yishui.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
But he still lost to Su Yishui.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
So to speak, the spiritual power is not enough.

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Even Mu Qingge doesn't know where the spiritual power is.

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
This is troublesome.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
This witch is a trickster.

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I can't trust her.

46
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I have to ask her clearly.

47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I came from Jiuhua Mountain.

48
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
The immortal locked me in the tower.

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Am I standing on the cliff

50
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
on the side of the Xuanmen road?

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Can't I still let the immortal rest assured?

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
If you tell me where the spiritual power is,

53
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
it will completely relieve my worries about the Xuanmen.

54
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Why do I have to suffer here?

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I was in the rain and the soul was burnt.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I really don't know where the spiritual power is.

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I have no use for the spiritual power.

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I can't even feel the spiritual power.

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
If you really don't know,

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
you can't help but stay here for a few more days.

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
You will be completely cleansed of your demon bone.

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
The spiritual power is no longer in your clothes.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Let's talk about the future.

64
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
At that time, the immortal was so obsessed with killing the evil.

65
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
He could only progress to the south of the Yuan Yin.

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
In ten days,

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
the heavenly calamity will be over.

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Qingge is willing to help the real person.

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
The spiritual power still hasn't responded.

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Why don't we take the time to get the demon secret stone back?

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
So that we don't have to run away.

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
When did you...

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
When the demon Tengxi saved the spiritual power,

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
he hid the secret stone in the room.

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I took it back.

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Then, the soul...

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
He declared that I have the Five Great Mountains.

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I accidentally fell into the tea spirit spell in his room.

79
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
He only noticed the spiritual power that I had taken away.

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Tea spirit spell?

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Then can you monitor his spiritual power at any time?

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
The power of the spirit originates from the Xuantian tribe.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
The mountain is open and the human and demon are dead.

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Wei Jiu is the queen of the Xuantian tribe.

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
He only wants the spiritual power.

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
If he fails,

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
he will have to find the way to the demon cultivation

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
to find the source of the spiritual power.

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
It's not wrong to keep an eye on him.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
No wonder Wei Jiu said that you are cunning and cunning.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
No matter how urgent the spiritual power is, we have to wait.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
We still have to solve the trouble of the soul-locking lock.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
But the spiritual power of Ranran is not enough.

94
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
It's hard to trigger it.

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Fortunately, you absorbed Wei Jiu's elixir of the elixir.

96
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You can manipulate the water of the yard to suppress Mu Ranwu's spiritual power.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
He was also trapped in Jiuhua Sect.

98
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
It's not enough to threaten Ranran.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
The elixir is hard to control.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
We can't let it go.

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The master used the demon sugar to deal with Wei Jiu.

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
That's the demon power that is forbidden by the law of the right path.

103
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't shout out loudly.

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,800
How can I not shout out when the master used the demon power?

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
If Wei Jiu publicizes the matter of the master using the demon power,

106
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
what should we do?

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Wei Jiu is more afraid of this matter being publicized.

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Senior Brother,

109
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
if the master hadn't used the magic trick,

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
we would have all been killed by Wei Jiu.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Of course I know that.

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
But...

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
But that's the demon power.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
And...

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
And I never thought that

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
the master who is usually so wise

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
would be like this.

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
It's the right path.

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
It depends on what he did.

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
The master used the sugar to deal with the demon to protect us.

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
To eliminate the demon and to save people,

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
how is that not in line with the right path?

123
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
The master is amazing.

124
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Master.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Everything has its own ways of growing.

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
The demon is the first to be set aside.

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,800
How can the one who can save people's lives be considered a demon?

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,800
But I can cultivate this kind of powerful demon power.

129
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
You can't.

130
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Remember?

131
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yes, Master.

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
You have 10 days to learn the basic skills.

133
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Today, you can challenge the highest level of skills.

134
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
The fruit of the single tree, the land of cultivation,

135
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
the seed of the family, the essence of the heaven, and the water of the jade.

136
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
These are all the best spiritual treasures.

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
The master is willing to teach us to practice.

138
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Think about how to use these spiritual treasures.

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It's hard to cultivate the power of the single tree.

140
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
What about the elixir?

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Mu Qingge's elixir is talented.

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
No one can beat him.

143
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
If Ran Ran can cultivate it into a spirit elixir,

144
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
can the master be the same as Ran Ran?

145
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I think the elixir is a demon

146
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
after he just entered the house.

147
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm sure that no one can take away

148
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
what belongs to him in his golden pot.

149
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Master.

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I have a question.

151
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Can you allow me to go down the mountain

152
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,800
to visit my relatives this mid-autumn festival?

153
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I'll go down the mountain with you for three days.

154
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Don't forget to study.

155
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Thank you, Master.

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You're welcome.

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Everyone has a family reunion.

158
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I have no one to return to.

159
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I just need you to accompany me, Lin Xiang.

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Who says you don't have a family?

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Master.

162
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Plant it.

163
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Someone told me before

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
that if you plant a tree somewhere,

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
it means you have a family there.

166
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
The West Mountain will be your home.

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
You will no longer be homeless.

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I...

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I will have a home too.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
He will also force me to go to the West Mountain.

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I will go to the West Mountain.

172
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
He will also force me to follow you.

173
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
May everything go well with you.

174
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
What is this?

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
It smells good.

176
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It even has a little pepper smell.

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
This is moon cake.

178
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
It's hard to make.

179
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Just eat it.

180
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
If you don't want to eat it, just cook it.

181
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Master made it for me.

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I want to eat it.

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Thank you, Master.

184
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Master, your moon cake is very crispy.

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I've never eaten something like this before.

186
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
So?

187
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
As a reward,

188
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I know that a moon cake is very delicious.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Take me to try it.

190
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Go ahead, Master.

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
You can't be in the top three if you hesitate.

192
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Master, try it.

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Try it.

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
The moon cake here is really delicious.

195
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm so happy to have you here.

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Master,

197
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
let's spend every mid-autumn festival together.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Every year?

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Yes.

200
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
What else do you want to do now?

201
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
I finally went down the mountain.

202
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
There is a place I really want to go.

203
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Let's go.

204
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Of course,

205
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Master worried me a lot these days.

206
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
But now that I see you,

207
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm relieved.

208
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I didn't expect

209
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
that I would go up the mountain to practice.

210
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I didn't expect that either.

211
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm the most new student, Xue Ran Ran.

212
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I actually have a fairy tale.

213
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
You're used to living in the mountains.

214
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
I saw your master.

215
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
He was sick.

216
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Don't worry.

217
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Master is afraid that I'm alone in the mountains.

218
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
He went down the mountain with me to celebrate the festival.

219
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
He bought all these delicious food.

220
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Really?

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
He also took me to a tree in the West Mountain.

222
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I'll have a home in the West Mountain from now on.

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Since that, I'm relieved.

224
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Ran Ran,

225
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
remember to come and see me in the future.

226
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I've walked this road

227
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
thousands of times before.

228
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Today, it's very different.

229
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Today, I have a master with me.

230
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
He also helped me follow this road.

231
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
It's really good.

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Are you going back now?

233
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
No.

234
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
I suddenly thought of one thing.

235
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
You forgot something?

236
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
If you forgot something, go and buy it.

237
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
No, you can't buy it.

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You have to steal it.

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Steal?

240
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
There's a custom in my hometown.

241
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
For women who are not married,

242
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
as long as they steal good onions

243
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
in other people's vegetable fields on Mid-Autumn Festival night,

244
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
they can marry a good husband in the future.

245
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
So if you don't steal the onions,

246
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
this Mid-Autumn Festival is not a full-fledged purchase.

247
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Stealing onions?

248
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
How ridiculous.

249
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I want to meet you tomorrow.

250
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
We'll talk in your hometown tonight.

251
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,940
Then, decide whether you want to go over to my hometown

252
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,800
or go to a other region to seize meal.

253
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Come on.

254
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
upbeat

255
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Welcome.

256
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Hmm.

257
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
You're diabetes.

258
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
These and other neurological diseases

259
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
are the most common diseases in the world.

260
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Just go without stopping.

261
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,400
We believe that we can help her have life.

262
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,120
Come.

263
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,040
Users, please gather at the right time.

264
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,320
Call when you want.

265
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,460
It will fire your festival delicious food sometimes.

266
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,080
Stop dreaming.

267
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Go for it.

268
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Who's there?

269
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Who's there?

270
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Master, Ruyi!

271
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Ling Xiao,

272
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
why did you go back to the room

273
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
after Master came back?

274
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Did I shout too much

275
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
and offend Master

276
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
and make him angry?

277
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Ling Xiao,

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Ling Xiao,

285
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
do you know

286
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
how much

287
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I've suffered

288
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
from lack of respect

289
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,560
and

290
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,800
care?

291
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Ling Xiao,

292
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Ling Xiao,

295
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Ling Xiao,

297
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Ling Xiao,

299
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Ling Xiao,

301
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Ling Xiao,

303
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,500
Have you lived for more than eight months?

305
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,840
Yet, you still government booster.

306
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,820
Shouldn't you be flying around in this position tomorrow?

307
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,660
From now on,

308
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,360
I want to

309
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,760
help you with your main task.

310
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,400
Do you have any more problem?

311
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,900
No.

312
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,020
How can I help?

313
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,520
You'll have to apply a cursory action.

314
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,200
I don't know how you spent this Mid-Autumn Festival.

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Is there anyone by your side?

316
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm so lucky to meet you, Master.

317
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm always happy.

318
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Although I used to live alone,

319
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
I don't care about anything.

320
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
But it turns out that there's someone who can eat and drink with you.

321
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
It's still different.

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,800
He even went to steal the green onion with me.

323
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,000
I found it! Master, Mr. Ruyi!

324
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
Also, do you know...

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Duan Ning!

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Why did Master stay in the training room all morning?

327
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
He's been sitting here for the whole night.

328
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Something's wrong.

329
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
Mu Qingge,

330
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,800
did you willingly give me the golden elixir?

331
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Yes.

332
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm willing to help the real person to overcome the Heaven's calamity.

333
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,800
I just hope that the real person can see my determination to destroy the country.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
If you're really honest and kind,

335
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I will definitely make you understand.

336
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm going to the mountain.

337
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,200
After this, I will inform all the sects

338
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
to find the whereabouts of the elixir.

339
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
I won't treat you as a burden anymore.

340
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm trapped here.

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Thank you for giving me the chance.

342
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Indeed, Master taught me the elixir of healing the spirit's roots.

343
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Even though the spirit's roots have no immortal powers,

344
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
they are indeed different.

345
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
They are just a combination of five elements

346
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
to form a five-formal elixir.

347
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,100
This elixir may be able to heal my five-formal spirit's roots.

348
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Mu Qingge, you actually are in this life-saving place.

349
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
How could this happen?

350
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm sorry, Immortal.

351
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
My life-saving thunder is coming.

352
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Why is there a sudden change in spiritual power?

353
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Just a little bit more.

354
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Ran Ran, take the Shuo Gong Shou Lin Tai.

355
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
The golden azoth of the Immortal has broken.

357
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I forgot to tell you.

358
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Although I was born with five spiritual roots,

359
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
each of them had its flaws.

360
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
The Nine Flower Rock Fist also helped me to reach the Yin Jing.

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
It's just that it's a pity that the Immortal

362
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,800
was attacked by the Thunder.

363
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Master!

364
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Demoness, what are you doing?

365
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
It's because the Immortal wanted to take my golden azoth to fight against the Thunder.

366
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Who knew that it would happen to hurt yourself?

367
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
It has nothing to do with me.

368
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Don't talk nonsense.

369
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
My Master is not a demon that you can take away from people.

370
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
You dare to doubt the reputation of the Nine Flower Sect's sect leader.

371
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
But your sect leader is such a person.

372
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Mu Qingge, I think you have no intention of regretting it.

373
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Take her away!

374
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Who dares to touch her?

375
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Who broke into the Nine Flower Mountain?

376
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
The Chief of the Palace is a man.

377
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I, the Crown Prince, am here to pay my respects to the Crown Prince.

378
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I am here to pay my respects to the Crown Prince.

379
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Xiao Yue!

380
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I knew that you would come.

381
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I used his identity to suffer this pain.

382
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I did it all to wait for you.

383
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Xiao Yue,

384
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,800
is the bottle of the Five Heavenly Immortals that I buried in your courtyard still there?

385
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
It's there.

386
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I really want to take a sip now.

387
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I have been waiting for you to come back

388
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
to discuss it with me.

389
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Your Highness, this demoness is hurting my Master!

390
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
The immortal teacher is very strict.

391
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Lady Zhan is the Emperor's personal servant.

392
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
How can she be disloyal?

393
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
She and your Xuan Men have been together for 18 years.

394
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,800
She has already taken her back.

395
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Who wants to ask for the medicine and come to the Eastern Palace to test it?

396
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Father!

397
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
You are cold. Don't touch your Master.

398
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Is Master really okay?

399
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
He didn't get infected by the spiritual energy that was sucked by the world's power.

400
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
It's the Spirit Elixir that Ran Ran made.

401
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
The Soul-suppressing Elixir that the Soul-suppressing Elixir was sucked by the Soul-suppressing Elixir.

402
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
If we are talking about the power of the Soul-suppressing Elixir,

403
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
it must be my Master.

404
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
No one can remember it.

405
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
The Soul-suppressing Elixir has not been broken for a day.

406
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It's still in danger.

407
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
We must quickly make up for the spiritual energy and make it into a golden elixir.

408
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,800
This battle will be returned by Muran Wu sooner or later.

409
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
This palace has been built for you.

410
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
The palace's architecture has banned magic.

411
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
But this place is able to avoid the ban.

412
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
You can practice without any problems.

413
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Do you like it?

414
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I still like my original appearance.

415
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
But all of my past experiences are like a dream to me.

416
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,800
When I wake up, I realize that I shouldn't be like before.

417
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I want to live this life well,

418
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
in the form of a new one.

419
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Qingge, no matter what you look like,

420
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
as long as it's you, it's good.

421
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Men.

422
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes.

423
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Remove the flowers and put them away.

424
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Yes.

425
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Xiao Yu has grown up.

426
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,800
But he looks like a different person.

427
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,800
But he has learned the art of keeping his body and keeping his words.

428
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm afraid that when I grow older, I'll become ugly.

429
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
You won't be willing to see me anymore.

430
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Okay.

431
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
I'll be fine.

432
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I'll be fine.

433
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I'll be fine.

434
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll be fine.

435
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll be fine.

436
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm willing to see you.

437
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Very good. I'm very satisfied.

438
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Are you willing to stay?

439
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I won't let you suffer any more in this life.

440
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Any more pain.

441
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
You don't have to agree immediately.

442
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
You must be tired today.

443
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
When you're done resting,

444
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I still have a lot of things

445
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
to tell you.

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
You can all leave.

447
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes.

448
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Your Highness.

449
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
It's a pity.

450
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Your spiritual power,

451
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
your life,

452
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,800
and Su Yu who is obsessed with you,

453
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
are all mine.

454
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
And you,

455
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,800
are just a name.

456
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
But I won't use your face to continue this life.

457
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Slowly,

458
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Su Yu will forget about you.

459
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm by his side.

460
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
It's me.

461
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
It's only me.

462
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,800
You hate your sister.

463
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I just hope she disappears.

464
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,800
With her around, I'll never be seen.

465
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
This soul lock

466
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,800
will let you easily get everything she has.

467
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,800
In this life, the soul lock didn't affect her spiritual power.

468
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
The fruit I've cut 18 years ago,

469
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
can it still exist?

470
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Will Su Yishui really ignore me?

471
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
This life,

472
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Does it really fit you?

473
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
This waste of energy.

474
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Oh.

475
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Aren't we dusting your lowest level.

476
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,200
I will fight with Grand Master.

477
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,800
You're awake.

478
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,840
Thank you for saving me

479
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,200
when I was practicing Dan Cha.

480
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,800
I thought you were rude to me

481
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,880
and made me angry.

482
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
You didn't want to talk to me.

483
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,360
I shouldn't have mentioned that.

484
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,760
Master, you play the most gentle tune.

485
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,560
It's so nice.

486
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
How do you know it's the most gentle tune?

487
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,360
Except me,

488
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,760
only the other person knows it.

489
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
The other person is Grand Master?

490
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,160
This was made by Grand Master.

491
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,160
I read the score on the bowl.

492
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Who knows

493
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,160
this is a little secret

494
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
that only the two of us know?

495
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,560
Master,

496
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,360
I found the bowl

497
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,760
on my own.

498
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
I was attracted by the letter

499
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,960
that said I could make rice wine.

500
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
I will never

501
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,160
hide anything from Grand Master again.

502
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Although Grand Master wrote the murder weapon,

503
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,760
I don't think it's malicious.

504
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,160
I just want to record what happened

505
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,960
and know more about you.

506
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,560
You've read it?

507
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,360
I want to know more about you, Master.

508
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,560
What did the murder weapon say?

509
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,760
Tell me.

510
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,760
Actually, I didn't read it that carefully.

511
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,560
This weapon is fierce.

512
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
It can't be washed with onion and garlic.

513
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,360
It's sharp and sharp.

514
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,160
It needs to be careful when fighting.

515
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,160
If it's too arrogant,

516
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,160
it will be the most deadly weapon.

517
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,960
It needs to be fought with every move.

518
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,360
But if it's used to cure the eye of the dragon

519
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,560
that is covered with the smoke of the sea,

520
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,960
it can be cured with three-fold anger.

521
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,360
You really like to eat the dragon's eye.

522
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,760
I can try to make it.

523
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Stop reading these useless things.

524
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,760
There are some tricks

525
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,960
of the Danwan Kungfu.

526
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
You can take a look.

527
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,560
I haven't punished you

528
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,760
for ignoring the trick of spiritual power and external power.

529
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
You didn't listen to the master's order and made a mess.

530
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,960
You are so ungrateful.

531
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Tomorrow morning, go to the Lingxi Dan water in the back hill

532
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,960
and hand over all the flowers and plants in the back hill.

533
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,560
You can't miss a single one.

534
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
You should feel your impudent attitude.

535
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,760
Yes, Master.

536
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,760
I will.

537
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,160
Qingge.

538
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,760
What's going on?

539
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,760
Your Highness,

540
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
the poison that Lady Zhan

541
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,560
planted is from the Chismen's Yuen Shui.

542
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,960
Wei Jiu?

543
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Didn't she and Su Yishui set up a soul master

544
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,160
and didn't want to hurt Qingge?

545
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
Wei Jiu used the Yuen Shui

546
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
to make me plant the poison.

547
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,960
Before I became a soul master,

548
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
even if I die for nothing,

549
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,760
I can't be considered as a person.

550
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
How dare you!

551
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Your Highness, wait.

552
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,960
I've sent someone to the stone gate

553
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,360
to check the information.

554
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Here's the news.

555
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Mu Qingge,

556
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
after we parted,

557
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
I think you still remember me.

558
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
You came to the Chismen

559
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,160
to give me all your spiritual power

560
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,360
and spend the night with me.

561
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,560
I will help you to remove the Yuen Shui.

562
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
Don't wait too long.

563
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
The Yuen Shui is in the heart.

564
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
The immortals of the Great Luo

565
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,760
won't be able to save you.

566
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
You bastard!

567
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
Qingge, don't worry.

568
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,160
I'll follow the order of your son

569
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
and go to the Xuanmen Gate.

570
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,760
I don't believe that only Wei Jiu can remove the Yuen Shui.

571
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,960
You're rushing so fast.

572
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,560
Mo Ranwu can't hold on anymore.

573
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,960
Now,

574
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,760
Wei Jiu can't remove his Yuen Shui.

575
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,560
You're the only one he can ask for.

576
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
You sent Ranran to the back hill

577
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,760
because you're afraid that Mo Ranwu will come and meet her.

578
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,960
Mo Ranwu will surely

579
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,360
follow her sister's whereabouts.

580
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Although Ranran has the Black Blood Guardian,

581
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,560
she can't find anything.

582
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,560
But it's better to do it for a while.

583
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,560
That's right.

584
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
We'll set up a trap for Mo Ranwu

585
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,160
and wait for him to go up the mountain.

586
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
The owner said

587
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,360
that it's impossible for the Immortal Mu

588
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
to take back the old magic weapons and work flag.

589
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
It just takes some time to clean up the old things.

590
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Please go up the mountain and take a break.

591
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,560
Why is Mu Qingge here?

592
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Could it be that

593
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,360
he's going to take back the West Mountain Sect's position?

594
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,560
He was supposed to

595
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
take the whole West Mountain to be buried.

596
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
If it wasn't for Master Li Wanwan,

597
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
what right does he have to come to the West Mountain?

598
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,360
I don't think he wants to.

599
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,160
He was supposed to assist His Majesty to ascend the throne

600
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,960
and make great contributions.

601
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,560
Although he has committed a great crime,

602
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
he's now the most noble person

603
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
in the Imperial City Palace.

604
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm sorry to have to have to take such a big test.

605
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
I'll take my leave now.

606
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Come with me.

607
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
The mountain of snow didn't care about me.

608
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,160
Now he wants me to go up the mountain and put me up.

609
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Su Yingshui is deliberately humiliating me.

610
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,360
Maybe I'm right.

611
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,360
He's just a little bit of a coward.

612
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
I think he's just trying to make me feel better.

613
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
About eating food alone,

614
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
he should be a little girl.

615
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Because your��

616
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
I've known the existence of another fruit,

617
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,560
I've already covered it up with a double-PR yesterday.

618
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,560
Is this what your teacher usually teaches you?

619
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Why don't I come and play with you?

620
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,260
If the plant grow and the bean grows and vase grows along with me,

621
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,160
only a number of fruits can upside the blood andierto then.

622
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,040
Master didn't take the gold.

623
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,760
And when he saw the murderous film of Grand Master,

624
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,840
he seemed to be happy.

625
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,720
Master even played the most gentle tune

626
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,760
that Grand Master composed.

627
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,400
What kind of relationship

628
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,560
do Grand Master and Grand Master have?

629
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,440
I got it.

630
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Mu.

631
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,000
I didn't expect you to go back to West Mountain.

632
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,360
What's this?

633
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,840
It's a trap to catch the mountain chicken.

634
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,440
I learned it from the top of the gold.

635
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,640
I want to try making three roasted mountain chickens.

636
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,440
But I don't have the green plums for now.

637
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,880
Can I use the foreign plums instead?

638
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
What green plums and foreign plums?

639
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,560
The most annoying thing in my life

640
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,400
is this thing of three garbage.

641
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,680
Grand Master doesn't remember

642
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,040
the gold he wrote.

643
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,920
His mood is completely different.

644
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
You are Su Yishui's disciple.

645
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,360
You can't be the same as him.

646
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,640
Su Yishui's disciple?

647
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,240
Su Yishui is so annoying.

648
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Then I'll teach him a lesson.

649
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,080
No.

650
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,280
Are you going to teach me a lesson?

651
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Xiaoshui,

652
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,320
you finally come out to see me.

653
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,240
Why are you still standing here?

654
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,640
Have you finished your punishment?

655
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
I'll go to the spiritual punishment now.

656
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Xiaoshui,

657
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
I haven't been back to the West Mountain for a long time.

658
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,680
Come with me.

659
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
You came to the West Mountain

660
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,600
just to take a walk?

661
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,360
I have something to ask you to do.

662
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,280
Now the Crown Prince is the one to support me.

663
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,040
Someone else will help you with the payment.

664
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,200
Why bother to ask me, a man from the mountain?

665
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
You are not happy?

666
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,320
I have my own arrangement

667
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,800
to stay by Xiaoyu's side.

668
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,280
But in my heart,

669
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,120
how can she ask you to do that?

670
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,960
There is no one here.

671
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,680
You don't have to pretend to be cold.

672
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,360
I know you are kind to me.

673
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,160
Kind?

674
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,120
I didn't expect you to be so kind to me.

675
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,600
When my soul was broken,

676
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
only you were willing to give up everything to bring me back to life.

677
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,720
I will never become a deity

678
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,880
and I will never betray you.

679
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,160
You are poisoned by the grudge of Chimu.

680
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,560
Is that why you came here?

681
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
I know you have studied the Tao of Demonic Cultivation

682
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,560
and are good at detoxification.

683
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,160
I can help you detoxify.

684
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,680
Ranran.

685
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,280
Since you are lazy,

686
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,560
come with me to the bookshelves

687
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,560
to serve the guests with tea and incense.

688
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
Yes, Master.

689
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,040
Xiaoshui.

690
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,080
I knew you would help me.

691
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
Don't say that.

692
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,120
I will try to use my martial arts to drive out the grudge.

693
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,800
Even though Master used his silent words to save me,

694
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,080
he still大家都 wanted to sympathize with us.

695
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,400
He clearly cared about the task.

696
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,100
Get out.

697
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,520
Feel free to start.

698
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:47,440
Use Jansheng Poison

699
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,080
When I goie

700
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,080
I understand

701
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,240
group

702
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I'll win both.

703
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,880
Shoot.

704
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,880
You practiced the Spirit-Gathering Pill with Ranran's prescription?

705
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,120
Good.

706
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,400
With the Spirit-Gathering Pill's power,

707
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,520
I can charge the spiritual platform.

708
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,360
I should be able to

709
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,760
sense the absence of the spiritual power.

710
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,600
But if I want to be promoted again,

711
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,600
it'll be troublesome.

712
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,120
It's a pity

713
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,040
that I can only help you to recover a little.

714
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,480
Luckily, I've made up for the absence of the spiritual power.

715
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,080
It'll be faster to practice.

716
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,680
They're about to wake up.

717
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,280
You can go out first.

718
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,800
Su Mo.

719
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,840
Be careful of the Spirit-Gathering Pill's power.

720
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,080
Stop talking nonsense.

721
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,200
I know.

722
00:42:40,800 --> 00:43:06,840
What have I done?

723
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,440
Actually, we don't know each other.

724
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,440
What are you doing here?

725
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,040
I'm here to see you.

726
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm here to see you.

727
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I'm here to see you.

728
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm here to see you.

729
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
