00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,960
[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,890
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,970
This is for you, Master.

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,160
Look at this little angry doll.

5
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,039
Doesn't it look

6
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,039
exactly like you?

7
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,150
Next time you feel like getting mad,

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,350
just squeeze it hard.

9
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,759
Childish.

10
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,150
Who would want something like this?

11
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,280
Xue Ranran,

12
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,150
you'd better make me fall for you soon,

13
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,210
or your Golden Core will be in danger.

14
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,560
Just like the fierce beast recorded

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,760
in "The Collection of Entertainment."

16
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,230
Master, wait for me!

17
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,630
Hurry up.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,840
Guardian.

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,030
Ranran, you're back too.

20
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,520
From now on, the daily meals at Mount Wester

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,180
will be handled by Xue Ranran.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,460
That's wonderful!

23
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,560
Guardian, I knew

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
you care for Ranran the most.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Guardian,

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,280
those new disciples

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
you asked us to recruit

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,870
have completed their aptitude tests.

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,910
New disciples?

30
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,960
Master,

31
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,980
since you're willing to take on disciples now,

32
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,800
why not call back Xi'er

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,660
and the others?

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
They've been waiting at the foot of the mountain

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,290
for your instructions.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,750
They're so foolish.

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,650
What use do I have for them?

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,560
I only want disciples

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,630
with exceptional talents and Spiritual Roots.

40
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,150
Well,

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,260
with more disciples at Mount Wester,

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,960
there will surely be

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,710
more trivial matters to handle.

44
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,040
Mount Wester is so vast.

45
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,190
Mr. Yu Chen and Ms. Yu Tong

46
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,040
can't handle everything on their own.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,790
Xi'er and the others know Mount Wester well.

48
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,190
They can be of great help.

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,120
If you don't say anything,

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,250
I'll take it as a yes.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,460
Thank you, Master!

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,760
Who are you?

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,240
How dare you trespass into Celestial Sect!

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,380
So you're the immortal masters

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,280
from Eternal Sect and Hollow Sect.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,030
What brings you to Mount Scarlet

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,240
at this late hour?

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,610
Where's Wei Jiu?

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Get him out!

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,590
His Lordship is in seclusion.

61
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,120
If you have anything to say,

62
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,210
you can say it to me.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,470
Many spirits

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,030
have been turned into demons lately.

65
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,760
Is that the doing of you demons?

66
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,470
Demonification of spirits?

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
We don't have time to waste

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,649
on something so pointless.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,950
Now that Celestial Sect has been rebuilt,

70
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,150
demons have an endless source of power,

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,190
and many lost demonic techniques have resurfaced.

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,280
Why would we want

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,520
to turn spirits into demons?

74
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,030
I don't care how the so-called righteous sects

75
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,980
view us,

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
but demonic cultivators

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,600
and the Heavenly Ones

78
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,680
have just chosen

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,480
different cultivation methods.

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,940
We exist in the same world.

81
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,270
What reason do demons have

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,870
to cause chaos or destroy it?

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,480
Fine.

84
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
I'll believe you for now.

85
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,070
However, this wave of demonification

86
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,130
is no small matter.

87
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,830
You demons

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,950
have always known more

89
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,040
about demonic things.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,750
If you truly have nothing to do with

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,950
the demonification,

92
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,160
do you have any way

93
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,840
to help us investigate?

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,090
Alright.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll send word

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,040
for all our demons

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,950
to stay vigilant against the demonification.

98
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,280
If we uncover anything,

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,220
you'll be informed immediately.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,070
Then consider this a temporary alliance

101
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,240
between us.

102
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,920
Greetings, My Lord.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,580
My Lord.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,510
Elder Tu,

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
how dare you make an agreement

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
with the Heavenly Ones

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
while I was in seclusion?

108
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,600
Since when do I

109
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,430
need to answer to those Heavenly Ones?

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,560
This is outrageous!

111
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,880
My apologies.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,430
I overstepped

113
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,490
and acted on my own.

114
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm willing to accept punishment.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,780
Expel me from Celestial Sect.

116
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,360
You only need

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,030
to announce to the Heavenly Sects

118
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,270
that Celestial Sect has no one named Tu Jiuyuan,

119
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,600
and the agreement I made

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,160
will naturally be void.

121
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,680
You...

122
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,110
Everyone, leave us.

123
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,820
Yes!

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,410
Tu Jiuyuan,

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,210
what's wrong with you?

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,140
I merely scolded you a bit,

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
and you want to leave?

128
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,210
Actually…

129
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,250
Actually, it's not that serious.

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,600
I am

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,190
a magnanimous person.

132
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,000
Considering

133
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,750
your years of loyalty,

134
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,810
I'll let this slide.

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,460
You should be thanking me now.

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,510
I once promised the former sovereign

137
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,390
to assist you.

138
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,680
Now that you've rebuilt Celestial Sect

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,010
and got what you wanted,

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,910
my promise has been fulfilled.

141
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,510
I just want freedom now.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,070
I want to leave this place that has caged me for half my life

143
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,310
and live freely as I please.

144
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,450
Stop!

145
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Why hasn't

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,620
your wound healed?

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,080
It's just a minor injury.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't worry about it.

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,190
Your wound hasn't even healed.

150
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,000
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,400
You...

152
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,390
Don't tell me

153
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,430
you're leaving because you loved me

154
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,560
but couldn't have me

155
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,940
and your love has turned into hate.

156
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,220
Actually,

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,750
that day in the netherworld…

158
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
If I told her

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,030
that I went back to find her,

160
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,040
it'd be so embarrassing.

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,410
Never mind.

162
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,750
You...

163
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,090
Look at you, so badly injured.

164
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,630
After all these years,

165
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,830
you're still so weak.

166
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,220
I…

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll allow you

168
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,970
to cultivate with me

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,740
and share my spiritual power.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Happy now?

171
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,280
My Lord, you've misunderstood.

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,750
I've long let go of love,

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,120
and there's no hate to hold onto either.

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
I just want to live

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
a different life.

176
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,270
My Lord,

177
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,740
take care of yourself.

178
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
Stop!

179
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,120
Who said

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
your promise to that old man

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,450
has been fulfilled?

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,360
My true goal

183
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,850
is to bring back the golden age of demonic cultivation.

184
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,240
Rebuilding Celestial Sect

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,630
was only the beginning.

186
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,520
If you want to leave,

187
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,890
you have to help me

188
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,080
break the Five Deadly Formations

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,610
at the peak of Mount Scarlet

190
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,570
so I can

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
reach its dark side

192
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,040
and obtain the legendary Gold Refining Fire.

193
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,910
Gold Refining Fire?

194
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,080
Yes.

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,170
Demonic creatures all fear it.

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
If I can get it,

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,750
I'll be able to control

198
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,950
and command those demonified spirits,

199
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
bending them

200
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
to my will.

201
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,000
By then,

202
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
all Heavenly Sects

203
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,510
will have to kneel before me,

204
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,790
and Celestial Sect

205
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,270
will rise above them all.

206
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,960
Only then

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,030
will your promise

208
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,160
be truly fulfilled.

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,490
Then I'll let you go.

210
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,480
But

211
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,600
if you fail to break the Five Deadly Formations

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
and get the Gold Refining Fire,

213
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,560
you'll have to stay here.

214
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,080
Ranran.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,550
Ms. Yu Tong.

216
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
How are Xi'er and the others

217
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,550
settling in?

218
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,000
Earlier, they went

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,790
to pay their respects to Master.

220
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,320
But Master found it troublesome

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,670
and just responded from inside the room

222
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,070
without letting them in.

223
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,600
They're now

224
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,930
tidying up their rooms.

225
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,500
Good.

226
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,290
[Su Yishui's disciple, Shen Kuo]

227
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,290
[Su Yishui's disciple, Yue Sheng]

228
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,090
That's Xue Ranran.

229
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,390
She came first in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,320
and gained its spiritual power.

231
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,630
Today, I'll cook

232
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,670
a good meal for everyone

233
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,470
to celebrate.

234
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,270
I'll be going now.

235
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,890
Usually, by this time,

236
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,200
she has already brought me tea and snacks.

237
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,460
What's going on today?

238
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,260
Xue Ranran.

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,910
Xue Ranran!

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
Still nowhere to be seen.

241
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,840
How could there be

242
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,240
a girl who flirts like her?

243
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
One step forward, two steps back,

244
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,500
never truly making progress!

245
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,370
Hello, Ms. Xue.

246
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm a new disciple, Yue Sheng.

247
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,790
I look forward to learning from you.

248
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,170
Yue Sheng, nice to meet you.

249
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,870
I can wash the vegetables

250
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,840
for you, Ms. Xue.

251
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,960
No need for that.

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,910
It's fine. I enjoy washing vegetables.

253
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,480
Ms. Xue,

254
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,560
just leave this kind of work to him.

255
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,150
Alright.

256
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,910
Thank you.

257
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,320
Okay.

258
00:11:59,510 --> 00:11:59,970
Ms. Xue,

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,510
let me help with something else.

260
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,970
No need.

261
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,670
Ms. Xue,

262
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,370
my name is Shen Kuo.

263
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,670
From now on, I'll handle

264
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
all the chopping.

265
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,460
Thank you then.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,400
It's nothing.

267
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,200
Ms. Xue, let me help you.

268
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,410
You're quite skilled, aren't you?

269
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,890
I learned this

270
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,650
somewhere else

271
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,890
before coming here.

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
Honestly, I joined Wester Sect

273
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,470
because I admire you, Ms. Xue.

274
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,720
Ignore him, Ms. Xue.

275
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,090
The vegetables are washed.

276
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,200
I heard your alchemy skills are incredible.

277
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Could I learn from you sometime?

278
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,240
Sure.

279
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,550
I'll teach you another day.

280
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,200
It's a deal!

281
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,030
I want to learn too.

282
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,490
Ms. Xue.

283
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,430
You can't learn!

284
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:45,910
Master.

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,030
-Master.
-Master.

286
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,480
Master.

287
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,940
Master.

288
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,570
So lively here, huh?

289
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,220
Since you have so much free time

290
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,550
to chat and joke around,

291
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,840
then go to Westerly Valley

292
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,550
and hold a handstand for 20 hours!

293
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,240
Yes.

294
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Yes, Master.

295
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,440
Wait.

296
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,970
From now on, none of you are allowed

297
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,570
to go near the kitchen again.

298
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

299
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,150
Master.

300
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,000
Master.

301
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,470
I brought you lunch.

302
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Master?

303
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,840
Master.

304
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,120
After teaching your junior brothers alchemy

305
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,510
and having fun with them,

306
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,570
you finally remembered your master?

307
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,610
Master,

308
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
you're not jealous, are you?

309
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,870
Jealous?

310
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm only cooperating with you

311
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,440
to break the Soul-Cleansing Charm.

312
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,700
Why would I be jealous?

313
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,530
Then what is this about?

314
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,320
I just didn't expect

315
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,400
Mu Qingge's foolish younger sister

316
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,510
to be just like her,

317
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,360
flirting with everyone

318
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,800
and being so fickle.

319
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,390
I'm foolish?

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,270
And I, Mu Qingge, am fickle?

321
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,750
You insulted me twice

322
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
in just one sentence.

323
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,360
Yeah,

324
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,440
you're right.

325
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,630
I do like

326
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,240
handsome, debonair men.

327
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,750
However,

328
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,840
I already

329
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,030
have someone I love.

330
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,050
And I love him wholeheartedly

331
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,190
because no one is more handsome

332
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,170
or more worthy of love than him.

333
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,000
Xue Ranran,

334
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,790
don't just talk the talk.

335
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,550
With your little tricks,

336
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,790
how long will you need to pursue me?

337
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,600
When will you finally break the spell?

338
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Since you put it that way,

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,270
I guess I'll have to

340
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,810
take it a step further.

341
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,160
Do you think I'll be afraid?

342
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,460
♫After parting, the black silk-like hair turned snow-white♫

343
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,280
♫In secret, I have so much to say to you♫

344
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,100
♫Only after I met you♫

345
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,390
You just asked

346
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,320
if I was jealous.

347
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:33,230
♫Did I realize there are heaven-like places all because of you♫

348
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,360
I thought I needed to test that.

349
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,730
So what's your conclusion?

350
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,520
♫Maybe a lifetime is too short, too fleeting♫

351
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,780
♫So we were granted a second chance♫

352
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,500
♫With endless time to write our story♫

353
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,870
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

354
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,520
♫From now onwards♫

355
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,630
Wait.

356
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,360
Why are you not shy at all

357
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
after kissing me?

358
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,390
Have you kissed someone

359
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,390
like this before?

360
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah,

361
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,120
I once kissed a pig.

362
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,360
A pig indeed.

363
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,320
This is outrageous!

364
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,390
I haven't gotten mad yet,

365
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,850
and she's acting all hurt!

366
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,370
Good thing I brought her back.

367
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,880
If I had left her out there,

368
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,910
she'd end up breaking the hearts

369
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,240
of many naive young men!

370
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,950
Kissed a pig...

371
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,720
Hold on.

372
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,150
A pig?

373
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,350
Could it be...

374
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,840
Elder Tu,

375
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,270
you've tried a lot of times.

376
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,200
You need to stop.

377
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,340
Elder Tu.

378
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,390
Greetings, My Lord.

379
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,829
You underestimate the Five Deadly Formations.

380
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,430
With your weak cultivation,

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,510
you can't even break through

382
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,349
the outermost barrier,

383
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,010
let alone get in to break them.

384
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,680
Stop wasting your energy.

385
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,310
Go back.

386
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,589
I can't break them now,

387
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
but since I made a promise to you,

388
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,790
I'll find a way to break them.

389
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,400
When I do,

390
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
I hope you can keep your word.

391
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,500
Fortunately, Tu Jiuyuan

392
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,030
can't get past the barrier.

393
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,710
If she actually managed to enter the formations,

394
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,570
it would be extremely dangerous.

395
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,920
I've tried so many times

396
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,880
but still can't break the formations inside.

397
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I really need to think of

398
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,920
another way.

399
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,590
He kissed me first,

400
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,600
yet he's making me copy the disciples' rules.

401
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,160
He's just being stubborn.

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,790
Again?

403
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,350
The cultivation method Uncle Ye Xin taught me

404
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,950
is already showing results.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Let me see

406
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,550
if I can use this formation

407
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,110
to activate the Soul-Devouring Lock again

408
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,960
and take back Xue Ranran's

409
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
spiritual power.

410
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,720
Drawing power from me when I have none left?

411
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,780
This could kill me!

412
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,830
I need stronger people!

413
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,610
Yes.

414
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,550
Fortunately, I took the Spirit-Nourishing Pill in advance.

415
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,030
Ranran.

416
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,400
What's wrong?

417
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,570
Why do you look so pale?

418
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Did Guardian…

419
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,850
That's from Master?

420
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,670
He ordered these dishes?

421
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,560
He said

422
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,710
you have to make and bring them to him yourself

423
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,750
to show you really regret your mistake.

424
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,010
Being stubborn again.

425
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,440
If he wants to see me,

426
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,300
why can't he come himself?

427
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,140
Ms. Yu Tong,

428
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,350
please tell him

429
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,840
my hands are sore

430
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,480
from copying the rules and I can't cook.

431
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,070
He'll have to make do with what's available.

432
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,880
As for me,

433
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,750
I regret nothing,

434
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,660
so I won't go and annoy him.

435
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Exactly. Don't always indulge him.

436
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, Ms. Yu Tong,

437
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,030
there's something

438
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,310
I'd like Mr. Yu Chen

439
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,970
to investigate in the capital for me.

440
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,960
Guardian has already sent

441
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,220
Yu Chen to the capital.

442
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't know

443
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,200
if it's for the same thing

444
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
you want to look into.

445
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,440
Master is also looking for Ye Xin.

446
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,200
Since that's the case,

447
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,920
if Mr. Yu Chen finds anything,

448
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,620
please let me know as well.

449
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
She said that?

450
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,240
Ranran looked very pale.

451
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,810
She didn't even eat dinner.

452
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,070
She rushed back with you

453
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,470
without proper rest.

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,610
Before that,

455
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,280
she had been physically and mentally drained.

456
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
No matter how good others are,

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,460
they can't compare to you.

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,270
You're elegant and otherworldly,

459
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,240
like fine jade.

460
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
Just like these Ice Lotuses.

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,350
They may seem cold at first glance,

462
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,400
but upon closer inspection,

463
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
they're refreshing to the heart and mind.

464
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,340
They actually make one feel warm.

465
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,680
Master,

466
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,070
it's you.

467
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,830
Who else did you think it would be?

468
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,760
This spirit pool

469
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,590
is on my way

470
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,320
from the study to my residence.

471
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,960
Are you perhaps

472
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,490
deliberately staying here

473
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,030
to awake my memories?

474
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,930
Your flirting tricks

475
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,270
seem a bit dull.

476
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,400
What are you expecting?

477
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
I just missed you.

478
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,380
Besides, have you forgotten?

479
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,070
Back then,

480
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,750
you taught me cultivation techniques here

481
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,880
in this spirit pool.

482
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,680
I was just using

483
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,540
the technique you taught me to replenish my energy.

484
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,230
Why is your pulse so unstable?

485
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,410
Did your energy go off track during cultivation?

486
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,690
You've been suffering

487
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,480
from the Soul-Devouring Lock all this time.

488
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,740
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,280
Are you worried about me?

490
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm just

491
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,550
worried about my Golden Core

492
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,280
and want to regain my memories as soon as possible.

493
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,640
Since your usual flirting tricks

494
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,720
aren't working,

495
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,270
perhaps you could try

496
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,330
going a bit deeper.

497
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,510
How

498
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
do I do that?

499
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,640
I mean,

500
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,680
you could try being a little more affectionate

501
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,750
or lean on me more.

502
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,080
What were you thinking?

503
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,290
You used to do the same,

504
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,850
telling me to ask you for help more.

505
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,960
Immortal Master Xue,

506
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,690
you're here.

507
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,780
I've prepared breakfast for you.

508
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,680
Here.

509
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,170
Why is there

510
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
a special serving for me?

511
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
Guardian ordered it.

512
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,220
He said he'll be in seclusion

513
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,420
for the next few days,

514
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,590
so you don't need to prepare meals for him.

515
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,420
Seclusion?

516
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,500
But he...

517
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
It's not true.

518
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,350
That's just an excuse.

519
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,790
Guardian may not say it outright,

520
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,590
but I can tell

521
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,480
he's just worried you'll overwork yourself.

522
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,400
He even placed a barrier

523
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,430
around the spirit pool.

524
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,290
Except for you,

525
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,640
no one can approach it.

526
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,960
He wants you to go there

527
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
every day at noon to replenish your energy.

528
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,240
Junior Brother,

529
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,950
mind moving over a bit

530
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,570
so we can sit and eat?

531
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,570
There's no space left.

532
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,750
Why squeeze in?

533
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,980
Go eat somewhere else.

534
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,200
Junior Brother,

535
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,330
this table

536
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,160
was ours to begin with.

537
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,350
Is your name

538
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,920
carved on the table?

539
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,750
Did any of you see a name here?

540
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,640
Nope.

541
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,590
Nope.

542
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,830
Me neither.

543
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,440
However, Senior Sister,

544
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,840
if you want to squeeze in,

545
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
we wouldn't mind.

546
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,680
Forget it. Ignore him!

547
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,830
How dare you hit me?

548
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,160
Show some respect.

549
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,510
-Let go of me!
-Let go!

550
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,070
Let go!

551
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,480
Let go of me.

552
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,450
Break the spell, you little brat.

553
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,590
Who are you calling a brat?

554
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,480
In Mount Wester,

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,110
you're not qualified to call anyone a brat.

556
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,550
You...

557
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,830
Wester Sect's rules have never allowed

558
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,590
junior disciples

559
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,830
to bully their seniors

560
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,890
just because they're more powerful.

561
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,880
A bit of pushing and shoving is one thing,

562
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,830
but using spiritual power to attack someone is another.

563
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,690
Did you intend to kill Senior Bai?

564
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,480
If you continue like this,

565
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,810
when you grow stronger,

566
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,420
won't you end up disrespecting your master?

567
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,930
If I've done wrong,

568
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,240
Master will discipline me.

569
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,640
Who are you to lecture me?

570
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,670
Break the spell!

571
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,110
I'm just someone stronger than you.

572
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,010
You got that line from her, didn't you?

573
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,960
What?

574
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,210
Not convinced?

575
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,490
But it's true that I'm stronger than you.

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
Master.

577
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,010
Master.

578
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,900
What line?

579
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,170
What do you mean?

580
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,920
You made a racket in the dining room.

581
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,250
No one is allowed to eat.

582
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,000
Carry 100 loads of water up the mountain before you can rest.

583
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,440
Yes, Master.

584
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,750
Wait.

585
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,270
Did you guys

586
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,310
not hear what I just said?

587
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,590
Master, you're punishing everyone

588
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,070
without even asking what happened.

589
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,570
Neither did my seniors.

591
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,270
Why should we be punished?

592
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,510
You did nothing wrong?

593
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,770
Then whose fault is it?

594
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,000
Discord among disciples,

595
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,240
disrespect toward seniors,

596
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,480
and fighting within the sect.

597
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,400
Clearly, it's your fault as our master.

598
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,260
Say that again!

599
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,440
Master, fate led you to take them

600
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,960
as your disciples back then.

601
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,030
You once taught them with dedication,

602
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,200
tailoring your guidance to their talents.

603
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,790
Even if you've forgotten the past,

604
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,520
they are still your disciples.

605
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,160
Did I not let them

606
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,360
stay in Mount Wester?

607
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,100
Xue Ranran,

608
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,110
don't think

609
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,830
just because I allow you

610
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,780
to help me recover my memories,

611
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,510
you can be disrespectful to me.

612
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,360
You see it as a mere task,

613
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,480
but I'm speaking from the heart.

614
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
You treat them as strangers,

615
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,590
but they're the very disciples

616
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,120
you once personally chose.

617
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,940
Your disregard for them

618
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,320
allowed the new disciples

619
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,300
to treat them

620
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,850
with such disrespect.

621
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,000
You forgot how they once

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,210
respected you

623
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,400
and remained loyal to the sect.

624
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,030
You forgot

625
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,680
how they risked their lives with you,

626
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,030
fighting demons without ever backing down.

627
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,650
Even when

628
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,660
the Heavenly Ones turned against you,

629
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,260
they never walked out on you.

630
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,250
Those things you've forgotten

631
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,180
truly happened.

632
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,720
This bond we shared

633
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
cannot be erased!

634
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,920
It was me

635
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,640
who made a fuss

636
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,760
and talked back to you today.

637
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,870
I'll take the punishment alone.

638
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,830
I'll carry

639
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,100
all 400 loads of water myself.

640
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,420
Oh, no.

641
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,400
I didn't bring the Spirit-Nourishing Pill.

642
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,460
-Ranran!
-Ranran!

643
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,760
The Soul-Devouring Lock.

644
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,440
Master.

645
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,160
Last time, you used a spirit talisman

646
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,360
to draw power from me.

647
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,480
But what happened this time?

648
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,610
Even if you have my Golden Core,

649
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,070
without me activating my power,

650
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,830
there's no way you can continuously

651
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,920
draw power from me.

652
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,950
It worked.

653
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,950
I can draw power from you now.

654
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,080
In that case,

655
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,400
from now on, wherever we go,

656
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,830
you need to stay close to me.

657
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,090
You can use my power whenever you need it.

658
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,390
In the past,

659
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,400
you often transferred spiritual power to me

660
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,510
when I was exhausted from cultivation

661
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,160
and when I was injured.

662
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,830
Later, you

663
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,510
directly connected your spiritual power with mine,

664
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,840
allowing me to draw your power at any time.

665
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,570
I wasn't drawing from you by force.

666
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
It's just a habit.

667
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,140
I must have lost my mind

668
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,830
to willingly offer you the spiritual power I got

669
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,830
through painstaking cultivation.

670
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,440
No wonder after 18 years of seclusion,

671
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,280
I barely made any progress.

672
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,720
What kind of spell

673
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,650
did you put on me?

674
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,980
Master, you taught me everything I know.

675
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,140
If I had put a spell on you,

676
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,400
you'd have noticed it.

677
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,350
You truly

678
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,610
loved and cared for me.

679
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,070
You were genuinely nice to me.

680
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,590
Sorry, Master.

681
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,590
I shouldn't have talked back to you in front of everyone.

682
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,650
I should have spoken to you properly.

683
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
In fact, you haven't changed at all.

684
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,000
You're still soft-hearted.

685
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,250
You'd still help me out

686
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
when I was in danger.

687
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,890
How surprising.

688
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,050
You actually apologized.

689
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,110
You do know

690
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,590
how to be seductive.

691
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,120
The Soul-Devouring Lock is a real pain.

692
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,160
Before I figure out a way

693
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,690
to get rid of it completely,

694
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,730
come here every day at dusk.

695
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,490
I'll help you replenish your energy.

696
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,960
As for your punishment today...

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,130
I'll go carry the water right away.

698
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,430
Forget it.

699
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,070
If you exhaust yourself,

700
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,590
it'll be my power that's wasted.

701
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,960
That's no different from punishing myself.

702
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,000
Instead of wasting time on that,

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,790
you might as well spend some time reading ancient books

704
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,890
and find out

705
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,550
what Dun Tian intended to do

706
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,410
with that heaven-defying spell.

707
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,550
You're not punishing me anymore?

708
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,570
You're right.

709
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,550
Thank you for your concern and kindness.

710
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,230
You're the best, Master.

711
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,090
[Auspicious and peaceful]

712
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,350
Master is not good with words,

713
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,680
but he's kind-hearted.

714
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,200
He often gives pills to the people at the foot of the mountain.

715
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,830
Me?

716
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,480
Kind-hearted?

717
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,880
Master excels at everything,

718
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,030
except cooking.

719
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,790
But the mooncakes he baked for me

720
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,790
were the best.

721
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,790
I baked mooncakes for her? Shouldn't it have been

722
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,990
the other way around?

723
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,900
When Master gets shy,

724
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,150
he turns his face away and ignores me.

725
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,550
If I tease him with jokes,

726
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,810
he won't look amused,

727
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
but his eyes turn warmer than usual.

728
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,350
Nonsense.

729
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,510
Salted dried longans

730
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
still aren't to Master's liking,

731
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
but he doesn't dislike them either.

732
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,270
He once said,

733
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,790
"The past is the past.

734
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,000
It's nothing

735
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
more than memories."

736
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,310
He also said,

737
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,850
"Demonic magic is neither good nor evil.

738
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
A technique is just a technique.

739
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,110
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

740
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,710
is determined by the heart."

741
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,110
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

742
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,800
is determined by the heart.

743
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Whether one is a demon or an immortal

744
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,170
is determined by the heart.

745
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,640
Those things you've forgotten

746
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,170
truly happened.

747
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,270
In fact, you haven't changed at all.

748
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
The lost memories

749
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,790
might return soon.

750
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,230
Master.

751
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,510
I punished you all yesterday,

752
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,239
and you all think it was unfair.

753
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,880
Then today, you'll each pick someone

754
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,810
to compete with.

755
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,960
I'll test your entry-level skill—

756
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,159
the Lightness Skill.

757
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,440
You need to stand on the grass

758
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,190
without using spiritual power.

759
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,989
Whoever loses

760
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,920
will have to copy the sect rules 100 times.

761
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,650
That's easy.

762
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,170
Master is clearly on our side.

763
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,440
Yue Sheng, you go.

764
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,840
Defeat them completely.

765
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,280
This is the Flame Lava

766
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,800
from Westerly Valley.

767
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,070
With your current abilities,

768
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,880
if you fall in, your body will instantly melt.

769
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,810
But don't worry.

770
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,840
Before your skin is all burned,

771
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,880
I'll fish you out.

772
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,120
You won't die.

773
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,490
Do you still have the guts to try?

774
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,020
I'm willing to try, Master.

775
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,490
I admit defeat.

776
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,540
I'm willing to accept punishment.

777
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,920
-Senior Gao!
-Gao Cang!

778
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,760
He's fine.

779
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,360
Why…

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,190
Why isn't the lava hot?

781
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,960
It's not sticking to me either.

782
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,670
I felt a familiar chill

783
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
just now.

784
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,000
Obviously, Master mixed

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,010
the extreme yin water from the spirit pool

786
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,670
with the lava in the cauldron.

787
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,760
The two neutralized each other, so it's not hot.

788
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,560
And you won't get any of it on you.

789
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,720
I knew Master wouldn't

790
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,990
be so cruel.

791
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,030
But Gao Cang didn't know.

792
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,200
He just followed Master's order

793
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,400
loyally.

794
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,550
Master,

795
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,400
you're testing

796
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,200
if what I said yesterday is true.

797
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,410
Some of you

798
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,550
have always doubted

799
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,190
whether Gao Cang

800
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,920
is worthy of being your senior.

801
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,470
He's so loyal to me.

802
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,760
That alone

803
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,340
surpasses any level of cultivation.

804
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,910
And there's your eldest senior brother,

805
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,640
Bai Baishan.

806
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,330
Tell us, why do you never

807
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
use your left hand,

808
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,290
even though it clearly works?

809
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,560
It's by Master's order.

810
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,360
You gave me a chance

811
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,350
to repent

812
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,120
and return to Mount Wester.

813
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I must strictly follow your command

814
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,250
and never disobey you.

815
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,770
Compared to them,

816
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,360
you all still have a long way to go.

817
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,030
Master has even

818
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,580
looked into these matters.

819
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,760
He's willing

820
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,280
to try believing what I said after all.

821
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,200
Master,

822
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,620
I found a few ancient books

823
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,440
about heaven-defying techniques.

824
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,920

your favorite osmanthus cakes.

826
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,670
Master was reading "The Collection of Entertainment."

827
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,670
I wonder if he was mad

828
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,200
when he saw he was described

829
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
as a fierce beast.

00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,240
are all the children of influential court officials

833

These days,

you've been reassembling your old allies

You're trying to finish what you couldn't

and wage war for the throne again?

845
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,090
So what if I am?

846

Have you considered the consequences?

847
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,320
Of course, I seek what I desire.

don't think

you can meddle in this.

851

We've been to the border towns

852

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,960
after a war.

854
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,670

865
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,440
Are you sure such a rushed uprising

866
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
can guarantee victory?

867
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,920
It'll only lead to endless wars

868
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
and a country torn apart.

869
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,800
Do you think I care about any of that?

870
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,480
You don't get to tell me what to do!

871
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,230
But Master, you once

872
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,120
risked your life for the peace of the world.

873
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,110
How could you not care?

874
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,570
Enough.

875
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
You think I'd believe I did those absurd things

876
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
just because you said so?

877
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,670
I, Su Yishui,

878
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,280
have only ever pursued absolute power over this universe.

879
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,440
But the truth is,

880
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,510
all these years,

881
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,300
you haven't tried to seize the throne.

882
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,280
You just sealed the Spirit Spring

883
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,410
in the netherworld.

884
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,880
I don't want you to let your youthful impulse

885
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,670
cloud your judgment and make a decision

886
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,550
you'll regret

887
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,260
because you forgot the path you once walked.

888
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,710
Guardian.

889
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,270
Guardian, bad news.

890
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,880
Ranran…

891
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,890
She's surrounded at the foot of the mountain.

892
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,330
What a troublemaker.

893
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,630
I want one too! I want one too!

894
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,290
There's enough for everyone.

895
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,330
I want Sovereign Su!

896
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,490
I want Sovereign Su!

897
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,680
I want Sovereign Su!

898
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,460
There's enough for everyone.

899
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,240
Alright.

900
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,630
Thank you, miss.

901
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,210
You're welcome.

902
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,930
Let's go and play!

903
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,800
Master.

904
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,710
You bribed Yu Tong

905
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,510
to trick me down the mountain

906
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,110
just to watch this nonsense?

907
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,440
Master, don't be angry.

908
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
It's all my fault.

909
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,980
It's just that today

910
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,360
is the Festival of Reverence

911
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,090
in the towns near Mount Wester.

912
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,840
So I wanted you

913
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,800
to see it.

914
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,990
What does that have to do with me?

915
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,060
Because this festival

916
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,970
is held in your honor, Master.

917
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Me?

918
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,310
19 years ago,

919
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,050
war reached Mount Wester,

920
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,920
bringing plague and spirits.

921
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,670
Before entering seclusion,

922
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,800
you treated the sick

923
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,340
and saved the people here.

924
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,650
Out of gratitude and respect,

925
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,280
they started

926
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,210
the annual Festival of Reverence.

927
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,640
Master, look.

928
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
To them,

929
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,710
the immortals up above are distant and untouchable.

930
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,760
The person in the mountain

931
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,320
who sees them through hardships

932
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,510
and keeps them safe

933
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,060
is the one they truly revere.

934
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,000
Immortal Master Su,

935
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Miss Ranran.

936
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,730
Since you're here,

937
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,590
come in

938
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,670
for some wontons.

939
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,600
Alright, Mr. Xu.

940
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,230
Thank you.

941
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,240
Let's go.

942
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,300
Come.

943
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,930
Here, same as always.

944
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,330
The condiments are here.

945
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,550
Here, Mr. Xu.

946
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,680
You're always so polite.

947
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,970
Immortal Master Su saved my life.

948
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,370
How could I charge him?

949
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,300
Back then, Mr. Xu suffered greatly from the plague.

950
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,450
You saved him,

951
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,150
giving him a second chance at life.

952
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,500
That's why he's so grateful.

953
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,740
When Westers eat here,

954
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,540
he never charges them anything.

955
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,600
Is it delicious?

956
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,670
Master, you once promised

957
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,000
to travel and try everything delicious with me.

958
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,200
But if war breaks out,

959
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,720
none of this will exist anymore.

960
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,480
Immortal Master Su,

961
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,410
Grandmother asked me to thank you.

962
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,710
Thank you.
