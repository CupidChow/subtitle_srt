351
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,600
It's just like a huge stove.

352
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,190
Did you offend Master?

353
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,690
Why is he so strict

354
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,450
with you?

355
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
I really want to eat meat buns,

356
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,670
roasted duck legs—

357
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,200
Should a cultivator be dreaming of feasting?

358
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,290
As they say,

359
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,180
cultivate your energy to live long

360
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,440
and relinquish food to become immortal.

361
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,060
If you can't even abstain from food,

362
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,460
why are you cultivating?

363
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,080
Do you think I want to?

364
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,450
I...

365
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,920
Forget it.

366
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,280
My feud with Master

367
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,340
is my own business.

368
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,480
I can't drag them all into this.

369
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,690

370
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,180
What are you afraid of?

371
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,130
What?

372
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,740
I can smell human emotions.

373
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,230
You always have this smell of cold wind

374
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,130
with gunpowder

375
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,140
about to ignite.

376
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,570
It's the feeling of nervousness and fear.

377
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,550
I just think

378
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,900
Wester Sect

379
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,250
is really a bit eerie.

380
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,450

381
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,760
even killed his master.

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,820
Aren't you scared?

383
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,100
How dare you talk about Master behind his back?

384
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,900
That demoness

385
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,570
was captivated by Master's looks

386
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,040
and held him hostage on the mountain.

387
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
Master suffered from

388
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
her torture.

389
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,520
He hates Mu Qingge.

390
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,940
Shouldn’t she be killed?

391
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,710
Master used to be pretty?

392
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,520
Don't you think you're focusing

393
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,790
on the wrong point?

394
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,210
The point is

395
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,260
Master was cursed by the demoness

396
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,770
because he tried to rid the world of evil.

397
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,370
That's how

398
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
he was disfigured.

399
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,210
If he can kill his master

400
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,690
for his cultivation,

401
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
what else can't he do?

402
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,880
You're wrong.

-Ms. Yu Tong.

404

Your master

405
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,920
is a little aloof,

406
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,500
but he's a great person.

407
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,050
This is the tonic from Guardian.

408
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,010
Guardian may be a harsh mentor,

409
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
but in a few days,

410
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,710

It seems Wei Jiu's still on our case.

413
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,260
He hasn't stopped his search.

414
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,250
I heard the blood of some Black Dragon

415
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,980
can conceal spiritual energy.

416
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,310

where that Black Dragon is.

Yes.

419
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,990
I also heard that

420
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,800
you sent that demoness

421
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,720
to get refined in Westerly Valley.

422
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,780
Does she deserve to use

423
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,300
such a

424
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,900
precious refining ground?

425
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,240
Her heart damage is beyond

426
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
my expectations.

427
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,530
After reversing our master-disciple pact,

428
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,190
I can transfer my power to her,

429
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,230
but it's just a drop in the bucket.

430
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,840
You're right.

431
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,460
The sooner she repairs her heart,

432
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,570
the sooner she can lift

434

435

That's why

436
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,300
you accepted her as a disciple.

437

There is no ready-made wine in Mount Wester.

Mu Qingge hasn’t been reborn.

524
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,650
She has nothing to do with the abnormality.

525
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,060
You set the barrier

526
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,940
and opened this Water Mirror.

527
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,440
How can you prove it's true?

528
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,170
Yan Liangyu.

529
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,760
Stop talking.

530
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,820
Don't be so anxious to protect him.

531
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,060
The abnormality

532
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,890
concerns the safety of the universe.

533
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,440
Today,

534
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,280
either give me

535
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,720
a more persuasive answer

536
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
or open the barrier at Mount Absolute

537
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,240
for us to inspect on the spot.

538
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,250
Don't patronize me with all these.

539
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,510
If you don't believe me, why are you here?

540
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,800
Go guard Mount Absolute yourself.

541
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,400
You...

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
Come eavesdrop with me.

545
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,770
Do you know

546
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,840
Elder Wen of Hollow Sect

547
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,030
came to visit?

548
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,830
Eighteen years ago,

549
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,060
Master and her were the perfect couple.

550
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,090
But our founder got in the way

551
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,450
and broke them up.

552
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,520
Founder Mu even ruthlessly

553
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,890
disfigured Elder Wen.

554
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,860
How exciting!

556
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm not interested.

557
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,400
What matters is

558
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,460
the wine I brewed will be ready today.

559
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,040
It's forbidden to

560
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,290
go behind this forest in Mount Wester.

561
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,800
No one is allowed to enter.

562
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,170
Isn’t it where

563
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,520
the demoness Mu Qingge's Consonance Palace is?

564
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,250
After she died,

565
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,990
the Palace sealed itself up with a barrier.

566
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,800
Since you're guests at Mount Wester,

567
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,400
you should follow our rules!

568
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,330
Rules?

569
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,200
It varies from person to person.

570
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,370
Your power weakens as you get

571
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,570
closer to the Palace.

572
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,400
That's why it is out of bounds.

573
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,920
If you losers are going to

574
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,270
be cowards, move aside!

575
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,200
What did you say?

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,250
Losers?

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,460
Why don't we

578
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,860
find out?

579
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,620
Admit it now?

580
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,680
Stop!

581
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,040
They're not as skilled

582
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,170
and have lost to you.

583
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,930
Do you have to be so aggressive?

584

Little girl.

You want to shield them?

586
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,970
Fine.

587
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,180

Su Yishui.

593
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,440
Should a sovereign

594
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,390
be so spiteful to the juniors?

595
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,890
I've made it clear 18 years ago that

If anything happens to you,

there might not even be a next time!

I'll do the same next time.

613

I'm weak,

until you've recited mantras for four hours.

697
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,090
What a pity.

698
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,980
This master and disciple are really inextricably entangled.

699
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
Their hatred lives on beyond death.

700
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,710
Xue Ranran.

701
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,090
Why are you focusing on such

702
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,890
nonsense now?

703
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
I must escape

704
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,130
once I get the Blood Chalcedony.

705
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,990
Xue Ranran.

706
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
What are you doing in my room?

707
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,870
I was wrong.

708
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,130
I shouldn't have barged into your room.

709
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,650
I...

710
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,000
just wanted to get back this pouch.

711
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,810
You know Su Yu?

712
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,820
How do you know him?

713
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,450
He knows Young Master Yu?

714
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,130
I just

715
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,290
met him by chance.

716
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,640
A chance encounter,

717
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,700
yet you value his pouch so much?

718
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,160
If he doesn't believe my explanation

719
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,830
and finds out that I'm here for the Blood Chalcedony,

720
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,760
I won't get a second chance at this.

721
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,370
It's...

722
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,210
just my wishful thinking,

723
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,780
but I am

724
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,400
in love with him.

725
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,920
In love?

726
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,760
So I

727
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,420
really missed this pouch.

728
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,360
Master.

729
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,190
Master?

730
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,810
What did you do to me?

731
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,190
Master's such a lightweight

732
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,090
that he got drunk from soaking in the wine?

733
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,550
The Load-Reduction Talisman is amazing.

734
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,270
Master, you're usually so boring.

735
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,660
Now that you're drunk,

736
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
why don't you sing and dance freely?

737
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,090
Indulge in drunkenness

738
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,060
and live like there's no tomorrow.

739
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,670
Thanks.

740
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,840
Qingge...

741
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,530
Why does the barrier change at night?

742
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:49,960
I...

743
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,290
I can't find the way down the mountain.

744
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,850
Luckily, I brought the jade tablet.

745
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,050
Tablet, show me the way!

746
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,720
Show me the way!

747
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,790
Little kitty.

748
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,210
I'm running out of time.

749
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,610
When that evil man wakes up,

750
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,870
he'll catch up with me!

751
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,200
Little kitty.

752
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,710
Do you know the way down the mountain?

753
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,330
If you take me out of here,

754
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,790
I'll give you all my jerky.

755
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,440
[Consonance Palace, Mount Wester]

756
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,940
[Consonance Palace]

757
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,290
The demoness' Consonance Palace?

758
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,210
Go down the mountain from here?

759
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,270
Wine recipes!

760
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Food recipes!

761
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,140
Magic spells.

762
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,290
What a variety.

763
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,310
She really was devoted to the study of pleasure.

764
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,330
It's plausible

765
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,910
that someone like her

766
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,340
abducted a handsome man.

767
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,610
But being the ruler of the universe?

768
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,540
I don't think so.

769
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,010
The map of Mount Wester!

770
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,780
Face-and-Heart Burning Curse?

771
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,900
There are only two solutions.

772
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,610
Those who're cursed must either plead the caster

773
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,540
for forgiveness

774
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,240
or attain ascension.

775
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,370
So,

776
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:08,920
that evil man

777
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,480
wants my Formless Spirit Root

778
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,610
to attain ascension

779
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,370
to remove

780
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,530
his Burning Curse.

781
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,890
No wonder he took me up the mountain.

782
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,950
I have to leave now.

783
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,920
Qingge.
