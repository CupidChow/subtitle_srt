1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,920
Lock掉

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,860
Magic

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel around the world

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to experience the beauty of the world.

6
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my dream will I understand the value of it.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I will give you a thousand years of my life.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am destined to be with you.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
But I still have no fear or regret.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I will wait until the fallen flowers wither and the people become one.

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I am slowly getting along with you.

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Episode 11

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Here, drink some more.

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Ruan Ruan, the talisman you passed on is the Nine-Tonged Ancient Formation.

16
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
This is the formation that killed Mu Yatou in the Xuan Gate.

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Who would use this formation to harm you?

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
The formation is mysterious and complex.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Except for the four sect leaders who started this formation back then,

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
no one was able to control it.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
The way each person wrote the talisman is different.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
If you still have a deep memory of the talisman in the formation,

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
you can use it to write the talisman to describe the person behind it.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
There is a legend in the folk world that

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
the person who was born in the four seas and was born in the heaven

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
was killed by the ghost of the incarnation after his soul was destroyed.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
It is said that the ghost of the incarnation was ordered to kill people without any reason.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
It's not true.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Then who was the one who set up the Nine-Tonged Ancient Formation?

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
It's this.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
This is the form that killed Mu Yatou.

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
This is the form that killed Mu Yatou.

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Mu Ranwu.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
He joined hands with the Xuan Gate back then

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
and set up the Nine-Tonged Ancient Formation to deal with Mu Qingge.

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Of course he knew about it.

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
If Mu Qingge is not Mu Qingge,

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
he could be...

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Someone broke into the Linxi Palace.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Mu Ranwu.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
That's right.

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
The same way of drawing talismans.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I was right.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The one who used half of his life to revive is not the teacher.

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I misjudged him.

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Teacher, I have something to tell you.

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
The identity of the teacher is very important.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Teacher.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Mu Yan,

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
don't worry about it.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I will go and find her.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Okay.

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Why are you here, Mr. Mu?

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Of course I'm here to accompany your teacher.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Su Yishui always has a bad mouth.

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Mr. Mu was a simple and vulgar person.

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
But he is wandering between Mr. Yu and my teacher.

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
It's really surprising.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Xiao Yu and Xiao Shui

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
all want me to accompany them more.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
They don't care.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
It's your turn to say three to four.

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
If Mr. Mu is willing to stay in the West Mountain,

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Teacher will be very happy.

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You don't have to keep the dragon-eye liver you made for him.

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,800
And you don't have to play your favorite moon night every day.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
But no one listens to it.

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
It's good that you know.

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Your teacher's heart is not for others.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,800
So you don't even know what your favorite song is?

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
You are testing me.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
When did you find out?

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
How did you see it?

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
You are lying to your teacher.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
How dare you admit it in front of your teacher?

77
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
It doesn't matter who I am.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,800
What matters is who I am in Su Yishui's heart.

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
You can tell Su Yishui.

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
You guess what she will do.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't you know how biased your teacher is?

82
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
She is so guilty about Mu Qingge's death.

83
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
She hates herself.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
She spent her life to bring back a life.

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
How precious it is.

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,800
She only believes that Mu Qingge is back.

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
My teacher won't be so guilty.

88
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Really?

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
You think your teacher is not as good as you?

90
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
You think she is not guilty?

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,800
But she doesn't want to believe it.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Some people live for a lifetime.

93
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
You can't lie to yourself.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Zi Mo is my friend.

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I hope she can be my teacher.

96
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Give it back to me.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
What?

98
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Your teacher?

99
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
What right do you have?

100
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
You...

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Xue Ranran.

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Master, you are deceived.

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
She is not Mu Qingge.

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Nonsense.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Get out.

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
She is so biased.

107
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
She is not like you.

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
She doesn't even know her favorite song.

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
You still believe her?

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Why not?

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I have been with her for 18 years.

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
No one knows her better than me.

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Enough.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Get out.

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
How dare you steal my stuff?

116
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I am helping you, Su Yushui.

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
You are so cruel.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
You just used me to get rid of Xue Ranran.

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
But you didn't apologize to me?

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,800
It seems you have decided to stay away from her.

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
You are so cruel.

122
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Aren't you afraid?

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I know what you are up to.

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
You tried to get rid of her.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
You just want her to leave the West Mountain.

126
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
It's beneficial for you.

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
But I warn you.

128
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Even though she leaves the West Mountain,

129
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
no one can hurt her.

130
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Especially you.

131
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
You are the one who will die.

132
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
This is the antidote for the God of Hell.

133
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
After you take the medicine,

134
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
get out of my West Mountain.

135
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Su Yushui.

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
It's over.

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
It's the bloodline.

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
She is so strong.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
It's hard to fight back.

140
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
She can't beat them.

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Ranran.

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Master, look.

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Su Yushui.

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
You are so mean.

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
You keep teasing me.

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You should punish her.

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Master saw it.

148
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
The way she used the woman

149
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
and the nine-bone drum she trapped us with.

150
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
She is not Mu Qingge.

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
She is Muran Wu.

152
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Master.

153
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
I know it's hard to accept.

154
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
But look at Muran Wu's

155
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
painting technique.

156
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You all know it.

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Enough.

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I don't need to prove it.

159
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Master, you still want to deceive yourself?

160
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
You still don't want to go?

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Why?

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Why master doesn't listen to me?

163
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Even Yu Gongzi knows

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Mu Qingge is wrong.

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Why master can't see it?

166
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I know Mu Qingge.

167
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Not Su Yu.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Master is confused.

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
She is not only pretending to be Mu Qingge.

170
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
She also has the nine-bone drum.

171
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
She almost killed us.

172
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
She was unconscious for days.

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Master still wants to protect her?

174
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I don't believe it.

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't believe it.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Master is not like this.

177
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
He doesn't care about others' lives.

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You know who I am.

179
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I only care about myself.

180
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't care about others' lives.

181
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
No.

182
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Master is clearly...

183
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Do you think you know me well?

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
You don't know what Mu Qingge means to me.

185
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
You shouldn't...

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I shouldn't expose the truth.

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Master would rather live in lies

188
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
than be trapped in false hope.

189
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
So what?

190
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Who do you think you are?

191
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
You are trying to frame me?

192
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Xue Ranran.

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
You are my disciple.

194
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You should respect me

195
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
and follow my path.

196
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
If you don't accept it,

197
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
you should tell me what happened.

198
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Otherwise, you will leave the West Mountain.

199
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
You can go to the capital

200
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
and find your home.

201
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It's just a dream.

202
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Master is so ungrateful.

203
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Then the West Mountain

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
is not worth a cent.

205
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
The golden pill is not ready.

206
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
You can't even get through

207
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
the small town in the West Mountain.

208
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
You are not qualified to make a move.

209
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I will participate in the test of

210
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
the West Water Pool in the Mt. Tianbai.

211
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I will enter the West Water Pool.

212
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
I will use the fastest time

213
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
to get the pill and break through the town.

214
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I will leave the West Mountain.

215
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Okay.

216
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
The elite disciples of all the schools

217
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
will participate in the test of the West Water Pool.

218
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
But there is only one

219
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
in the West Water Pool.

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
I want to see

221
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
if you have the ability.

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
You will only make a fool of yourself.

223
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
You can't get through the test.

224
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
You are making a joke.

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Then master, don't wait.

226
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
I will enter the West Water Pool.

227
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
I will remember everything about the soul world.

228
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I will repay you in my way.

229
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Then I will leave you.

230
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Okay.

231
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes.

232
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
The last place in the West Water Pool

233
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
is in Mt. Tianbai.

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Yes.

235
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Mt. Tianbai is an advanced place.

236
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
It is not a place with great power,

237
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
but a place with great spirit.

238
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
The upcoming water pool meeting

239
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
is the opportunity for us to enter the West Water Pool.

240
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
The water pool meeting

241
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Ranran will definitely go.

242
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Your Highness, this is...

243
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Don't worry.

244
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I know the important things.

245
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
The first place in the water pool

246
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
is always the first.

247
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I need more power

248
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
to hold the water pool.

249
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I need more power

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
to hold everything I want.

251
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I will not give away my chance

252
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
to anyone.

253
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Are you really willing to use this favor

254
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
to save your brother?

255
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
He is my real brother.

256
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Nothing is more important

257
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
than his safety now.

258
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Okay, I promise you.

259
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I will take the life of my family

260
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
and replace it with a wolf

261
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
who wants to eat me.

262
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
My good brother

263
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
is trying to take the crown

264
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
and bury the poison in me.

265
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
He really wants to kill me.

266
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Your Highness,

267
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
you are blessed by the will of the heavens.

268
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Yes.

269
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Sometimes I don't know

270
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
if this life is blessing me

271
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
or hate me.

272
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
The poison is endless.

273
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
This has also made him go into the well.

274
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
I went to the top of the mountain every year

275
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
to poison Liao Yang

276
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
and wait for Qingge to come back.

277
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
But I didn't know

278
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I had already met him.

279
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Now it's hard to confirm

280
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
that it's him.

281
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
But you still told me

282
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
that I would die soon.

283
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
The poison has entered your heart.

284
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You have been a mortal for a long time.

285
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
You can't hold on for long.

286
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
But the waterways in the four directions

287
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
have been planned by you for many years.

288
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
The plan is sure to work.

289
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
You will have the way to the nine lives.

290
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Okay.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Then I can live my life as I want.

292
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
The world is long and peaceful.

293
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Love is always with you.

294
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
What is your plan

295
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
for Xue Ranran?

296
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Ranran will come back to me.

297
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I've waited for her for so long.

298
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
It's not a big deal.

299
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Su Yichui will definitely think of a way

300
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
to let her enter the waterways.

301
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
When the plan is settled,

302
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
we'll talk about it.

303
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Report!

304
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Your Highness, she's back.

305
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
She just came to the Zha Niang Niang's palace.

306
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Your Highness said she wasn't Zha Niang Niang.

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Then who is she?

308
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Who else can it be?

309
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Isn't she that ungrateful

310
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
and blind man like my second brother?

311
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
My brother killed her in the past.

312
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
But she ended up killing Mu Ranwu.

313
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'll take her down right now.

314
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
No need.

315
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Since she still dares to come back,

316
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I might as well treat her as my mother.

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
After all, there are many people in the world

318
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
who have the right to attend the Xisui Conference.

319
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I can't lose.

320
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I have to rely on her to open the last waterway.

321
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
This is arranged by Your Highness.

322
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
What's the plan?

323
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
It's not just about the plan.

324
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Lately, Third Brother

325
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
has been avoiding me

326
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
because of Zha Niang Niang.

327
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
With Third Brother's temper,

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
he won't be too tough.

329
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
He will definitely kill Zha Niang Niang.

330
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Let him be the target.

331
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I'll go.

332
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Qingge.

333
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
I just entered the house.

334
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I saw it.

335
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
You were staring at me like this.

336
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I was worried about you.

337
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I didn't want you to leave the capital.

338
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I knew you were still free.

339
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
But now, the Xuanmen Sect is hard to tolerate you.

340
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I was also worried about you.

341
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I had to send my men to follow you

342
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
and protect you.

343
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Who knew that Fei Fu Jin would lose you?

344
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Fortunately, you came back safely.

345
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm fine.

346
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I just walked around.

347
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I also found some herbs

348
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
to make a medicine for His Majesty.

349
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
So that you won't be worried.

350
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
You're still like this.

351
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
You always think for me.

352
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
But I think

353
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
you should think for yourself.

354
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
I know you.

355
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
You want to catch the person

356
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
who has the life in your hands.

357
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
So,

358
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
even if I want to marry you

359
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
and marry you to the Eastern Palace,

360
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I don't want to move you.

361
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
So you don't want to marry me.

362
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
How is that possible?

363
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm thinking about what you're thinking.

364
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
I know the Xuanmen Sect is going to be destroyed.

365
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
To recover the power of the past,

366
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
you must try to get

367
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
the chance to take the Water-draining Pool.

368
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Right?

369
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Of course.

370
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
But now,

371
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I'm not the one.

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Qingge,

373
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I've been thinking about

374
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
how to use the magical weapons

375
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
that you need.

376
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Just take them.

377
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm waiting for you

378
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
to fulfill your wish

379
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
and marry me

380
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
without any regrets.

381
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Is that okay?

382
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Okay.

383
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Chen Ran.

384
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
I smell a burnt smell.

385
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
It seems that you're really anxious

386
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
to go to the Water-draining Pool.

387
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Chen Ran,

388
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
take a rest in the Six Palace.

389
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
We just went down the mountain to buy

390
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
a lot of delicious food for you.

391
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I even took your letter

392
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
from the gate of the mountain.

393
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I came from the capital.

394
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Ranran,

395
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I hope you can enter the Water-draining Pool.

396
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
When you leave the West Mountain,

397
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
come to the capital at night.

398
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
What's written in this letter?

399
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Why do you look like you're going to cry?

400
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
There's a gift on the letter.

401
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
You...

402
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Master.

403
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
These spiritual treasures

404
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
are the top treasures in the palace.

405
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm willing to train you.

406
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
You're so selfish.

407
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Why are you doing this?

408
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
What?

409
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
You can't bear to lose what he gave you?

410
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes.

411
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Master is so stubborn

412
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
but he's trapped in the past.

413
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
He's getting unreasonable.

414
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Even if you hate him

415
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
no matter how much you hate him,

416
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
you can't punish him

417
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
for what he gave me.

418
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Next time...

419
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
No.

420
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I won't interfere

421
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
if you don't do anything.

422
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Ranran,

423
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
are you going to rebel?

424
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
You're being late.

425
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
How long have you been fighting with Master?

426
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Didn't you notice that

427
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Ranran has been cooking

428
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
and she doesn't even have a master?

429
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Why?

430
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Don't ask.

431
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
We can't help you anyway.

432
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Why do you have to suppress yourself?

433
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
That will only make you lose everything.

434
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I said

435
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I can help you.

436
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Do you have to be so mean to Ranran?

437
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Didn't you say that after she got the golden elixir

438
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
after she got the golden elixir

439
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
she could live her life as she wanted?

440
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Even if she wants to go to the capital

441
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
to get in touch with Su Yu

442
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
you can't control her.

443
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Su Yishui is not a good person.

444
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
But what good is Su Yu?

445
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
She's worth the burden.

446
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
She thought she was the talented person

447
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
who sent her the golden elixir

448
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
but she failed to cultivate her.

449
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Then you can't talk about it.

450
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You have to make a scene with Ranran

451
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
that she doesn't want to come back.

452
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes.

453
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Ranran has her own life.

454
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I have my own path.

455
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
It's the only way

456
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
to make her come back.

457
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Xiaobai, thank you.

458
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm fine now.

459
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
You can't control yourself.

460
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
You have to move forward.

461
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Do what you should do, right?

462
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm going to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

463
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll go to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

464
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I'll go to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

465
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I'll go to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

466
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I'll go to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

467
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
I'll go to Tianmaishan tomorrow.

468
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I made you enough elixir.

469
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Put it in Uncle Yutong's room.

470
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Remember to eat it every day.

471
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
And then get some rest.

472
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Master, the visitor is here.

473
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I sent a disciple of Mount Kong to Tianmaishan.

474
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I happened to pass by you.

475
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Please sit down.

476
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Actually,

477
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I came to see her.

478
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
She's teaching Ranran now, right?

479
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I have no evil intentions.

480
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I knew from the beginning

481
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
that the Mu Qingge who was born in the mountain of snow is fake.

482
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I've been watching her all these days.

483
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
And Su Yishui, who have you been watching?

484
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
It's obvious.

485
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
So?

486
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I should have told the sect leader at this time.

487
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
They are in a hurry to find out where Lin Quan is.

488
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
And the real Mu Qingge is the key.

489
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
But don't worry.

490
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I didn't tell anyone.

491
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Lin Quan has nothing to do with her.

492
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Lin Quan is with me.

493
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I will send Lin Quan back to the Youqin.

494
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
You are honest to me.

495
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Xuanmen wants Lin Quan.

496
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
It's no use to bother her.

497
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
You don't have to show it.

498
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
She is not Mu Qingge now.

499
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I knew it 19 years ago.

500
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
The reason you revived her

501
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
is not to relieve yourself at all.

502
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
It's not for yourself at all.

503
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
It's not for any reason you said.

504
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You love her.

505
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I knew it earlier.

506
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
So I was jealous.

507
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I wanted to see you and her.

508
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I pretended to be embarrassed by her.

509
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
But

510
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
everyone believed it.

511
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Except you.

512
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Because she didn't want to do such a thing.

513
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
So I figured it out.

514
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I used to try to take it.

515
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I have been waiting for it.

516
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I should have let it go.

517
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
About Lin Quan.

518
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
About Lin Quan.

519
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
If you are willing to believe me,

520
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I can help you.

521
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
No need.

522
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I heard that

523
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
the key to open the Youqin

524
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
should be waited until it is fixed.

525
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Or

526
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
you have other channels to open the Youqin.

527
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
By the way,

528
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Mu Qingge

529
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
has found that channel, right?

530
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
What do you know?

531
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I was young and vigorous.

532
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I was a chess player.

533
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I used to follow him for a while.

534
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Xuan Tian Jiao Zhi.

535
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Why did the witch

536
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
find the channel of the Youqin?

537
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
She just lost it

538
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
after a short time.

539
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Then the witch made a mistake.

540
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
It's all in the past.

541
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Xuan Tian Jiao Zhi.

542
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Director.

543
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Brother and I

544
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
have searched the library.

545
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
There is a Xuan Tian Jiao Zhi

546
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
in Xishan.

547
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
But after you closed the door

548
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
19 years ago,

549
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Su Yu came to ask for Mu Qingge's belongings

550
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
and took some things away.

551
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Xuan Tian Jiao Zhi

552
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
is among them.

553
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Is Xuan Tian Jiao Zhi

554
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
really the one

555
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
that the Youqin

556
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
has been in for a long time?

557
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
But it has been there

558
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
for a hundred years.

559
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Why didn't anyone

560
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
find it before?

561
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
We'll know

562
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
after we get it.

563
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
It seems that after the meeting,

564
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
we have to meet Su Yu.

565
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
We are going

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
to the Tianbai Mountain to practice.

567
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Master,

568
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
please don't tell anyone.

569
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
No matter what you do,

570
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
no matter what your plan is,

571
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
it's not right to be a disciple.

572
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I, Xue Ran Ran,

573
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
am here with you

574
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
to set off to Tianbai Mountain.

575
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm here to inform you

576
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
to take me to the water pool

577
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
and get the elixir.

578
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Then we'll go to the West Mountain

579
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
to say goodbye.

580
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Ran Ran, you...

581
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Ran Ran.

582
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I know you are angry.

583
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
But if you don't

584
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
keep your words,

585
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
you'll put yourself

586
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
in danger.

587
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Wouldn't it make people

588
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
more worried?

589
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
I've been thinking about it.

590
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I've seen it clearly.

591
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Our master is very good.

592
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Don't say anything bad again.

593
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Thank you, Senior Brother.

594
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
But I've made up my mind.

595
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
I must go to the water pool.

596
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Master.

597
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
If you can go to the water pool

598
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
to get the elixir,

599
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
why should I force you

600
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
to be a capable disciple?

601
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
It's a pity that

602
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
you are capable.

603
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Get more elixir and talisman.

604
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
In case you fail,

605
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
you'll be laughed at.

606
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Thank you, Master.

607
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Thank you, Master.

608
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Hey.

609
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Not everyone can

610
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
get the elixir in the water pool.

611
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Are you so confident

612
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
that Master can get through?

613
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I have my own arrangement.

614
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
What arrangement?

615
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Close the door.

616
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Close the door?

617
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Master is taking risks, you're closing the door?

618
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Do you have any other intentions, Su Yichui?

619
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Su Yichui!

620
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
The Mount Tianbai is just ahead.

621
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
We're here.

622
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
You don't have to worry about me.

623
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Even if I leave Mount Xi,

624
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
we'll be friends forever.

625
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
You left because of Master, right?

626
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
It doesn't matter if it's not.

627
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
I didn't plan to be a capable disciple.

628
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Isn't it better to eat and play?

629
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I'm not a capable disciple.

630
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm just a disciple.

631
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm not a capable disciple.

632
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
It's not better to eat and play.

633
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Besides,

634
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
we didn't even see the pool.

635
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Isn't it ridiculous to be sad?

636
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
According to the old rules,

637
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
the first to find the pool in Mount Tianbai

638
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
is the winner.

639
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
But the Mount Tianbai

640
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
is restricted by the ability of the Dun Tian.

641
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
It's impossible to fly.

642
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
It can't be a skill to avoid the punishment.

643
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Moreover,

644
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
the leaders and elders of all sects

645
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
have already entered Mount Tianbai.

646
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
So,

647
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
we can't protect our disciples

648
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
from entering the mountain.

649
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I've checked the ancient books.

650
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
The pool used to be not a place in the human world.

651
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
It's a secret place in the immortal world.

652
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
It was discovered by the founder of the Jiuhua Sect,

653
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Dun Tian.

654
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
He was a master of swimming and training here.

655
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
He was able to fly in the future.

656
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
After he flew,

657
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
he specially opened this place.

658
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Every 19 years, he opened it once.

659
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
So, the pool has the blessing of winter.

660
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Fortunately, there is a circle-shaped handle here.

661
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Even if it doesn't work,

662
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
it shouldn't be too dangerous.

663
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
We have to be extra careful.

664
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Since it's a circle-shaped handle,

665
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
we can't enter the pool.

666
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Isn't it a bit too much to be so careful?

667
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
You can only enter Mount Tianbai once in your life.

668
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Once you enter the pool,

669
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
you can avoid doing hard work.

670
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Under such competition and temptation,

671
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
anything can happen.

672
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
This Mo Qingge

673
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
has such a high level of cultivation

674
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
and still came to the pool.

675
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
He's really too much.

676
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
After all, he is a reborn man.

677
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
He has never entered Mount Tianbai.

678
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
So, he's not a ghost.

679
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
The top starts with the secret route

680
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
connected to Mount Tianbai.

681
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
BrotherGuang,

682
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
please guide me what to do.

683
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
final destination

684
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Rai Rai

685
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
What's wrong?

686
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Watch out!

687
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Are you okay?

688
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Thisarias is so dangerous.

689
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,920
We don't even know how many Vah-horyi Leh Whoa are out there.

690
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,080
How are we going up there?

691
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Come with me.

692
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Hurry!

693
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,820
undeads, watch out!

694
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,720
Who was that man?

695
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,120
Why did he use a magic bow?

696
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,640
The source is said to have a new holy beast form The Mơ Tê.

697
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,400
I'm a new disciple of the Spirit Land Sect.

698
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
My name is Gui Ba Qian.

699
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
I've never heard of

700
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,560
a person named Xuan Mei.

701
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
The main peak is ahead.

702
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Let's work harder.

703
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Let's go.

704
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,120
No.

705
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,600
I can't hold on

706
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,880
to the rest of my life.

707
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,400
Xi Cui Chi,

708
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,040
the main peak is ahead.

709
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,560
But there's a wide cliff ahead.

710
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,640
My spirit energy is running out.

711
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,800
Now another cliff is coming.

712
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,400
We can't meet it.

713
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,080
How can we get through?

714
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,480
If I can use my full strength,

715
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
the Jiang Nong Hua Bridge will let us pass.

716
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,440
Ren Ran,

717
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
do you have any more energy?

718
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I'll try.

719
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm sorry.

723
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,160
I'm sorry.

725
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm sorry.

726
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm sorry.

727
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,320
We made it.

728
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,040
If I can use my spirit energy to stabilize my body,

729
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
we can get through.

730
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
Yan Er?

731
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,360
Yan Er!

732
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,600
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

733
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,840
Hurry,psych описании.

734
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,880
Hurry.

735
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,320
хотя

736
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,480
Pretty

737
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,920
I can use theever

738
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,520
to get through

739
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,200
forget it Ran ran

740
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,640
ni Geoffery

741
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,280
Said

742
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,240
Come

743
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm a monk.

744
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,720
I'm not meant to be with you.

745
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,160
It's already great

746
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,520
to come to Mt. Tianmai.

747
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,560
Ranran,

748
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,320
be careful.

749
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,160
Wait for me!

750
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,560
Ranran,

751
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,760
it's dangerous.

752
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,920
It's good

753
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,200
to eat and drink in the West.

754
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,720
côt you find her?

755
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,080
You also know her?

756
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,120
She's mine!

757
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
Fromوجely sizable land

758
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,520
knows智 feng.

759
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
Why did he stop

760
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,360
abusing us?

761
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,680
That's just a dead vaiag rotation.

762
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,620
We

763
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,960
get rivients in the mountains

764
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,440
to make waterNET.

765
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
Why does everybody

766
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,760
visit Fan's Lord for the blue foods?

767
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,080
Hot pot!

768
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,920
Goes on sale!

769
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,840
Here you go!

770
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Yep

771
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,920
Why is a little bird with its legs paralysis here?

772
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Is Toon found the 102ndATHAN to hold you now?

773
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,960
Little bird, wait, I'll help you with the bleeding

774
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,720
Good taste

775
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,120
You're really smart.

776
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
You know how to fight for what's most valuable.

777
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
I don't understand what you're talking about.

778
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,520
You always look so arrogant.

779
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,320
But in reality, you're actually using the benefits to your advantage.

780
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
It's really disgusting.

781
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
You really like to talk about yourself.

782
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,720
I want to ask you

783
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,320
why you're so obsessed with the title of the top Mu Qing Ge.

784
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,920
Is the name of the name so good?

785
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,320
Where did you put the Grand Master?

786
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,520
Ask me?

787
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,920
Ask me?

788
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
I should ask your master.

789
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,520
He loves Mu Qing Ge so much.

790
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,120
He's the one who's hiding the medicine.

791
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,920
Besides, he's the type to be the only one who can't see.

792
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,120
Mu Qing Ge doesn't want to hide it too far.

793
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Maybe he's hiding it by his side.

794
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,320
Stop talking nonsense.

795
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,120
Give me the pig's trotter!

796
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Pig's trotter, you go first.

797
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Everything in this cave attracts people to be greedy.

798
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
Now the pig's trotter has flown away.

799
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,120
I can be sober now.

800
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,320
I'm very sober.

801
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,720
Especially when you were talking about the grand truth.

802
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm even more sober.

803
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Today is the right day.

804
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,120
So many people died in the Mt. Tien Mai.

805
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Su Yu Shui won't know the truth.

806
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,520
Why don't you choose the essence?

807
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,320
To end my good luck.

808
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Xiao Bai, why are you here?

809
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,720
This skill is...

810
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,920
Master!

811
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Xiao Bai used Master's skill.

812
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Is it a Soul-guarding Spell?

813
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Could it be that Master heard what I said

814
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,320
and believed that Mu Qing Ge was a fake

815
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,720
before he came back?

816
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
No.

817
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,520
No.

818
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I need to know how Master is.

819
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,120
Senior, please give me some advice.

820
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
How can I return to the Mt. Tien Mai?

821
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
My Master is fighting with a bad person.

822
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm afraid that he...

823
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,320
You're thinking about your Master

824
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,120
and you don't care about other people's herbs?

825
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,520
I'm sorry.

826
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,320
I was in a hurry.

827
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
How about this?

828
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,720
I'll use Mu Xie's spell

829
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,920
to help you get rid of the herbs.

830
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,320
Please tell me how I can return.

831
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I should know

832
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,720
that everything has its own fate.

833
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,320
You and I are not meant to be.

834
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,720
I can't help you.

835
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Why don't we count as fate?

836
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,320
The Nine Immortals of Mount Cuiwei

837
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,920
are my friends.

838
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,520
I even made some wine for them.

839
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,720
How do you know that I know the Nine Immortals?

840
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,520
How do you know that

841
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
we're enemies?

842
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,520
Your wine jug is exactly like the Nine Immortals'.

843
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
If you have a grudge,

844
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,120
why would you bring the wine jug of the Chou family?

845
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,520
You're a smart girl.

846
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,720
That's right.

847
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
The Nine Immortals are my brothers.

848
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,320
I'm the Medicine Immortal.

849
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,720
If that's the case,

850
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I'll give you a heart.

851
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Every time I try to practice,

852
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,720
when I reach the Baibao Cave,

853
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:42,720
I can't help but be tempted by the

854
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
pain of the past.

855
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,120
Is it too strict?

856
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,320
You can just leave the mountain if you're not qualified.

857
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Why would you kill yourself?

858
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,520
The power of the spirit is eternal.

859
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,920
It's against the will of the heavens.

860
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,720
If you want to enter the water pool,

861
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,320
you have to take the risk

862
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,520
to get a step up.

863
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,120
Then my master...

864
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Is this your master?

865
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
It's indeed my master's power.

866
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,520
My master used the spirit tree

867
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,320
to record it on Xiao Bai.

868
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,720
The moon falls, the night flies, the snow falls.

869
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,720
The sky is blue, the clouds are dark, the sky is blue.

870
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Tears are like dreams, this moment is so beautiful.

871
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
The moon in front of me, you return.

872
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,720
The heart is still in the water.

873
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,720
The tears in the mirror, the heart is still in the cocoon.

874
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,720
The moon in front of me, you return.

875
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
The moon in front of me, you return.

876
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,720
The wind is still blowing.

877
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,720
With you, I'm not afraid of the world.

878
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
If I can be the one,

879
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I'll be with you forever.

880
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
I can't beat the heavens,

881
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,720
I can't beat the heavens, I can't beat the heavens.

882
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Why is it that I can't see the future?

883
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,720
I chase after the eternal night.

884
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,720
I just want to be with you, day after day, year after year.

885
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,720
If I can be the one,

886
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,720
I'll be with you forever.

887
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
I can't beat the heavens,

888
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I can't beat the heavens, I can't beat the heavens.

889
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,720
I've been longing for you,

890
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I've been longing for you,

891
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,720
for a lifetime.

892
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,720
I've been longing for you,

893
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
for a lifetime.
