[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,900
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,930
Su Yishui is no longer here.

4
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,680
What?

5
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you here to seize this body?

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,890
Jade Pool, lend me your spiritual energy!

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Shui,

8
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
I know the void in your past

9
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,960
has made your spiritual sense unstable.

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
But you said before

11
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,680
that you wanted to find the answer on your own.

12
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,740
Don't let the devil

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,680
trap your heart.

14
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
Stop dreaming.

15
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,430
How long do you think you can hold on?

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
You're no different from other demons.

17
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,710
You occupied such a good mortal body,

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,770
but didn't even gain any advantages?

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,870
I'm different.

20
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,280
The wisdom I gained from two lifetimes

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
has allowed me to perfect

22
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,590
the formation I created.

23
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, even if I can't wake you up,

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,060
I'll take you down,

25
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,560
tie you up, and bring you back

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,020
to teach you a good lesson.

27
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,870
What a pity.

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,470
The power of the Spirit Spring is truly strong.

29
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,560
Even with the power of the heavens and earth that I borrowed,

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,090
it was hard to take him down.

31
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,430
He's only just fallen into demonic ways,

32
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,720
and he's already this difficult to deal with.

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,710
If the Spirit Spring

34
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,030
becomes fully adapted to this mortal body,

35
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,430
I'm afraid no one will be able to defeat him.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,530
Miss Xue,

37
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,910
his goal this time

38
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,270
is the spiritual channel of the Eternal Sect.

39
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,730
So what they need is the spiritual channels.

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,880
It seems now that the energy

41
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,680
the Three Thousand Realms Tower needs

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,140
relies on the spiritual channels

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,340
of the Five Heavenly Sects' mountains.

44
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,079
I'm afraid the Five Sects

45
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,680
are all their targets.

46
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,870
Leave!

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Leave! All of you!

48
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,910
My Lord!

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,930
My Lord,

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,220
one of the scouts following Elder Tu

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,020
has returned.

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,240
Quick,

53
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,930
bring him in immediately.

54
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,400
My Lord.

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,250
Greetings, My Lord.

56
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,360
Did she regret it

57
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,310
and not go far?

58
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,000
Does she look toward the direction

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,750
of Mount Scarlet Flame from time to time?

60
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,270
Elder Tu used a speed talisman

61
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,620
and didn't stop once as she headed south,

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,560
reaching a village at the foot

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
of Mount Cold Autumn.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,530
She rented a small courtyard by a stream

65
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,730
with trees and fields

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,840
and settled there.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,290
She ran quite far.

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,370
The south is very humid.

69
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,600
Living in that small village

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,360
probably isn't very convenient.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
Can she get used to it?

72
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,000
Elder Tu's injury hasn't healed yet.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,060
She didn't do much.

74
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
She just sits in the courtyard every day,

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,830
staring at the distant mountains in a daze.

76
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,070
Why was she in such a hurry to leave

77
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,750
when her injury hadn't healed?

78
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,170
Find a doctor she doesn't know,

79
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,390
have him check her condition,

80
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,159
no matter the method,

81
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,360
and help her recover.

82
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,820
But...

83
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,390
don't let her notice.

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,270
Yes.

85
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,560
Wait.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,830
She...

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,130
just looks at the mountains every day?

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,140
Is that the life she wants?

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,500
Doesn't she get bored?

90
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,830
The villagers there are hospitable.

91
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,000
They often visit her,

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,630
bring her things, and chat with her for a while.

93
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,000
Elder Tu doesn't refuse.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,750
Talking and laughing,

95
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,270
half the day goes by just like that.

96
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,670
She...

97
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,000
She laughs?

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
She often laughs.

99
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,580
I don't even remember

100
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,830
what she looks like when she laughs.

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,830
She hasn't laughed

102
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,110
in front of me for a long time.

103
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,640
No matter who you are,

104
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,760
[Hollow Sect]

105
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,000
you are not allowed to trespass

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,060
on the Hollow Sect!

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
Your opponent is me.

108
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,040
You really came with the intention

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,830
of targeting the spiritual channel of the Hollow Sect.

110
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,360
You really are persistent

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
and hard to shake off.

112
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,320
Don't flatter yourself.

113
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,100
You think I'm here for you?

114
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm here to find my Shui.

115
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,570
We are deeply in love,

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,430
never apart.

117
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
Naturally, wherever he is, I will be there.

118
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,370
Deploy the Sky Enclosure Formation!

119
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,600
He escaped pretty fast.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,860
He's actually this kind of demon.

121
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,030
Ranran,

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
thank you a lot for today.

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,930
Otherwise, the Hollow Sect

124
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,530
would surely have suffered.

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,290
We can only know what Dun Tian plans to do

126
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,770
every time he takes a step.

127
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,480
We're far too passive.

128
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,800
We must figure out the specific method

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
to activate the Three Thousand Realms Tower

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,159
as soon as possible.

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,600
The first step to activate the Three Thousand Realms Tower

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,630
is to obtain

133
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,990
the spiritual power of the Five Heavenly Sects.

134
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,950
You told me to entrust this matter to you

135
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,070
with confidence,

136
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,230
but there's still no progress.

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,360
Isn't it because of

138
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
that troublesome Mu Qingge,

139
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,850
the one you trained yourself?

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,390
Is this girl

141
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,030
really that hard to kill?

142
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,240
Or is it that

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,790
you haven't

144
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,670
fully tamed this body yet,

145
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,940
and that Su Yishui's

146
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,830
spiritual sense is still present,

147
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,530
instinctively

148
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,790
protecting this girl,

149
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,820
so that every time you met her,

150
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,590
you couldn't do anything to her?

151
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,430
He's just a broken spiritual sense

152
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,190
whose soul was cleansed

153
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,520
and has long been completely devoured by me.

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,380
How could there be any instincts?

155
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,620
It's only because that Mu Qingge

156
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,050
has the Gold Refining Fire in her hands

157
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,430
and has cultivated a technique that can

158
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,070
continuously draw strength from the heavens and earth

159
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,940
that she managed to survive for a moment.

160
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,750
Once my demonic energy

161
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,680
fully adapts to this remnant body,

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,480
I will make her die a quick death.

163
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,080
But remember,

164
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,710
time waits for no one.

165
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
If a direct attack is hard to accomplish,

166
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,770
we can always use strategy.

167
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,750
There is a demonic creature in the netherworld

168
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,880
called Two-headed Deceptive Python.

169
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,830
I brought its demonic egg out earlier.

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,159
Come with me

171
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,270
and awaken it,

172
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,890
and all our problems will be solved.

173
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,630
It really is the demonic egg of a Two-headed Deceptive Python.

174
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,670
If it is born,

175
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,920
the Heavenly Sects will definitely fall into chaos.

176
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,130
It's just not yet at the hatching stage.

177
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,010
However,

178
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,230
you can use your pure demonic energy

179
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,150
to aid its incubation

180
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,660
and awaken it.

181
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,549
Is everything you said true?

182
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,450
Your Highness, you still trust me

183
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,720
and secretly ordered me to investigate the matter

184
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,510
of Su Yishui falling into demonic ways at Mount Scarlet Flame.

185
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,200
I will not

186
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
fail your trust.

187
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,840
Now, it has already spread throughout the Heavenly Sects.

188
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,550
The only way for Dun Tian

189
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,930
to activate the Three Thousand Realms Tower

190
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,260
is to sacrifice everything in this world.

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,540
Your Highness!

192
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,030
He never told me.

193
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,290
He never said that

194
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,510
he would destroy everything here.

195
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,370
Your Highness!

196
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,780
Your Highness, your eyes...

197
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,170
Your Highness, since you can no longer see clearly,

198
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,590
why bother with trivial matters

199
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,920
that don't concern you?

200
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,770
Trivial matters?

201
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,460
You recklessly lured demonic creatures

202
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,790
out of the netherworld,

203
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,260
hurting and harming people,

204
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,990
causing chaos among my people,

205
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
and you call these trivial matters?

206
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,960
And you call activating the Three Thousand Realms Tower

207
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,760
and destroying everything here

208
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,110
trivial matters?

209
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,850
How dare you harm my people?

210
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
Your Highness, if you have any questions in the future,

211
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,650
you can ask me directly.

212
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,000
There's no need

213
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,590
for all this trouble.

214
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
You may leave.

215
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,240
But Your Highness...

216
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,840
It's fine.

217
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,810
He doesn't dare to hurt me yet.

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
I need to know now

219
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,200
what will happen when you activate

220
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,060
the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

221
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,110
Your Highness, don't you already know?

222
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
Is there no other way

223
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
or method?

224
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,600
Or are you truly planning

225
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
to destroy the lives of everyone

226
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,990
and everything here?

227
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,850
Your Highness,

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
activating the Three Thousand Realms Tower

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
can bring you back

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,030
to that moment

231
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,840
in the world you long for.

232
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,510
You don't think

233
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,250
such a heaven-defying spell

234
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,440
comes without a price, do you?

235
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,330
Price?

236
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
The price is enormous.

237
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,660
Why did you never tell me this before?

238
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,290
Because it's not important.

239
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,020
Not important?

240
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
This world

241
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,550
is just one of countless others,

242
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,040
one star in the vast universe.

243
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,840
If this world is destroyed,

244
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,670
there will be a new one

245
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
welcoming you.

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,480
And Your Highness,

247
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,510
since you want your wish to be fulfilled,

248
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,970
why do you still care about

249
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,180
the world you've already given up on?

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,890
What are you talking about?

251
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,750
Everything here

252
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,280
isn't just a mere illusion.

253
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
They are all

254
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
existing beings.

255
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,360
And there are my people who trust me,

256
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,620
the people of Great Qi—

257
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,440
how can I just watch them fade away?

258
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
I put so much effort into

259
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,570
achieving peace at the borders

260
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,670
and bringing prosperity and peace to the country.

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,030
And nothing will be left behind?

262
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,480
No.

263
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,910
For you,

264
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
this is just like death.

265
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,150
Are you actually hoping for

266
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,360
a posthumous reputation?

267
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,790
Or is it that

268
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,500
you couldn't bring yourself to do it now?

269
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,960
Don't forget,

270
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,600
the lifespan I forcibly reversed for you

271
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
through magic

272
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,840
can only last for half a year.

273
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,510
After 6 months,

274
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,840
your body will inevitably suffer a backlash.

275
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,360
By then,

276
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,320
it will be even worse than it is now.

277
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,180
Your Highness.

278
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,630
Your Highness,

279
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,430
you can no longer see me clearly.

280
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,290
But I forgot to tell you that,

281
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,080
in no time at all,

282
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,190
you will lose your sense of taste

283
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
and smell.

284
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,630
Your sense of touch will also weaken,

285
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,150
and even your hearing will completely disappear.

286
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,790
By then,

287
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,200
you'll be like a pile of dead flesh,

288
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480
lying there,

289
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,150
day after day,

290
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,240
only waiting for death.

291
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,670
At that time, you will surely long

292
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,670
for the vibrant health you once had,

293
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,790
the vigorous strength you once possessed,

294
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,600
and

295
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,960
those wishes

296
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,100
you could never fulfill.

297
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,340
Your Highness,

298
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,290
do you no longer desire

299
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,580
what I just mentioned?

300
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,680
Are you threatening me?

301
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,750
No,

302
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I dare not.

303
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,030
I'm just reminding you how to choose

304
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,490
between what's important

305
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,720
and what's not.

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,360
Of course,

307
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,630
between yourself and all living beings,

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
you can only choose one side.

309
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,770
Are you actually going to

310
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,410
sacrifice yourself

311
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,080
and willingly enter hell?

312
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,060
You're so smart.

313
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
I don't believe that.

314
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
You're not trying to resurrect a demon.

315
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,510
You are the demon!

316
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,240
You've led me to compromise my limits

317
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
again and again.

318
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,630
I'm afraid that in the end,

319
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,560
I'll lose even myself completely.

320
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,250
Rather than...

321
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,480
Rather than letting that day come,

322
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,750
I would rather die

323
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,010
and destroy everything you've planned,

324
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,530
giving myself a clean slate.

325
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,360
How was it?

326
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,560
Was this the closest you've ever been

327
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
to death?

328
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,080
How did it feel?

329
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,040
You're tricking me?

330
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,600
How dare I?

331
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,240
Shouldn't you be grateful

332
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,220
that I stopped your impulse

333
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,360
and gave you another chance at life?

334
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
You should cherish the present now.

335
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,960
Despicable.

336
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,090
Your Highness,

337
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
as long as you can fulfill your wish,

338
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,990
what does it matter

339
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,430
to be a little selfish

340
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,520
or despicable?

341
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,470
You are heaven's chosen one.

342
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,080
How can ordinary people compare

343
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,210
to your importance?

344
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,440
Only when you activate the Three Thousand Realms Tower

345
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,630
can you truly escape

346
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,600
from death

347
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,500
and fulfill the ideals

348
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,030
and ambitions that are now beyond your power.

349
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,080
Uncle Ye Xin.

350
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
That day at Mount Scarlet Flame,

351
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,720
I knew you would

352
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,960
arrange everything.

353
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,480
I shouldn't have gone there

354
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,940
without your permission.

355
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,000
But I sincerely

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
wanted to help you.

357
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,790
Wu,

358
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,750
I don't hate human greed.

359
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,150
After all,

360
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,540
it's desire that creates existence

361
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,270
and myriad worlds.

362
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,440
However,

363
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,620
I hate lies that shatter at the slightest touch.

364
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,360
Uncle Ye Xin, I was wrong.

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,550
I just hope that

366
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,630
when you activate

367
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,490
the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

368
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,200
you'll take me with you.

369
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,490
I also want to go to that world—

370
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,720
a world without Mu Qingge,

371
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,569
a world where I can lead

372
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,000
the Heavenly Sects.

373
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,790
As for what happened at Mount Scarlet Flame,

374
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,790
you didn't really affect anything.

375
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't blame you.

376
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,640
As long as you handle the tasks

377
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,700
I ask you to do well.

378
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,070
I will do my best.

379
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,510
Next,

380
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,750
I will hide Su Yu

381
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,070
in a secret place

382
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,250
and let him rest.

383
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,130
Take good care of him.

384
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,750
Don't let any accidents happen.

385
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,260
Got it.

386
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,170
I wonder how he's doing now.

387
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,400
It's still not working.

388
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,750
Dun Tian used a formation

389
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,960
to isolate Su Yishui.

390
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
I can't contact him using spiritual power.

391
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,250
I must think of another way.

392
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,770
Master.

393
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,200
Zeng.

394
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,890
We received this letter just now.

395
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:18,970
It says

396
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
that a demon python is causing trouble in Mount Cold Autumn,

397
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,460
and they hope we can go eliminate it.

398
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,750
Not attacking the Heavenly Sects

399
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,590
but targeting the common people?

400
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,240
Is this one of

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,640
Dun Tian's plans as well?

402
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,310
I'll go and check it out right away.

403
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,440
If anything happens at the Wester Sect,

404
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
inform me immediately through sound transmission.

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,350
Okay.

406
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,950
[Mount Cold Autumn]

407
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,930
Sovereign.

408
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,880
I told you to take good care of her.

409
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,790
Where is she now?

410
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,450
Sovereign,

411
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,200
Elder Tu received a request for help from the villagers

412
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
and went deep into the mountains to eliminate a demon.

413
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,340
She hasn't returned for two days.

414
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,720
There's a strong demonic aura in the mountains.

415
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,450
I searched all night last night

416
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,990
but...

417
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,510
but still haven't found her.

418
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,070
Useless!

419
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,270
She actually has the kindness to eliminate demons?

420
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,330
And she hasn't returned for two days?

421
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,200
What kind of powerful demon could

422
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,880
be here in such a small mountain,

423
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,610
capable of trapping my people?

424
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,210
Let's go!

425
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,160
Run!

426
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,020
Run!

427
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,840
There's a demon in the mist!

428
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,310
There's a demon in the mist!

429
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,240
Help!

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,260
Come out and talk to me.

431
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,230
I don't have time to play with you.

432
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,480
I only know that in this world,

433
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,270
there are Deceptive Pythons that are good at hiding.

434
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,510
It's the first time I've ever seen

435
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,310
a two-headed Deceptive Python.

436
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Did you eat her?

437
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,830
There's no trace of her spiritual power

438
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,290
in this Deceptive Python.

439
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,950
Tu Jiuyuan?

440
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,750
These demon wolves are quite something.

441
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,810
Their fangs are surprisingly sharp.

442
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,200
Are you alright?

443
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Why are you here?

444
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,750
I encountered this Two-headed Deceptive Python

445
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,310
and thought you had been killed.

446
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,870
I've been calling for you all over this mountain

447
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,400
and finally found you here.

448
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,880
I'm fine.

449
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,680
You don't need to worry about me.

450
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,250
Don't go.

451
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,880
The demon wolf's aura is poisonous.

452
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,140
You can't be careless.

453
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,070
Only by resting will the wounds heal faster.

454
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,070
Come back with me.

455
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,530
What...

456
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
What happened here?

457
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,810
-This...
-Wait.

458
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,580
Don't move!

459
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,750
-Who are you?
-You're fake.

460
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,290
I'm the real one.

461
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,070
You're the fake.

462
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,610
You're the fake!

463
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,410
Hurry up and kill the extra ones.

464
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,630
It's in chaos.

465
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,960
Everything's in chaos.

466
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,880
I need to inform

467
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,640
Elder Wen about this.

468
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Bad news!

469
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,940
Elder Wen!

470
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,110
What happened?

471
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,440
The blood of that strange python

472
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,270
can duplicate a person identical

473
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,200
to the original.

474
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,730
What kind of demonic technique is this?

475
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,400
Elder Wen!

476
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,720
Elder Wen!

477
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,080
You...

478
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,760
When did I...

479
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,110
get duplicated?

480
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,720
It's clearly you impersonating me.

481
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,110
The Hollow Sect's Heart Technique is never taught to outsiders.

482
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,090
Each of you, use the technique and attack me,

483
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,150
and I'll know immediately whether you're real or fake.

484
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,410
Elder Wen,

485
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,840
please forgive me.

486
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,100
Even the techniques you use are identical.

487
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,960
If you can't tell the difference,

488
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,280
I have a way to find out.

489
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,680
So you're all fakes!

490
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,290
Be careful!

491
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,350
Don't let the blue blood touch you!

492
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,750
Yes!

493
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,110
Elder Wen,

494
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
you're the only one left.

495
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,920
You may leave now.

496
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,350
Yes!

497
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,550
Don't leave tonight.

498
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,590
Stay and keep me company.

499
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Jiuyuan,

500
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,960
only you

501
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,590
can make my heart flutter like this.

502
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,550
You shameless imposter!

503
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,630
How dare you impersonate me!

504
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,880
I will kill you!

505
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,920
You demon.

506
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,510
It's one thing to impersonate those blockheads

507
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,910
from the Heavenly Sects,

508
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,110
but how dare you come to my Celestial Sect to cause trouble?

509
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,750
Today,

510
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,270
you won't escape.

511
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Guards!

512
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,110
Arrest him!

513
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Are you all blind?

514
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,800
He's the imposter!

515
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm the real one!

516
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,770
Tu Jiuyuan,

517
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,510
come on.

518
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,440
Even you can't tell the difference between us?

519
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,340
You said you've loved me for decades.

520
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,000
You've only been gone for a few days,

521
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,460
and now you're denying it?

522
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,300
Jiuyuan

523
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,070
is the love of my life.

524
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,450
Now she's even carrying my child.

525
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,880
Treating her like a treasure isn't even enough for me.

526
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
You demon.

527
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,270
You can't even make your act convincing,

528
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,530
and actually dare to shout at my Jiuyuan?

529
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,850
You're actually...

530
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,970
You're actually pregnant?

531
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
How could this be?

532
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,620
Was it that day,

533
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,320
when we...

534
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,550
Catch that demon.

535
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,680
How are you feeling now?

536
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,550
You were deceived by this demon

537
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,640
and couldn't tell the difference between us for a moment.

538
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,440
It's just that you were already injured to begin with.

539
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,890
Now,

540
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,110
staying by this demon's side,

541
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,840
you must be even more cautious.

542
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,870
Remember,

543
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,960
never touch their blue blood.

544
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,560
Don't let them replace you.

545
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,830
Move!

546
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,720
Behave!

547
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,270
You demon,

548
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,160
your skills are just mediocre,

549
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,890
yet you dare to impersonate me.

550
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,010
I'll kill you right now

551
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
and show everyone

552
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,510
the consequences of impersonating me.

553
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,760
You must remember what I said

554
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,980
and be very careful of this demon.

555
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,840
You're about to die, yet you dare to speak nonsense!

556
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,590
A quick death

557
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,120
would be too easy for you.

558
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,480
You...

559
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,200
My Lord,

560
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,240
this disgusting demon

561
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,420
deserves to die.

562
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Let's throw it down the mountain to feed the vultures!

563
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,570
Jiuyuan,

564
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,640
don't get so angry.

565
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,910
Be careful not to hurt our child.

566
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,120
[Eternal Sect]

567
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,540
I've devoted my life to cultivation.

568
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,680
To die in the Eternal Sect

569
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,350
is a good end.

570
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,640
Master!

571
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,560
Master!

572
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,270
Master!

573
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,440
Don't come over!

574
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,920
What happened?

575
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,550
This demon is a Two-headed Deceptive Python!

576
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,750
Once its blood touches you,

577
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,810
it will create a shadow person of you!

578
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,110
Master!

579
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,110
Senior, run!

580
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,200
After I die,

581
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,550
take over the position as the sovereign

582
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,680
and find a way to eliminate this demon!

583
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,350
Master!

584
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,070
-Senior.
-Senior.

585
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,590
Master!

586
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,200
Run!

587
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,790
Master!

588
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,200
Mas...

589
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,830
Master!

590
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,600
Now, the Eternal Sect has already fallen.

591
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,960
Other sects

592
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,310
will soon follow.

593
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,920
That Deceptive Python is truly an ultimate evil being.

594
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,550
You were actually willing

595
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,880
to release such a demon.

596
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,540
It seems

597
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,730
you're ready to end this game.

598
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,430
If it weren't for someone tempting you back then,

599
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,800
I would've already solved this game.

600
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,710
I'm talking about...

601
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,160
Mu Qingge.

602
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,510
You're still testing me?

603
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,760
Don't worry.

604
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,590
I've already firmly taken control of this body.

605
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,860
I'm not interested

606
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
in his past foolishness.

607
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,270
No wonder you're the Mortal-Demon Lord.

608
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm quite relieved.

609
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,440
Look,

610
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,750
the regal bearing on you

611
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,510
has finally returned.

612
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,750
Once we take control

613
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,110
of all the spiritual channels,

614
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,200
the 3000 worlds

615
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,960
will be ours

616
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,590
to roam freely.

617
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,280
Is it only the spiritual channels?

618
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,900
What are you trying to say?

619
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,240
The spiritual channels are just the energy to activate the tower.

620
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,510
If the tower's core is unstable

621
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,830
and unable to bear this energy,

622
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,230
all our efforts will eventually be in vain.

623
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,030
Therefore,

624
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,240
we must find

625
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,070
the most suitable place in this world

626
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,670
to serve as the tower's core.

627
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,770
Where is this place?

628
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,120
The Mortal-Demon Lord is truly is wise.

629
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,890
Don't worry.

630
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,200
I've already found

631
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,460
the perfect location.

632
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,880
Master!

633
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,640
Master!

634
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,000
Master!

635
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,840
Master!

636
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,520
Now, the sect has been occupied.

637
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,000
Remember,

638
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,200
they only have memories from the past few months.

639
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,130
You can ask them about past details

640
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
to determine

641
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
the authenticity of those you know.

642
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,360
Master!

643
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,030
Master!

644
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,260
Right now, I'm severely injured.

645
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I have to entrust

646
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,670
the Hollow Sect to you for now.

647
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,920
Master, be careful.

648
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,260
Please sit down first.

649
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,660
Hongshan!

650
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Sovereign Wen...

651
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,710
Hongshan,

652
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,680
I know that in the current situation,

653
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,410
you can't trust anyone easily.

654
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
This is a letter from Miss Ranran.

655
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,350
She says she has found a way to counter the enemy

656
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,110
and invites all the Heavenly Ones

657
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,440
to go to the Wester Sect.

658
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,130
It is indeed in Ranran's handwriting.

659
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,320
How can you prove

660
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,590
that you are the real you?

661
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,590
You like the aloofness of plum blossoms the most

662
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,510
and hate the flamboyance of peonies.

663
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,980
Among all the landscapes in the mortal world,

664
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,880
your favorite is Yueyang Tower.

665
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,550
You've been there seven times.

666
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,200
I secretly memorized

667
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
all these things.

668
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,990
If that's not enough,

669
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I can say more.

670
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,570
Enough.

671
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,650
Let's...

672
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,140
Let's first settle my master,

673
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
then we will go to the Wester Sect together.

674
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,550
Tu Jiuyuan.

675
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,680
Ranran.

676
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,200
Elder Wen,

677
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,080
Elder Yan.

678
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,650
You demons!

679
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,000
How dare you come here?

680
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,730
Elder Wen, why did you say that?

681
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,350
After we eliminated the demons in Mount Cold Autumn,

682
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,310
we received a letter from the Wester Sect and came here.

683
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,770
Why wouldn't we dare come?

684
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,750
We saw Elder Wen's body

685
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,950
at Mount Cold Autumn.

686
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,030
I think

687
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,440
you are the fake one.

688
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,440
All the sects of the Heavenly Sects are here.

689
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,970
You think you can take us on?

690
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,090
You're also a demon!

691
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,820
Be careful!

692
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,730
What exactly is going on here?

693
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,750
The records in the Xuantian Teachings mention

694
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,590
that these shadow people are almost indistinguishable

695
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,750
from their original bodies,

696
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,590
with no flaws,

697
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,400
and can gradually

698
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,350
replace them.

699
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,880
The only flaw is that

700
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,530
under the midday sunlight,

701
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,400
the shadow people don't cast any shadows.

702
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,640
That day,

703
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,680
when I went to Mount Cold Autumn to eliminate the demons...

704
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
There's a snake!

705
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,740
There's a snake ahead!

706
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,200
Miss,

707
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,790
don't go any further.

708
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,000
There's a demon python in the mountain.

709
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,930
Hurry up and run.

710
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,640
Uncle,

711
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,240
I received your letter.

712
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm here to eliminate demons and uphold the Way.

713
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,240
That's great!

714
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,770
Where is that demon?

715
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,400
It's right over there,

716
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
deep in the dense forest.

717
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,070
I realized

718
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,470
none of them had shadows,

719
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,970
which reminded me of the records in the Xuantian Teachings.

720
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,600
Thanks to you,

721
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,920
the Heavenly Sects have hope now.

722
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
But these demons are too troublesome.

723
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
We can't kill them all,

724
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,360
and the more we kill, the more they multiply.

725
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,020
I don't know

726
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,150
what we should do in the future.

727
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,670
Yes.

728
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,400
It's hard to determine who exactly to kill.

729
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,360
But if we don't kill them,

730
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,020
they'll blend into our ranks.

731
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,880
In this way,

732
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
the fall of all major Heavenly Sects

733
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
will only be a matter of time.

734
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,830
We must quickly find

735
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,610
a way to eradicate them.

736
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,190
Before that,

737
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,400
you should settle in the Wester Sect and have a rest,

738
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,860
building up your strength

739
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,760
and waiting for the chance to reclaim the mountain.

740
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,820
Thank you, Ranran.

741
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,320
Last time, they failed to attack the Heavenly Sects,

742
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,440
and this time, they used shadow people

743
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,190
to infiltrate and try to seize the spiritual channels.

744
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,760
This must be for the Three Thousand Realms Tower again.

745
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
The enemy is hidden while we are exposed.

746
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,110
We can't just sit and wait for our doom.

747
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,440
We must quickly uncover

748
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,770
the origins of the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

749
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,670
But the Heavenly Sects

750
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,920
have been investigating for a long time

751
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,120
and found no records.

752
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,800
The Heavenly Sects may not know,

753
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,030
but there is one person

754
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,360
who might know about it.

755
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,530
Let's do it this way.

756
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,600
The annual ancestral worship ceremony

757
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,290
is crucial for the nation's peace and stability.

758
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,500
Nothing can go wrong.

759
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,350
Go ahead and prepare at the Ancestral Temple.

760
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,070
Yes.

761
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,320
I'll take my leave now.

762
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,750
You may all leave now.

763
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,880
Yes.

764
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,510
You want to govern diligently and love your people,

765
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,280
so you want to pray to the heavens.

766
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,140
But the heavens

767
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,890
did not grant you much time.

768
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,110
You're already this sick before ascending the throne.

769
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,440
How pathetic.

770
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,710
Who let you in?

771
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,960
Get out.

772
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,220
Dun Tian told me to monitor you day and night.

773
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,290
Seeing you cough like this,

774
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,360
I had to come in

775
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,550
and check on you.

776
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,650
If anything happens to you,

777
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,080
I wouldn't be able to explain it.

778
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,400
You used to rely on your sister,

779
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,760
and now you rely on Dun Tian.

780
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,750
You've exhausted all your efforts in scheming across two lifetimes,

781
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,550
yet you've never truly controlled

782
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,510
your own fate.

783
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,670
Don't you find yourself more pathetic?

784
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,070
You...

785
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,030
You're no better.

786
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,110
You've been blindly

787
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
loving Mu Qingge for two lifetimes,

788
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,030
but in Mu Qingge's heart,

789
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,570
there has always been only Su Yishui.

790
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,110
There's not even the slightest room for you.

791
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,880
Get out!

792
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,870
Tell Dun Tian,

793
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,440
he has trapped me in this palace

794
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,110
for so long.

795
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,280
I must attend the ancestral worship ceremony tomorrow.

796
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,810
If he wants you to follow me,

797
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,510
you must wait outside the temple

798
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,080
and not come in to disturb me.

799
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,370
[Imperial Ancestral Temple]

800
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
You may all leave.

801
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,030
Yes.

802
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,110
Yu,

803
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,480
it's me.

804
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,230
Qingge.

805
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,670
You're back.

806
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,250
I've remembered

807
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,170
everything from the past.

808
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,000
I've been waiting for you.

809
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,190
I knew that one day,

810
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,320
you would come back.

811
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,360
Yu, your body...

812
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,270
has declined to this extent?

813
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,360
Imperial physicians said...

814
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,240
I only have half a year left.

815
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,210
Don't worry.

816
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,680
I will make

817
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,310
the best elixirs to save you.

818
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,540
Qingge.

819
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,960
You know this is not

820
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,020
what I want to hear.

821
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
In the past, you protected me

822
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
for so many years.

823
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,370
Have you...

824
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ever loved me?

825
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,110
Whether as Mu Qingge

826
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,040
or as Xue Ranran,

827
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,390
I've always seen you as a friend,

828
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,190
a confidant.

829
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,060
I don't believe it.

830
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,380
I don't believe it.

831
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,000
If I hadn't asked you

832
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,730
to save my ungrateful brother,

833
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,280
you wouldn't have met Su Yishui,

834
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,620
and you wouldn't have fallen in love with him later!

835
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,110
If it weren't for that,

836
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,880
you might have loved me,

837
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,030
right?

838
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,510
Right?

839
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,280
Yu!

840
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,440
I don't casually say things

841
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,640
that never happened.

842
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,110
The more we look back on the past,

843
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,840
the deeper we get trapped in it.

844
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,010
Don't fall too deep.

845
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,230
No!

846
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,550
Since Dun Tian gave me this chance,

847
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,150
I must go back and take a look!

848
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,360
Even if you and I still miss each other,

849
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,670
I can always

850
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,710
go to a new world,

851
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,620
a world where only you and I exist,

852
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,740
a world without Su Yishui.

853
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,220
Among the 3000 worlds that will descend,

854
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,960
there must be one

855
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,960
where you love me.

856
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,520
There must be one

857
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,880
where everything

858
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
is perfect for me.

859
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,610
There's no perfection in this world.

860
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Even if it exists,

861
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,260
if it comes at the cost of erasing others,

862
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,390
can it really be called perfect?

863
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,770
Yu,

864
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,560
the reason people are different

865
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,560
is simply due to their different experiences.

866
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,330
Even if you replace

867
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
a perfect Su Yu,

868
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,550
with the people around you

869
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,610
not sharing the same memories as you,

870
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,520
that body

871
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,480
will be nothing but an empty shell.

872
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,360
In such a world,

873
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,930
you'll only feel even more lonely.

874
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,360
Besides, Yu,

875
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,760
do you know that once the Three Thousand Realms Tower is activated,

876
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,930
the world before you

877
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,020
will be destroyed?

878
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,250
The people you claim to love

879
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,650
and the lands you've vowed to protect,

880
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,800
will all vanish in an instant

881
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
because of your whim.

882
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,710
Yu,

883
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,840
in this world,

884
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,130
even though you have many regrets,

885
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,630
at least you still have me as a friend

886
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,760
and Feihua's companionship.

887
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,560
If all of this were to disappear,

888
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,170
wouldn't you feel regretful?

889
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,670
Yu,

890
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,580
come with me.

891
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,640
I will do my best to save you.

892
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,210
As long as I'm here,

893
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,660
you'll never take Su Yu away.

894
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,320
Wu.

895
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,000
On the day you returned my spiritual power,

896
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,880
I already decided

897
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,290
that our debts were settled

898
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,280
and I wouldn't hold anything against you.

899
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,760
In the previous life, you already made a mistake.

900
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,590
In this life, you're still obsessed,

901
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,960
making one mistake after another.

902
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,290
When will you turn back?

903
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,100
My mistake

904
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,560
is not making you perish into ashes

905
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,480
when we were in the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.
