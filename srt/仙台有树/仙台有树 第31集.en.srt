[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,890
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,160
Now, tell me,

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
what exactly happened to Mu Qingge?

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,789
Otherwise,

6
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,240
you two wouldn't need to stay here.

7
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,970
We dare not hide the truth.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,530
Mu Qingge indeed died once.

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,400
However,

10
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,550
you had her reincarnated and revived,

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,230
and you placed a restriction on her appearance,

12
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,640
making her unrecognizable to everyone.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,310
What?

14
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,440
Guardian, please let me explain everything.

15
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,190
Out of consideration for my bond with that demoness—

16
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,390
master and disciple—

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,829
I used a half of my Golden Core to revive her?

18
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,960
Going to the netherworld to seal the Spirit Spring

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,800
was also something she entrusted me with?

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
Are you kidding me?

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,930
Every word I said was true.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,650
Then what about Xue Ranran?

23
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,870
What does she have to do

24
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,870
with me reviving Mu Qingge?

25
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,520
Why does she carry

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,120
the energy of my Golden Core?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,030
Actually...

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
there were two fruits

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,960
on the Reincarnation Tree.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Besides Mu Qingge,

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,090
the other one was Mu Ranwu.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,190
Xue Ranran...

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,840
Though her appearance is different from her past life,

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,870
she is Mu Ranwu.

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,360
Yes!

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,470
Xue Ranran is Mu Ranwu.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
She accidentally

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,310
perished with Mu Qingge

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,400
back then.

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,430
When you activated the Reincarnation Tree,

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,680
you saved her as well.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,360
Your Golden Core just so

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
happened to enter her body.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Mu Ranwu?

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,840
Alright.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,120
Since she's that

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
two-faced woman,

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,400
I don't need to hold back anymore.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Just kill her.

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,870
G-Guardian, you can't do that!

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,710
Why not?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
You... you...

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Since her...

54
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,710
reincarnation,

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,600
you've fallen in love with her.

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,150
Are you out of your minds?

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Everything I say is true.

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
I can make a soul oath

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,920
that you really like Xue Ranran.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,750
You personally brought her to Mount Wester

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,550
and treated her with great care.

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,000
You even risked your own life

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,860
to protect her.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,710
Everyone on Mount Wester knows it,

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,560
and many in the Heavenly Sects have seen it.

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,220
Guardian, you can ask around.

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,690
Even if it was true in the past,

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
it has nothing to do with the present me.

69
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,430
I would never make

70
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,079
the weak mistake of falling in love,

71
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,740
especially not with Mu Ranwu.

72
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,210
I suppose the reason

73
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,520
I haven't ascended in the past 20 years

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,850
might be because of her.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,770
Alright.

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,890
I'm going to kill her now

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,430
and take out the Golden Core,

78
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,760
so that she won't disturb my cultivation.

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,560
Guardian!

80
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,570
Step aside.

81
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,190
Wu,

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,310
why are you here?

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,690
Please forgive me, Sir.

84
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,560
Since we were in the netherworld,

85
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,220
I've wanted to speak with you,

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
but never had the chance.

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,390
That's why...

88
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,760
Why have you started calling me "Sir"?

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,390
Uncle Ye Xin.

90
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,560
That's more like it.

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,700
If there's anything you want to ask me,

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,670
feel free to ask.

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,390
In my past life, someone gave me a Soul-Devouring Lock.

94
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,360
That was me.

95
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
So, from the moment

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
you took us in,

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,170
you had already planned for what would come next?

98
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,120
Wu,

99
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,560
as you know,

100
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,480
I really cared for you

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,750
and your sister.

102
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,680
It's just a pity

103
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,760
that your sister was too talented–

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,830
so much so

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,570
that it became a hindrance.

106
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,720
So I used you

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,070
to eliminate her.

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,330
You're not happy about it?

109
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,720
No.

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm not.

111
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,190
Of course not.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,090
That was also your desire.

113
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,040
You took your sister's

114
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,630
spiritual power and Spirit Root,

115
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,430
but your cultivation declined instead of rising.

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,360
You're indeed not suited for the Heavenly Sects.

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,510
However,

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,040
considering that you helped me

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
escape the netherworld,

120
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,820
I should repay your kindness.

121
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,740
I'll help you remove the scar

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,340
that you care about the most.

123
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,120
Also,

124
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,750
do you still want to

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,120
be above your sister?

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
Uncle Ye Xin, can you help me?

127
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll teach you some

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,850
special cultivation methods.

129
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,910
As long as you obediently

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,640
do what I told you to do,

131
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I promise you'll get what you want.

132
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,830
Master,

133
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
I made some elixirs

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,190
and was about to bring them to you.

135
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,750
You still have some injuries.

136
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,010
These elixirs should be very effective.

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,159
So you're Mu Ranwu.

138
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,480
Yu Tong and Yu Chen told me

139
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,020
that I've fallen in love with you.

140
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,600
That's absolute nonsense.

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,630
It seems that my two uncle masters

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,630
are helping me cover up my identity.

143
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,870
The most boring thing in the world

144
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,600
is those lovesick men and women

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
clinging to each other through life and death.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
How could I be one of those

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
who indulge in love and romance?

148
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,430
Tell me.

149
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,920
What is your true intention

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,120
in being by my side?

151
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,760
What intention could I have?

152
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
My only intention

153
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,360
is you, Master.

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,870
It's just that you've forgotten.

155
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,240
We've long made an oath

156
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,430
to never part

157
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,830
and have confessed our true feelings to each other.

158
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,920
To save me

159
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,830
and protect me,

160
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,560
you brought me to Mount Wester.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Look,

162
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,040
this tree.

163
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,190
We planted it together

164
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,370
shortly after I came to Mount Wester.

165
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,070
You said that

166
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
with a tree,

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
we had roots,

168
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,230
and with roots, we had a home.

169
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
Along the way,

170
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,750
you almost lost your life

171
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,120
just to protect me.

172
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,630
But you

173
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,160
have forgotten all of this.

174
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,310
You don't need to put on

175
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,510
this pitiful face

176
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,310
to deceive me.

177
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,000
You're the younger sister

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,530
of that demoness Mu Qingge.

179
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,480
I remember seeing you once or twice

180
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,540
in the Wester Sect.

181
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,080
Even if I did fall in love with someone,

182
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,510
what about you

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,460
would make me fall for you?

184
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,750
What about me?

185
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,530
Since you don't remember,

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,450
I'll help you.

187
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,030
Do you remember now?

188
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,030
How dare you do this to me?

189
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Do you believe

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,200
I will kill you right now

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
and take back my Golden Core?

192
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,880
The Golden Core inside me is indeed yours.

193
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,930
If you remembered everything

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and wanted me to return the Golden Core,

195
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,280
I wouldn't say a word.

196
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,550
But what is this now?

197
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,880
Are you really going to kill me?

198
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,240
Shui.

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Master.

200
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,970
Master.

201
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,080
Su Yishui.

202
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,030
Master!

203
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,750
Get away!

204
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,000
Stay away from me!

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Su Yishui,

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
have these past 10 years been for nothing

207
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,120
to you?

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,630
You've turned back into that brat,

209
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,360
haven't you?

210
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,410
Let me tell you,

211
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,520
if you dare

212
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,840
lay even a finger on Ranran,

213
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,020
I will gather all our brothers

214
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
to fight you to the death!

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Oh no.

216
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,360
Ranran's spiritual power is almost depleted.

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,150
With the Soul-Devouring Lock devouring her,

218
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,410
I'm afraid her primal power might dry up.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,930
Are you alright?

220
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,310
The one casting the spell is working for Mu Qingge.

221
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,250
She's trying to steal your spiritual power?

222
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,150
Yes.

223
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,480
I've stabilized the spiritual power inside you.

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,140
You won't be in danger for now.

225
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,090
Thank you, Master.

226
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,480
I just don't want

227
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,750
your spiritual power to be drained,

228
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,150
damaging my Golden Core.

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,610
And for some reason,

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,470
whenever I try to take your Golden Core,

231
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,800
my head starts buzzing.

232
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,870
Anyway, you can't escape my grasp.

233
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,200
I won't kill you for now.

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,670
Take her away

235
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,050
and watch her closely.

236
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,910
Don't let her appear before me again

237
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,710
before I sort out these matters.

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,270
Also, drive my three stupid disciples

239
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,270
off the mountain.

240
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,200
Yes.

241
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,320
Su Yishui?

242
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,950
He now actually

243
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,010
has the ability to break my spell.

244
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,030
Now, Mu Qingge only has

245
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,360
a little spiritual power left.

246
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,560
She used her Formless Spirit Root as a sacrifice

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
and returned Su Yishui's spiritual soul

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to him.

249
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,970
As expected of something Mu Qingge would do.

250
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,800
However,

251
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,310
your spiritual power is enough now.

252
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,630
Continue cultivating with the method

253
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,360
I taught you.

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,200
When I need you,

255
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,890
I will come to call you.

256
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,070
This is the Fanyao battlefield?

257
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,030
Yu Chen said I entered the netherworld

258
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,230
and sealed the Spirit Spring from here.

259
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,440
The Supreme Blood Moon

260
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,770
appears with the blood.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,240
The malicious energy on this battlefield

262
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
has already been exhausted.

263
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,170
The Blood Moon

264
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,000
will not appear for now.

265
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I can only wait for the right time

266
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,460
and enter the netherworld with the secret key.

267
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,360
They said that

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,290
it was someone named Ye Xin who made me lose my memory.

269
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,680
Who exactly is this person,

270
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,420
and what is their purpose?

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Yu Chen discovered

272
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,220
that he had appeared in the capital city.

273
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,430
So,

274
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,790
you really are Mu.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,750
Great.

276
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,770
Liang used to always tell me

277
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,200
you resembled Mu,

278
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,880
but I never believed it.

279
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,250
Good, good.

280
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,720
This is wonderful.

281
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,270
I can finally get to drink

282
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,870
Mu's Mistaken Divine again.

283
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,480
Alright.

284
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,270
You finally saw Qingge again,

285
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,470
and all you can think about is drinking?

286
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you, guys.

287
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,630
Although I only have

288
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,170
a faint memory of the past,

289
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,720
whether it's before

290
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
or now,

291
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,760
you're always my best friends.

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm glad to see you

293
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
like this now.

294
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm really happy.

295
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,120
Happy?

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,910
That brat Su Yishui

297
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,110
is out of control now.

298
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,540
He's even deceiving us

299
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,150
and acting as the master

300
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,390
of his own master.

301
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,850
What a twisted fate.

302
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,840
You two really have a twisted fate.

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,360
Mu,

304
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,480
how should I persuade you?

305
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,820
There's no such thing as twisted fate or good fate

306
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,620
in this world.

307
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,870
All fates

308
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,550
are created by ourselves,

309
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,440
right?

310
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,870
No matter what the current situation is,

311
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,810
I should find a way

312
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,340
to break through it, right?

313
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,450
Have you found any clues

314
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,790
about the talisman made by the Falling Water

315
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,320
I asked you to investigate?

316
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,370
The talisman that was cast

317
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,070
on Su Yishui should be a Soul-Cleansing Charm.

318
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,900
This talisman washes away

319
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,810
all memories after a person

320
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,100
has experienced love,

321
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,060
causing them to return to how they were before.

322
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,400
No wonder he only remembers

323
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,920
when he first arrived at Mount Wester and hated his master the most,

324
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
turning back into that brat

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,600
who didn't understand love.

326
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,370
So, how can we undo

327
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,230
this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

328
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,210
Even you,

329
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
one of the best talismanic cultivators in the universe,

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,250
can't do anything about it?

331
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,320
The Soul-Cleansing Charm

332
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,170
cast on Su Yishui was made from Falling Water

333
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,540
from the netherworld.

334
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,030
Though I'm skilled in talismans,

335
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,980
I am just a mortal after all.

336
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,810
I am powerless against things

337
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,260
from the netherworld.

338
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,100
If it can't truly be undone,

339
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,150
does that mean he really will never remember me

340
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,480
for the rest of his life?

341
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,590
This Soul-Cleansing Charm was cast by Ye Xin.

342
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,870
Since he has the ability

343
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,630
to mobilize the Falling Water from the netherworld,

344
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,630
does he also have the power to undo

345
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,230
this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

346
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,650
We've been wondering about the background

347
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,800
of this person

348
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,860
who has such profound skills,

349
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,520
yet we found no leads at all.

350
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,770
I don't understand

351
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,400
what Uncle Ye Xin intends to do either.

352
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,530
Back then, he adopted me

353
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,840
and my sister Mu Ranwu.

354
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,570
From the bits of memories

355
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,740
I can recall,

356
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,270
he truly treated us well.

357
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,400
But I also remember

358
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,670
that when I tried to seal the Spirit Spring

359
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,200
back into the netherworld,

360
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
he stopped me

361
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,150
and severely injured me.

362
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,140
That was why I used

363
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,000
the talisman that Alcohol Immortal gave me

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
to seal him with all my strength.

365
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,890
But why did he want to seize the Spirit Spring?

366
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,910
And now, what are his intentions

367
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,000
in placing this Soul-Cleansing Charm?

368
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,330
Aside from sealing him,

369
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,610
how much of the past

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
do you remember?

371
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,600
We can only wait and see

372
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,750
what his next move will be.

373
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,410
I'll send a letter to Elder Wen

374
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,670
and see if he can find any leads

375
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,720
on Uncle Ye Xin.

376
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,440
If not,

377
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,150
at least he can remind all the sects to be on guard.

378
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,630
Okay.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
After Liang and I return to Mount Cuiwei,

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,050
we'll try to come up with a plan.

381
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,240
Thank you.

382
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
Don't mention it.

383
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,920
Didn't we agree

384
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,550
to travel the Nine Lands together

385
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,390
and taste all the delicacies of the world?

386
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,750
Why do these things

387
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,810
feel like they happened just yesterday,

388
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,520
but in the blink of an eye,

389
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,880
everything has turned out like this?

390
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,800
Can't sleep?

391
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,640
Come on.

392
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,040
I'll drink with you for a while.

393
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,760
To be honest,

394
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,330
the year you perished,

395
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,310
I hated Su Yishui deeply.

396
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
Even though later I learned

397
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,590
he was deceived,

398
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,640
and he was more devastated and regretful

399
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
than anyone else,

400
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,030
I still resented him.

401
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,160
All these years,

402
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,960
I've never shown him a kind face.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,750
However,

404
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,540
come to think of it,

405
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,790
I also saw with my own eyes

406
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,350
how that brat looked that year—

407
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,720
withered,

408
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
frantically searching for a way

409
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
to revive you.

410
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,900
Though I resented him,

411
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,690
I knew how much

412
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,070
he had sacrificed.

413
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,350
No one expected that when you were revived,

414
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,350
you'd lose your previous memories.

415
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,240
Now,

416
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,420
he's forgotten everything.

417
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,620
It's as if everything—the past, the grudges, the affections—

418
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
has been settled.

419
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,270
The Spirit Spring has returned to its place,

420
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,640
and both the human realm and netherworld

421
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,970
have returned to peace.

422
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,070
It's as if everything

423
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,070
has gone back to the starting point.

424
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,020
So, I suggest

425
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,110
that the two of you might as well

426
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,370
take this opportunity

427
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,460
to end everything,

428
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,200
part ways,

429
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,400
and live your separate lives in peace.

430
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,250
Oh, Master,

431
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,570
my villa on Tea Inscription Mountain

432
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,430
was originally prepared for you.

433
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,720
You should go there.

434
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,520
You can do whatever you want,

435
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
without dwelling on the past,

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,440
and live a happy life.

437
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,120
If I don't dwell on the past,

438
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,330
does that mean it's not there anymore?

439
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,410
Liang Wumeng once said that

440
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,830
this was the fate between him and me.

441
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,970
But I don't believe in fate.

442
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
I don't believe that all that happened

443
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
over the past twenty-odd years,

444
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
from Mu Qingge to Xue Ranran,

445
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
hasn't left any traces

446
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,590
in his heart.

447
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
I don't believe he is still just the same young man

448
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,740
full of malicious energy from back then.

449
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,920
Ranran,

450
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,510
you...

451
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I won't give up on him.

452
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,450
I will definitely help him remember everything.

453
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,400
Well,

454
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,200
I understand your personality.

455
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,930
No matter how much I try to persuade you, you won't change your mind.

456
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,810
But I've thought about it.

457
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,160
It's useless to just wait like this

458
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,070
and do nothing.

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Ye Xin cast a Soul-Cleansing Charm on Master.

460
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Since he's taken such a measure,

461
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,350
it means that Master, who has lost his memory,

462
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,400
is of use to him.

463
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,930
Last time,

464
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,290
in Uncle Ye Xin's cabin,

465
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,440
I found quite a few old books and notes.

466
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,550
Anyway, there's nowhere else to start looking.

467
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,550
Maybe there will be

468
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,280
some clues and answers in them.

469
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,260
[Prince Ping's residence]

470
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,120
After Prince Zong ascended to the throne,

471
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
it seems that due to some agreement

472
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
with Mu Qingge,

473
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,350
the family of Prince Ping was spared

474
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,880
from purging or execution.

475
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,440
They only got exiled to the border

476
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,070
and forbidden to return to the capital.

477
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,200
But Prince Ping's family

478
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
has been scattered.

479
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,000
The most unfortunate thing is that

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Miss Su Xiaoxiao

481
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,480
had already been sent on a mission

482
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,940
by the prince before this.

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,570
She met with an accident

484
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,510
and lost her life.

[Be Righteous]

Su Yishui, you traitor,

487
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,000
you actually dared to come

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
to the capital again?

489
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,070
Madam Battle

490
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,640
will definitely deal with you…

491
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640

492
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,810
You mean Mu Qingge?

493
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,990
If she doesn't come to me,

494
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,550
I'll go to her.

495
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,790
You mere commoners.

496
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,920
I can't be bothered to talk to you.

497
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,150
Go back and tell Mu Qingge

498
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,590
that I'll settle the bill

499
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,960
between her and me in a few days.

500
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,560
Tell her to be well prepared.

503

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,940
you're finally back.

505

Why so flustered?

506
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,670
We...

507
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,750
thought you went to the imperial palace.

508
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,480
Yes.

509
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,220
I wish I could have.

510
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,030
But I took a quick glance.

511
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,110
The imperial palace

512
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,030
was shielded

513
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,450
by a powerful formation.

The person who set up this formation

Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on her?

535

Please punish us, Guardian.

538
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,270
Was it that you couldn't keep an eye on her,

539

are the cultivation methods you had your disciples copy

as punishment when teaching them in the past.

564

you really were a good master.

You've been dedicated to your disciples.

were always very respectful to you.

571
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,160
Anyway, Mount Wester is quite large,

in being a teacher.

Moreover, the cultivation methods here

the reason I stayed here

isn't that I really intend

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,280
with countless battles fought.

690
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,080
Meanwhile, those who have stayed far from the court

691
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,810
have preserved their strength

692
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,930
and become people I can rely on.

693
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,810
Guardian,

694
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,810
the meal is ready.

695
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,440
After being in seclusion for over a decade,

696
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,270
I still haven't reached

697
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,330
the state of inedia

698
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,590
and have to rely on these mundane things to stave off my hunger.

699
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,030
Guardian, you used to eat every meal

700
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,960
without missing any.

701
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,270
Sometimes you even had extra meals at night.

702
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,730
Enough.

703
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,440
Mundane things are considered taboo

704
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,480
and are not conducive to cultivation.

705
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Put it down and leave.

706
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,070
Yes.

707
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:36,960
Yes.

708
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,880
Time changes,

709
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,870
and people's hearts are fickle.

710
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,790
I need to find a way to gather the ambitions

711
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,450
of these scattered generals.

712
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,720
The freshness of that fish?

713
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,400
It seems to have been steamed

714
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,060
with the unique lotus leaves from Mount Wester.

715
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,170
The vegetables were soaked in the morning dew from 6 AM.

716
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,030
Just one meal

717
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,230
can disturb my heart.

718
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,900
Who knows how decadent

719
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,090
and absurd I've been all these years?

720
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,680
Right now, I need to fight with the mundane world,

721
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,480
so I can eat these common things.

722
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,720
Once these matters are settled,

723
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,850
I can resume inedia.

724
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,950
Guardian, you are right.

725
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,830
The dish is beautifully cooked.

726
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,090
Next time, bring more.

727
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,960
Yes.

728
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,270
Yes.

729
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,360
Indeed, with a full stomach, my thoughts are clearer.

730
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,110
I already have

731
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,240
a rough plan in mind.

732
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,810
What should we do?

733
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,750
Guardian's appetite

734
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,360
has long been spoiled by Ranran.

735
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,310
The dishes Ranran made

736
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,570
are already finished.

737
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,480
I can't possibly recreate

738
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,230
that flavor.

739
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,330
I've got it.

740
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,590
Ranran left her recipes in the kitchen.

741
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,850
We can always follow the recipes, right?

742
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,630
As expected of my sister.

743
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,239
Let's go.

744
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,630
Four slices of ginger,

745
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,360
a small pinch of chopped green onions...

746
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,420
Just a small pinch.

747
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,400
I carefully recalled

748
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
every move Ranran made while cooking.

749
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,150
I even mimicked the rhythm

750
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,880
with which she stirred things.

751
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,110
Try it.

752
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,510
How is it? Does it taste similar?

753
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,730
You might as well feed it to the dogs.

754
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,830
You had these skills at noon, but forgot them by the evening?

755
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,670
What are you waiting for? Redo it.

756
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,110
Yes.

757
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,730
Yes.

758
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,540
I didn't sleep all night, and it still turned out like this.

759
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,310
I really am not cut out for this.

760
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,000
If you want to kill me, just tell me.

761
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
No need to be so vicious.

762
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,920
Guardian, even if you think

763
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,320
my cooking skills are not as good as Ranran's,

764
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,280
there's no need to say such hurtful things.

765
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,150
Yu Chen and I have always been poor cooks.

766
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,190
You know that.

767
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,960
Besides,

768
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,560
since Ranran came here,

769
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,710
you've only eaten the meals she made.

770
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,970
In the past, I only ate the meals she made?

771
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,010
This Xue Ranran

772
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,190
must have secretly

773
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,760
cast some kind of spell on me.

774
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,590
Even the meal you liked yesterday

775
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,420
was made by Ranran

776
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,450
before she left.

777
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,030
She was worried that after she left,

778
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,650
you wouldn't be used

779
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,710
to the meals we made,

780
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,440
so she had us learn to cook like she does.

781
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,070
But we've already done our best to replicate it.

782
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,360
We didn't expect that cooking

783
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,220
is even harder than cultivating.

784
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,000
If I had known it was made by her,

785
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,930
I wouldn't have touched that dish at all.

786
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,670
In this life, Mu Ranwu

787
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,570
is actually like Mu Qingge—

788
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,500
fond of cooking.

789
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
How much of my time

790
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,570
have these two sisters wasted?

791
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,760
Oh, Guardian,

792
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,000
there's news

793
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
about Mu Qingge, whom you ordered us

794
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,730
to keep an eye on before.

795
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,630
Strange.

796
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,190
Why doesn't the energy of my Golden Core

797
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,850
feel strong inside Mu Qingge?

798
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,800
Could it be that this half of my Golden Core

799
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,630
has all been absorbed

800
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,090
by that fruit, Xue Ranran?

801
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,290
Sovereign,

802
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,400
it's said that she established a sect last month.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,360
In just over a month,

804
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,920
she has already gathered many followers,

805
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,030
including some experts

806
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,000
who have already had their cores formed.

807
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
You're being quite high-profile here.

808
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
All her disciples say that

809
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,830
cultivating under her guidance

810
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,150
leads to rapid advancement,

811
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,210
with tremendous progress every day.

812
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,540
The spiritual power of the light formation in front of her is extremely strong.

813
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,880
It's from the same powerful cultivator who created

814
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,000
the formation protecting the imperial city.

815
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,860
I'm afraid it's that Ye Xin again.

816
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,840
This person is unfathomable.

817
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,640
His strength is far beyond mine.

818
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,410
We must not act recklessly.

819
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,280
Keep a close watch on Mu Qingge.

820
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,710
She must be scheming something

821
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,070
by recruiting disciples widely.

822
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,150
Once I break the formation of that expert,

823
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,210
I'll deal with her.

824
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

825
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,500
She did remind me of one thing though.

826
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,070
To get revenge,

827
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
the Wester Sect

828
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,880
indeed needs some manpower.

829
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360
Yu Tong, Yu Chen,

830
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
pass on my orders.

831
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

832
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,510
Master is

833
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,320
taking in disciples again.

834
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,070
Does this mean we have a chance

835
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,670
to return to the Wester Sect?

836
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,430
No, that's not right.

837
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,360
When Master drove us down the mountain,

838
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
he said he had no intention of taking in disciples in this life.

839
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,490
He even said taking us in was a mistake.

840
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,990
It's only been a few days.

841
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,970
Why has he started taking in disciples again?

842
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,960
Perhaps these past few days,

843
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,890
he's been bored,

844
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,890
realizing that

845
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,250
he's lonely without us.

846
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,280
Let's go.

847
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,140
When are we going up the mountain?

848
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,000
To be honest,

849
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,030
this time, the Guardian's requirements

850
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,670
for disciples' spiritual power and cultivation

851
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,070
are much higher than before.

852
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,880
Given the current qualifications of the three of you,

853
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,630
I'm afraid…

854
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,630
But spiritual power isn't the only factor

855
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,030
the Guardian considers.

856
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,360
He reserved one spot

857
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,080
for special consideration.

858
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,650
What spot? Just tell us.

859
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,550
It's for people who can make food that suits the Guardian's taste.

860
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,350
We're doomed.

861
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,710
Now we have no chance at all.

862
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,000
Looks like we'll never be able to

863
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
return to the Wester Sect in this lifetime.

864
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,090
Get out!

865
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,670
You actually dare to call yourselves master chefs?

866
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,800
None of you can cook!

867
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,830
Keep looking!

868
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,150
-Yes.
-Yes.

869
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,000
Soul-Cleansing Charm?

870
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,960
Maybe I can find it

871
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,020
in the Omnipotent Talismans Manual.

872
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,580
It's in the talisman section, third row.

873
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,400
Why is this Xue Ranran

874
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,130
everywhere?

875
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,650
It's like being hunted.

876
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,110
Why is there no record

877
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,920
of the Soul-Cleansing Charm anywhere?

878
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
This Ye Xin.

879
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,530
Collection of Entertainment?

880
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,660
The book written by Mu Qingge?

881
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,360
I heard she's an expert in enjoying life.

882
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,020
I'd like to see what she wrote.

883
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,510
Boring.

884
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,690
Chapter of Fierce Beasts?

885
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,590
This Mu Qingge

886
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,920
actually dared to write about me this way?

887
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,460
In comparison, Xue Ranran seems

888
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,380
more reliable.

889
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,730
Pig's blood?

890
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,490
When have I ever eaten such filth?

891
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,920
Anti-aging and anti-decline?

892
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,030
Ridiculous.

893
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,680
Why would I need that?

894
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,380
This one is not bad though.

895
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,500
[Puxin Village]

896
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,610
Wish you all the best.

897
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,630
Great.

898
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,000
After the Nine-Headed Kui'ao was eliminated,

899
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,660
the village has finally regained its vitality.

900
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,400
Master mentioned before

901
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
that Uncle Ye Xin looked familiar.

902
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,070
Could they have met

903
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,190
a long time ago?

904
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,560
Is it Mu Ranwu and mefrom back then?

905
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,610
They don't look like us.

906
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,160
So who could they be?

907
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,920
There are too many mysteries surrounding Uncle Ye Xin.

908
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,960
Who is he really?

909
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,100
And why did he adopt us?

910
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,370
The answer is probably in this portrait.

911
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,510
Found it.

912
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,810
So, the Soul-Cleansing Charm

913
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,710
is unbreakable.

914
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,590
But if the person who was cast with it

915
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,480
falls in love again

916
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,080
with their forgotten lover,

917
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,150
they will naturally remember everything.
