00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,960
[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,870
So you're the real Mu Qingge.

4
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't worry.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
I'll deal with Su Yishui first.

6
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,280
Then we'll settle the score

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
in the previous life.

8
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,360
Master,

9
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,360
what happened?

10
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,150
Why has Wei Jiu's power increased so much?

11
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,960
Because

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,150
in the netherworld, the natural order is reversed.

13
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,440
Su Yishui, the more powerful you are

14
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,280
in the mortal world,

15
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,240
the more

16
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,750
you are suppressed in the netherworld.

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,910
I see.

18
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
So in the netherworld,

19
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm actually the strongest.

20
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Master,

21
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,750
in the netherworld,

22
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,870
let me protect you.

23
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,520
What's that?

24
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,910
Ranran, Yishui,

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
these devil beasts are tough to deal with.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,750
They won't stop until we're dead.

27
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,590
We can't get rid of them at all.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,630
Follow me.

29
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,000
What should we do?

30
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,480
What else can we do?

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Thank you both.

32
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Scarlet Sect has long documented

33
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,590
the netherworld's devil beasts.

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,550
Unless you can instantly

35
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,630
teleport beyond one mile,

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
you can never escape their pursuit.

37
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
The material for these golden talismans is rare.

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Even Eternal Sect can only make

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,150
seven or eight talismans a year.

40
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,520
Yet you have so many.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,550
The teleportation talismans are hard to craft.

42
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
It took me a long time

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,750
to draw them.

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
But there are too many of us.

45
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,940
We can't possibly teleport beyond one mile.

46
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,670
The devil beasts will still catch up to us.

47
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,160
You let your guard down

48
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,310
after the sudden surge of your power?

49
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,040
Su Yishui,

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
give me the Spirit Spring.

51
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
You borrowed Xue Ranran's power!

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,390
One wisp of qi to break the galaxy!

53
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,800
My Lord!

54
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,720
Thanks to you all,

55
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,970
those devil beasts

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,270
will surely attack this place again.

57
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,430
He has done many evil things.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,270
Today,

59
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,070
I'll eliminate this devil first.

60
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,120
Immortal Yan, please spare him.

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
What happened just now was our fault.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm willing to help you all get out of here.

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,570
Please

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
don't hurt His Lordship.

65
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,560
I learned a secret technique,

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
which can temporarily enhance

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,510
the power of magical tools and talismans.

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,630
I beg for your mercy!

69
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,630
We can't delay any longer!

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,510
Then we'll do as you said.

71
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,430
We've finally escaped.

72
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,040
Elder Tu,

73
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,430
your arm...

74
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,070
A secret technique always comes at a price.

75
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,270
Now that we're out of danger,

76
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
please keep your promise.

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,870
This pill

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,270
was made by me.

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
It has remarkable healing effects.

80
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,590
Thank you.

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,680
Wei Jiu,

82
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,160
if it weren't for Elder Tu

83
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,950
helping us escape,

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,240
you'd be dead by now.

85
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,630
The netherworld corrodes flesh and blood.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,630
She's badly injured.

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,480
You should take her back to the mortal world

88
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,480
to recover as soon as possible.

89
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
The peak over there

90
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,510
is the exit of the netherworld.

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,480
You two should also go back as soon as possible.

92
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,720
Ranran,

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,560
let's go.

94
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,270
Wen,

95
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,120
you go back to the mortal world first.

96
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,310
I still have something to do.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,950
What is it?

98
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,020
The devil beasts at the foot of the mountain

99
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,870
haven't given up yet.

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
It's easy for us to escape,

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,330
but Su Yishui and Xue Ranran

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
are still here.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,680
I need to lure

104
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,070
the devil beasts away from them.

105
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I'll go too.

106
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,800
No.

107
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,550
You can't just

108
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,900
spout those noble words

109
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,130
and leave me here

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
to be a coward, right?

111
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,800
Wen.

112
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,480
You're injured?

113
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,040
Let me take a look.

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
The scent of flesh and blood will attract devil beasts.

115
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,870
There's no need to look.

116
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,920
Xue Ranran said

117
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,120
you are badly injured

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
and need to go back to the mortal world to recover.

119
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,040
Is that true?

120
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,600
If I want you

121
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,680
to take me back immediately,

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,510
would you do so?

123
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,510
No.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,560
After all these years,

125
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
I've finally gotten close to the Spirit Spring.

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,870
Even if I can't obtain it,

127
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,870
I must use the Spirit Spring

128
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,870
to cleanse the Blazing Sword

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,420
in order to revive Celestial Sect.

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
How are you really?

131
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm fine.

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
I was just joking just now.

133
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,160
My Lord, just go.

134
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,270
If you delay any longer, Su Yishui will seal the Spirit Spring,

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,240
and you won't have a chance.

136
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,190
But you...

137
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,730
Just stay here obediently

138
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
and wait for me to return.

139
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,390
You already knew his choice.

140
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,780
Why bother asking?

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,670
Tu Jiuyuan,

142
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,110
time to give up.

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,530
I finally found it.

144
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,750
This is the place.

145
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,000
This ancient formation

146
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,030
relies on the extreme cold of the Falling Water

147
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,240
to petrify, freeze, and seal

148
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,840
the Spirit Spring.

149
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Master,

150
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,720
do your best to seal the Spirit Spring.

151
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,960
I'll guard you.

152
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,600
No!

153
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,510
Seal!

154
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,390
Stop!

155
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,960
You are the demon's child.

156
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,440
What you want is the universe.

157
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,690
If you seal me,

158
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,120
you'll regret it!

159
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,360
With two more drops,

160
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,440
you'll be eternally sealed in this formation.

161
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
The descendant of Demonic Sect hiding over there,

162
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,150
help me!

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,510
Wei Jiu,

164
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,510
you've gone back on your word.

165
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,440
What are you going to do?

166
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,670
You'll find out later.

167
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,270
Your disciples and descendants

168
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,670
can't save you anymore.

169
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,320
Mu Qingge's Golden Core?

170
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,840
It's been so many years,

171
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,390
yet it still has power.

172
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,360
Back then, to seal you,

173
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,000
she removed this Golden Core.

174
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,910
Now, with success so close,

175
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,630
I will certainly do my best!

176
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,450
Seal!

177
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,960
Su Yishui,

178
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,690
if you still have

179
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,790
any shred of our master-disciple bond,

180
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,790
just promise me one thing.

181
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,960
I've sealed the Spirit Spring at Wangxiang Pass.

182
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,240
Return it to the netherworld for me.

183
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,870
I'm about to accomplish it.

184
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,200
Only one more drop to go!

185
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,450
Finally, you've drawn

186
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
on the formation's power

187
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,710
to seal the Spirit Spring.

188
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,720
Now I can finally

189
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,080
release my senior.

190
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,570
It's indeed Uncle Ye Xin.

191
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,120
It's been so many years.

192
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,750
I'm finally free.

193
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,960
Thank you for your help, Wu.

194
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,150
Congratulations.

195
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,240
Long time no see,

196
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,080
Qingge.

197
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,270
No.

198
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,790
I guess you don't remember me.

199
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,670
Now I should call you

200
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,630
Xue Ranran instead.

201
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,750
There's a booklet here.

202
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,600
This must be Uncle Ye Xin's portrait.

203
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,790
Guess

204
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,910
who I will

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,720
give this to.

206
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,480
Me.

207
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,320
Me.

208
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,360
It's yours.

209
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,790
Qingge.

210
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,670
I didn't expect you

211
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
to venture into the netherworld.

212
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,480
Uncle Ye Xin.

213
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,120
Qingge,

214
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,200
give me the Spirit Spring.

215
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,440
You

216
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,750
are Uncle Ye Xin who raised Mu Qingge.

217
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,480
You're also the fallen immortal

218
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,670
who stopped her from sealing the Spirit Spring.

219
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,910
Exactly.

220
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,360
Ranran!

221
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,030
He's dangerous. Don't go near him!

222
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,120
It was Mu Qingge

223
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,390
who sealed me here

224
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,380
and stopped me from obtaining the Spirit Spring.

225
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,510
Now,

226
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,200
I'll obtain it from him!

227
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,360
I don't care who you are.

228
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,840
No one is allowed to disturb my master!

229
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,790
Fine.

230
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
I'm going to kill you right now!

231
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,270
Ranran!

232
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,600
Master!

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,390
We went through so much

234
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,000
to get here!

235
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,910
Our effort can't be wasted!

236
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,840
You must seal the Spirit Spring.

237
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,120
Leave him to me!

238
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,080
Ranran!

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,790
Ranran!

240
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,550
Master,

241
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,480
don't be distracted!

242
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,840
I have a technique to borrow power.

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,750
I can hold on!

244
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,340
Seal!

245
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,450
Ranran!

246
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,880
Master!

247
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,030
Are you alright?

248
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,590
Oh no.

249
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,480
The gate of the netherworld is closing.

250
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,350
Ranran!

251
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,440
Sealing the Spirit Spring

252
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,000
really makes me angry.

253
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,420
But it doesn't matter.

254
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,360
Now let's play another game.

255
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,550
Master!

256
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,550
Master,

257
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,310
you're so nice.

258
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,790
Master!

259
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,720
Are you alright?

260
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,400
Where is she?

261
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
Could it be the devil beasts got her?

262
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,240
The formation flag is intact.

263
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,420
She should be safe.

264
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,310
She actually left first!

265
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
I specially took a detour to come back to her,

266
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,480
but she

267
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,550
left without me!

268
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,350
I'll settle the score with her later.

269
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,210
[The exit of the netherworld]

270
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,440
Master.

271
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,160
Who are you?

272
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,830
Why do you have my spiritual power's energy?

273
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,110
Master,

274
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,720
what's wrong with you?

275
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,320
No one can stop me

276
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,790
from standing at the pinnacle of this world.

277
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,270
Mu Qingge,

278
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,880
I'll kill you right now!

279
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,680
Master,

280
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,750
you're awake.

281
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,350
Master.

282
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,310
Who are you guys?

283
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,510
You called me Master.

284
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,440
What trick are you playing?

285
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,400
Master.

286
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,240
Master!

287
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,850
Master!

288
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,510
Master!

289
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,110
Why?

290
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,960
You have no power at all,

291
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,550
but why do you have my spiritual power's energy?

292
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,270
Who are you?

293
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,310
Don't you recognize me anymore?

294
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,720
Answer me!

295
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
You gave me

296
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,440
the spiritual power yourself

297
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,790
in order to save me.

298
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,880
Who do you think I am?

299
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,160
It's her.

300
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,440
You're all her accomplices!

301
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,550
Mu Qingge!

302
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
Show yourself!

303
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,680
You won't come out?

304
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,000
Fine.

305
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,210
I'll kill you

306
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
and take back my spiritual power first!

307
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,160
Master!

308
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,030
Guardian!

309
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,680
You can't do this.

310
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,160
Yu Tong?

311
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,920
Yu Chen?

312
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,720
It's us.

313
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,200
Guardian, you still remember us.

314
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,000
Why have you grown so much?

315
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Haven't we... always been by your side,

316
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,030
serving you?

317
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,400
May I ask you a question, Guardian?

318
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
What year do you think it is now?

319
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,640
The 47th year of Fengping.

320
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,200
Guardian,

321
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
it's now the 19th year of Zhengyong.

322
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,590
From the year you said,

323
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,160
23 years have passed.

324
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Ranran,

325
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,830
are you okay?

326
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,310
Are you hurt?

327
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,590
Just now, it looked like

328
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,790
Master really wanted to kill you.

329
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,830
What on earth happened to Master?

330
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
It was Ye Xin.

331
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,680
In the end, he used the Falling Water to draw a talisman,

332
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,080
but he didn't hurt Master.

333
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,450
There must be something wrong with that talisman.

334
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,270
I'll ask Alcohol Immortal

335
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,830
to see what kind of evil magic it is.

336
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,720
I won.

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,510
It doesn't count.

338
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,480
I drowsed when I

339
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,200
made the previous move.

340
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,310
Let's play again.

341
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,160
Once a move is made, there's no turning back. You should admit defeat.

342
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,280
We had a deal.

343
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,690
Whoever wins the last round

344
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,680
gets the last jar of Mistaken Divine brewed by Ranran.

345
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,430
Liang,

346
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,400
in the first half of this round,

347
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,270
I had the upper hand.

348
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,240
How about

349
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,240
splitting the wine 50-50?

350
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,310
You're trying to cheat?

351
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,720
No!

352
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,160
I... I'm telling the truth!

353
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
At least in the first half,

354
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,590
I had the upper hand!

355
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,510
So give me

356
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,680
half of it, okay?

357
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Give it to me.

358
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Put the wine down first.

359
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Let's hear what Ranran has to say.

360
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,750
We still need her to brew wine for us in the future.

361
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,680
Su Yishui has suddenly forgotten

362
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,440
everything that happened in the past 20-odd years.

363
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,510
Doesn't that mean

364
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,680
he's even forgotten

365
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,620
about causing Mu's death?

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
This guy

367
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,790
is so heartless, even when he lost his memory!

368
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,960
Ranran said

369
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,830
someone used a drop of the Falling Water,

370
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,880
and then Su Yishui couldn't remember anything.

371
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,700
Do you remember any talisman that needs to be drawn

372
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,570
with the Falling Water?

373
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,830
The Falling Water

374
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,280
isn't something from the mortal world.

375
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,790
Who would use it?

376
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,640
Unless...

377
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,880
he's not from the mortal world.

378
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,790
Are you drunk?

379
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,110
Isn't that obvious?

380
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,160
My brother knew I was good at talismans.

381
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,610
Before he attained ascension,

382
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,200
he copied two talismans from the Immortal Realm for me.

383
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,270
But they are

384
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,200
impractical talismans

385
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,380
requiring rare materials.

386
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,030
Liang.

387
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,790
Where are they?

388
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,680
Hurry up and look for them.

389
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,070
If we help Ranran,

390
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,640
it'll be easier to ask her for wine in the future.

391
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,640
That's right.

392
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,030
I'm going to look for them now!

393
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
You asked some quacks to talk nonsense here.

394
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,720
I don't have any injuries or illnesses!

395
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,350
But Guardian,

396
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,640
you have indeed forgotten a lot.

397
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,110
Mu Qingge did this to me!

398
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,070
Where exactly is she?

399
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,200
She's dead.

400
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Dead?

401
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,030
Yes.

402
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,200
Dead.

403
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,510
How did she die?

404
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
Nineteen years ago,

405
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,610
the four Heavenly Sects

406
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,880
created the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Curse.

407
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,170
They lured Mu Qingge

408
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,160
into the formation and killed her.

409
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,830
She kidnapped me to Mount Wester

410
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,160
and made me suffer all kinds of humiliation.

411
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,920
Not being able to kill her with my own hands

412
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
is truly letting her off easy.

413
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,350
Those Westers

414
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,480
claim to be my disciples.

415
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,000
Now, I've taken over

416
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,200
Mu Qingge's Mount Wester?

417
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,030
Yes.

418
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,310
Guardian, now

419
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,230
you are the sovereign of Wester Sect.

420
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,510
Then set out for Mount Wester tomorrow

421
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,510
to search Mu Qingge's territory

422
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,510
and see what exactly she did to me.

423
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,350
Bring those

424
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,510
who claim to be my disciples along,

425
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,550
especially the one

426
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,510
who has my spiritual power.

427
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,790
We absolutely can't let her escape.

428
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

429
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,880
Senior Gao,

430
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,310
please escort them out first.

431
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,070
Okay.

432
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Gentlemen, please.

433
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,400
How is he?

434
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,940
He still can't remember.

435
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,000
Unlike the rest of us,

436
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,030
Ranran, you need to be extra careful.

437
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,510
Guardian's memory

438
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,540
seems to be stuck at the time when he was just abducted

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,830
and obsessed with killing Mu Qingge for revenge.

440
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,030
I know I must conceal my identity.

441
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,130
If he finds out I'm Mu Qingge now,

442
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,720
he'll surely kill me and tear me into pieces.

443
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,240
Guardian said he wants to visit Mount Wester tomorrow

444
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,720
to find the reason for his memory loss.

445
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,510
He still believes Mu Qingge is behind all this.

446
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,480
That's fine.

447
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,550
Mount Wester has many immortal herbs.

448
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,640
I also want to make some pills as soon as possible

449
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,960
to see if I can help him.

450
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,240
But with Guardian's current temperament,

451
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,720
if he sees those things on Mount Wester,

452
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,790
who knows what he might do?

453
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,270
It might not be a bad thing.

454
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,000
Since it's amnesia,

455
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,510
more exposure to things from the past

456
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,920
will always be of some help.

457
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,680
What we can do now

458
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
is to avoid making him angry

459
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
and wait and see.

460
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,620
How does it taste?

461
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,110
I always complained about the unfairness of fate,

462
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,200
but actually, what I've longed for all my life

463
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,720
has always been by my side.

464
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
Everything was fine before.

465
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,720
Why did he become

466
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,000
a completely different person within just one day?

467
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,350
Xue Ranran!

468
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,160
Yes.

469
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,200
I just performed my inner energy circulation

470
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,070
and found that I've reached the Transcendence Stage.

471
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,440
And you

472
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,920
have half of my core.

473
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,750
Now, tell me,

474
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
since I've finally reached the Transcendence Stage,

475
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,450
why would I give my core

476
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,920
to you,

477
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,830
a worthless person with no power?

478
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,590
What trick did you play?

479
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,640
No need to play a trick.

480
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,720
You did that

481
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,030
because of our deep bond.

482
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,350
Deep bond?

483
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,640
With you?

484
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,920
That's right.

485
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,350
If you don't believe me,

486
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,540
Master, why don't you look at what you're wearing

487
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,440
and the furnishings in the room?

488
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,080
The sandalwood scent on your clothes

489
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,030
was infused by me.

490
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,680
The tasseled mugwort was picked by me.

491
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,290
That wooden hairpin

492
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,240
was also made by me.

493
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,000
And this.

494
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,880
The dried longan

495
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,270
was also made by me personally.

496
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,830
How dare you insult me!

497
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,830
Get out!

498
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,530
[Jingyang Hall]

499
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,070
Yu.

500
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,000
We meet again.

501
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,880
Why are you here?

502
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't be surprised.

503
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,070
Since I could come here

504
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,750
unimpeded,

505
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,750
of course I have someone to help me.

506
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,590
Someone to help you?

507
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,450
A powerful person

508
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
who can cure you.

509
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,160
Feng,

510
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,310
what's going on?

511
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,590
Master Mu, at the request of me,

512
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,270
has brought that powerful person here.

513
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,750
I spent so many years in the netherworld.

514
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,880
Today,

515
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm finally free again

516
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
to meet you, Your Highness.

517
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
But honestly,

518
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm not exactly a stranger to you.

519
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,000
After all,

520
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,200
a part of me

521
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,400
has been by your side for many years.

522
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,110
You...

523
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,590
You... You are...

524
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,440
one person?

525
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,510
Feng is a fragment of my being.

526
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,880
But now,

527
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,400
he is no longer important.

528
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,400
Previously,

529
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,480
I was sealed in the netherworld by Mu Qingge.

530
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,960
I only left

531
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,110
a fragment of my being in this world.

532
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,720
At that time, I already knew

533
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,960
in this world,

534
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,590
only you can help me.

535
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,750
So,

536
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,680
I transformed into Feng

537
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,510
and stayed by your side.

538
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,750
Who are you?

539
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,480
He is

540
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,520
Uncle Ye Xin, the otherworldly master

541
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
who raised

542
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,310
me and Qingge.

543
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,830
So I became

544
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,920
a part of your game long ago?

545
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,920
Come to think of it,

546
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,920
everything Feng did before

547
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,070
was all part of your scheme.

548
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,480
So, I've ended up like this

549
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,000
because I made a pact with the devil.

550
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,520
Now you actually dare to swagger

551
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,790
before me.

552
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,480
Do you really think the Eastern Palace has no one to defend against you?

553
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,510
You are a smart person.

554
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,880
If I just used some mundane magic,

555
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,350
how could I have deceived you

556
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,110
for so many years?

557
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,920
But today, with my true form here,

558
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,790
I do not wish to be your enemy.

559
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,160
Instead,

560
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,960
I want to cooperate with you.

561
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,590
Cooperate with

562
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,920
a scheming person like you?

563
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
What a joke!

564
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,720
Unless...

565
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,510
you show me

566
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,960
your sincerity.

567
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,680
After all,

568
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
you want something from me,

569
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,030
right?

570
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,960
Then what do you think

571
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,110
I want from you?

572
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,630
I don't know.

573
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,310
After all, for a capable person like you,

574
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,680
both money and power

575
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,590
are within your easy reach.

576
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,750
You would never

577
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,270
stay by my side for them.

578
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,720
You tried to make the Spirit Spring stay in Su Yishui's body.

579
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,400
You failed, yet you still came back to me.

580
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,110
That means I have

581
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,070
something you desperately want.

582
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,710
You are indeed clever.

583
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,120
I used magic

584
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,920
to forcibly reverse your lifespan.

585
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,230
Within

586
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,630
the next six months,

587
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,760
your body

588
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,400
will be like it is today.

589
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,360
What will happen in six months?

590
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,440
In six months,

591
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,219
if our plan works,

592
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,449
your body will still be like this.

593
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,469
Also,

594
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,520
you can have

595
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,110
the power to make everything start anew,

596
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,280
including

597
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,030
the past you regret

598
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,530
and

599
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,480
the power you can't obtain,

600
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,710
as well as...

601
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,190
Mu Qingge.

602
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,110
Everything will be under your control.

603
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,440
Tell me about your plan.

604
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,590
A nobody

605
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,810
like Ye Xin

606
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,280
couldn't possibly know

607
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,000
those mysterious things.

608
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,900
Who are you really?

609
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,630
I am Dun Tian.

610
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,070
You are the founder

611
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,150
of Eternal Sect

612
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,550
and the greatest immortal master in the universe?

613
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,540
But Dun Tian attained ascension

614
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,800
a few hundred years ago.

615
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,320
Why did you disguise yourself as Uncle Ye Xin?

616
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,320
In everyone's heart,

617
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,960
there are things they regret.

618
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,110
I am no exception.

619
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,480
Mother, you made chicken drumsticks?

620
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,550
They smell so good.

621
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,630
Honey,

622
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,710
time to eat.

623
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,510
I'll be right there.

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,550
Sit down.

625
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,410
What a feast.

626
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,670
Why did you cook such a hearty meal today?

627
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,750
Guess

628
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,030
who I'll give

629
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,110
the first chicken drumstick to.

630
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,510
Mother, of course.

631
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,230
Smart girl.

632
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,800
Here.

633
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,150
Your mother must be tired today.

634
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,320
Dun Tian,

635
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,480
if you don't kill our master,

636
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,930
we'll release your wife and children!

637
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,550
Save us! Save us!

638
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
Dun Tian!

639
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,680
Save us!

640
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,800
Dun Tian!

641
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,000
Save our children!

642
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,110
Dun Tian!

643
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,920
Dun Tian,

644
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,150
the ultimate way

645
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,590
to attain ascension is killing devils.

646
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,560
If you let Mortal-Demon Lord go,

647
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,040
you will lose

648
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,230
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

649
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,800
-Father.
-Father.

650
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Think about it carefully.

651
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,840
No! Please don't!

652
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,460
[Immortal Realm]

653
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
Is there any news on the matter

654
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,920
I asked you to handle?

655
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,400
You want to bring your loved ones back to life through reincarnation,

656
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,230
but it's truly impossible.

657
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,630
After attaining ascension,

658
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,440
immortals are not allowed to cling to the mortal world.

659
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,230
Even if you obtain the Reincarnation Tree,

660
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,360
you have to gather the souls

661
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,030
of the deceased and perform the ritual within seven days.

662
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,320
Otherwise,

663
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,280
you can't save them.

664
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,230
Dun Tian,

665
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,880
immortals have long lifespans.

666
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,590
When they have nothing to do,

667
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,440
they tend to reminisce about the past.

668
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,360
But you've been an immortal for a few hundred years.

669
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,920
It's too late.

670
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,110
Just let it go.

671
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,630
I will definitely find a way

672
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,960
to reunite with my family,

673
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,670
even if it means making everything start anew.

674
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
You said

675
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,320
to make everything start anew

676
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,190
requires a few things.

677
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,760
The most important things

678
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,240
are the Spirit Spring...

679
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,280
and Su Yishui?

680
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
That's correct.

681
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,630
What... are you doing?

682
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,420
We're here

683
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,150
to escort the immortal masters of Mount Wester back to the mountain.

684
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,760
The Heavenly Sects truly live up to their names.

685
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,030
They're so generous.

686
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,920
They've hired

687
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,280
all the famous chefs

688
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,320
within the surrounding area.

689
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,800
What a grand gesture!

690
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,620
Then... who hired you?

691
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,000
I did!

692
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,480
-Master.
-Master.

693
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,320
I've been putting up with living

694
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,800
in such a shabby place.

695
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,730
If I have to be exposed to the elements

696
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,510
and ride a sword when I go out,

697
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,850
how is being an immortal master

698
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,800
any different from being a beggar?

699
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,320
Yu Chen, Yu Tong,

700
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,770
replace the carriage at the entrance

701
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,760
with a gold-decorated one.

702
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,510
We still don't have enough servants or cooks.

703
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,190
Keep looking for more.

704
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

705
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,000
Get out of my way!

706
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,760
Master has lost his memory,

707
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,510
but why does it feel like

708
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,670
he's become a completely different person?

709
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,250
When he was at Mount Wester,

710
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
he was never this overbearing and extravagant.

711
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,880
Back in the royal residence,

712
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,800
Guardian wasn't like this either.

713
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,630
What on earth happened?

714
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,440
Perhaps since childhood,

715
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,920
he's been living his life cautiously.

716
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,840
He's repressed his feelings for too long,

717
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,550
and now they're all bursting out,

718
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,670
turning him into such an ostentatious person.

719
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,800
He's changed.

720
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,880
Everything has changed.

721
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
If this wooden hairpin

722
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,360
is taken away again

723
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,420
by someone...

724
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,400
I won't let that happen.

725
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,320
I promise I'll keep it safe.

726
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,800
Now this is how my servants should look.

727
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,670
Yes.

728
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,000
It's just that...

729
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,110
I'm a little...

730
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,880
not used to this.

731
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,370
Why did Master specially

732
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,070
forbid the four of us to ride in the carriage?

733
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,180
He even told us to stay away from the carriage.

734
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,710
What we're wearing indeed

735
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,960
doesn't match the carriage.

736
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,590
No wonder he wants us to stay away.

737
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,800
My father was defeated and died,

738
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,840
losing the empire.

739
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,220
Yet I came here to teach disciples.

740
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:15,810
I spent the past dozen of years

741
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,070
in such an absurd way.

742
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,230
How ridiculous.

743
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,590
There's one more thing.

744
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,230
I'll ask you when we reach Mount Wester.

745
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,770
Think carefully

746
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,480
about how to answer.

747
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,550
Don't forget

748
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,710
I am your guardian.

749
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,560
I've been living in such a shabby place

750
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,710
over the past dozen years?

751
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,870
That Consonance Palace we just passed

752
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,440
looks quite luxurious.

753
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,150
We're going to make your palace even better

754
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,480
than the Consonance Palace right now.

755
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,110
We'll talk about that later.

756
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,110
You two,

757
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,280
enter the Consonance Palace with me.

758
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,710
Ranran.

759
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,190
Ranran, you don't have enough spiritual power.

760
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,040
You just came back and you're already making pills.

761
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,960
It's bad for your health.

762
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,070
I want to help Master remember as soon as possible.

763
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,400
Please help me think.

764
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,030
Is there anything else that can help Master

765
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,840
regain his memory?

766
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Delicious food.

767
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,150
Yes.

768
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,800
Master broke his fast

769
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,480
because of your cooking.

770
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,190
He really loves your culinary skills.

771
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,780
[Consonance Palace]

772
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,510
So this is the Consonance Palace

773
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,590
where Mu Qingge lived?

774
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,510
Yes.

775
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,280
Yes.

776
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,320
You two,

777
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,440
when do you plan

778
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,360
to tell me the truth?

779
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,150
You said Mu Qingge is dead,

780
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,590
but in this Consonance Palace,

781
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,190
her spiritual energy still lingers.

782
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,590
And that Xue Ranran,

783
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,190
who is clearly worthless,

784
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,000
somehow has my core.

785
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,280
She even said she and I have a deep bond.

786
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,190
None of this makes sense.

787
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,110
You didn't tell me the truth.

788
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,440
Tell me now

789
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,070
what really happened to Mu Qingge.

790
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,960
Otherwise,

791
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,550
there'll be no need for you two to stay alive.

792
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,150
I dare not hide anything from you!

793
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,550
Mu Qingge did die once.

794
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,520
But

795
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,880
you brought her back to life through reincarnation.

796
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,070
You also placed a restriction on her appearance

797
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,480
so that no one can recognize her.

798
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,320
What?
