Su Yu has many

4
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,060
Immortal Masters under his command.

5
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,000
Among the three guards,

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,590
there might be

7
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,370
someone like Feng

8
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,410
with sharp eyes.

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
If you can avoid using spiritual power,

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,810
it's best to.

11
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,870
I have a plan.

[Huixiang Spring]

13
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,080
If you make a sound and attract others,

14
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
don't blame me for being merciless.

15
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
Her skills

16
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,530
have surpassed mine by so much.

17
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,520
What do you want?

18
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,320
Why did Su Yu capture my Master?

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,730
What did you say?

20
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,320
Your Master was captured by Yu?

21
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,550
Su Yishui,

22
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,980
such an arrogant person,

23
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,470
has finally met his downfall.

24
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,730
He treated you horribly on the mountain.

25
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,570
Why do you still care about him?

26
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,230
Don't smile too wide.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,590
Be careful not to cut your face on the blade

28
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,590
and get new scars.

29
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,910
Yu captured him.

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
It has nothing to do with me.

31
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,840
Besides, those two

32
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,500
never got alone to begin with.

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Could it be because

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
I went to Mount Wester

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,860
and Yu got jealous?

36
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,710
If you dare to hurt me,

37
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,020
Yu definitely won't let you two off the hook.

38
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,240
Is it really

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,660
that fun to deceive yourself?

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,090
Since I entered the palace,

41
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,590
I've been enjoying

42
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,519
the treatment of a Crown Princess.

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,829
In this world,

44
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,029
the one he truly likes

45
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,120
is me,

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,310
and can only be me.

47
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,070
I don't have time

48
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,670
to argue with you, madwoman.

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,190
Madam Battle,

50
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,120
there's only half a bottle of the scar-removing

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,050
Hundred Flower Dew you requested.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Fortunately, I prepared some

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,040
disguise talismans that don't require spiritual power.

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,500
Even if I enter the palace,

55
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,530
I won't be afraid of being exposed.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,090
I have failed in my service.

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,160
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

58
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,070
I will go outside immediately

59
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
to find more Hundred Flower Dew.

60
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,880
There's no need.

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,570
Let's return to the palace.

62
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,800
Yes.

63
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,590
I will prepare it right away.

Let's wait until nighttime

66
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,600
when the guards on the street are more relaxed.

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
We'll find a way to get close to the Eastern Palace

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,240
to be ready to assist Ranran at any time.

69
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,680
Stop.

Madam Battle,

71

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,720
that everyone entering or leaving the Eastern Palace

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
must be thoroughly checked.

74
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
I apologize for the inconvenience.

75
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,510
Have you seen enough?

76
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,240
I apologize,

disappeared?

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,360
Stop.

83
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,270
You don't need to follow me anymore.

-Yes.
-Yes.

85
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,830
I can't gather even a bit of spiritual power.

86
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,310
The formation in this palace

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,440
is even more powerful than I imagined.

88
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,410
No wonder Master is trapped.

89
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,180
Why are you still here?

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,640
Could it be

91
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,400
that wealth and status have gone to your head?

92
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,950
This person's aura...

93
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,570
Could she be an enemy from the palace?

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
Better to avoid trouble.

95
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,000
What's wrong?

96
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,370
Why do you insist on staying in the palace?

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,430
Haven't you learned your lesson

98
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,630
from the last attack?

99
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,750
The court intrigue

100

is merciless.

101
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,800
The Crown Prince can't protect you at all.

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,270
Staying in the palace means risking your life.

103

If you have nowhere to stay,

You can go there to rest and recuperate.

107

She's showing concern for me.

108

Could she be someone I knew in a past life?

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,190
She doesn't seem to have any ill intentions.

Why don't I

111

use her as a breakthrough?

Su Yishui has been captured?

115

The commotion in the palace just now

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,830
was caused by him?

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,330
However,

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,700
isn't that just as well?

119
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,680
Why would you care

120
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
about someone ungrateful

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
like Su Yishui?

122
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
You should stay far away

from all this.

124

She doesn't know anything.

125
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
And she has a deep misunderstanding of Master.

126
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,940
It seems she won't help me.

127

why have you come here?

Minister Zhou

what I just told you.

135

Who does she think she is?

136
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,550
Master,

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,440
Concubine Zhou's father, Minister Zhou,

138
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
has recently had political disagreements with the Crown Prince.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,160
It looks like they're about to fall out of favor,

140
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,520
so she's come here to you

141
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,120
to curry favor and play tricks.

142
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,800
Master, please don't be deceived by her,

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,290
lest

144
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
you get implicated by this father and daughter duo.

145
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,580
Get out!

146
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,150
Master?

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Master!

148
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,810
Has there been anything unusual with the Winged Immortal

149
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,870
under the Inquiry Pond?

150
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,630
Rest assured.

151
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,510
After the Immortal Master from the Exotic Pavilion

152
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,550
cast the spell again,

153
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,790
he's been very well-behaved now.

154
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,190
He hasn't even surfaced.

155
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,760
This faint spiritual energy...

156
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
It seems to be Master.

157
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,870
Your Highness, please stop.

158
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,850
The Inquiry Pond is a forbidden area.

159
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,840
His Highness has ordered

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,480
that no one is allowed to approach it.

161
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,030
I know.

162
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,960
I just heard

163
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,240
that there was something unusual at the Inquiry Pond.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,970
How is it now?

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
It was just an assassin

166
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,490
who slipped and fell in.

167
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,420
We haven't even found the body yet.

168
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,790
That energy just now was indeed Master.

169
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Master's voice seemed to be in pain.

170
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,220
He's in danger.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Your Highness,

172
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
please leave.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
I don't know how Master is doing.

174
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,290
I need to help him escape from the water quickly.

175
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,120
But the guards here are strict.

176
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,480
Those Immortal Masters from the Exotic Pavilion

177
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,810
no longer carry badges.

178
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,360
How can I secretly

179
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,440
enter the water?

180
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,750
Master!

181
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,120
Master!

182
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,440
Didn't I tell you all to go back?

183
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,670
Why did you still enter the palace?

184
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,670
You're in danger.

185
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,090
How could we leave with peace of mind?

186
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,870
Don't worry.

187
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,210
I snuck in secretly.

188
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I wasn't exposed.

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
Why did you use the Soul Control Technique again?

190
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,510
What exactly happened?

191
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,360
Are you hurt?

192
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,440
Why are you so stubborn?

193
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,700
Do I need you to save me?

194
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,150
My life isn't in danger.

195
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,630
Everything is within my plan.

196
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,560
Quickly go back.

197
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,960
But I clearly saw them

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,290
force you into the pond.

199
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
Now there's a lockdown everywhere.

200
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
What's your plan?

201
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
I can help you.

202
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Do I need to report my affairs to you?

203
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Didn't I

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,600
make myself clear enough before?

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,510
Our grievances are settled.

206
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,790
We have no more connection.

207
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,720
Who told you to be so presumptuous?

208
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,540
I now officially announce

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
that I'm expelling you, this rebellious disciple, from Mount Wester.

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,060
We shall never meet again.

211
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,300
Hurry up and leave.

212
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Only the Master can expel their disciple.

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,730
How can a disciple expel their Master?

214
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,250
What did you say?

215
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,420
Rebellious disciple Su Yishui,

216
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,550
is this how you speak to your Master?

217
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,080
Correct your attitude.

218
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Qing...

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Qingge?

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,270
You finally admit

221
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,270
that I am Mu Qingge.

222
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,080
You—

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
When did you regain your memory?

224
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,910
Do you remember

225
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,400
who hurt and harmed you in your past life?

226
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,810
About the past,

227
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,010
I haven't been able to fully recall yet.

228
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,910
But in the study,

229
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,640
I saw the portrait you painted.

230
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,350
I've already asked Mr. Zeng about everything.

231
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,440
Raising your Master as a disciple

232
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
is such an unorthodox act.

233
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,480
If the Heavenly Sects knew about this,

234
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,750
their jaws would drop.

235
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,790
You kept it from everyone

236
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,780
and kept me in the dark as well.

237
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,190
Didn't you say

238
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,720
the person you love most

239
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
is Mu Qingge?

240
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,960
That's me.

241
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,980
Why did you hide from me and leave?

242
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,500
You don't dare answer, right?

243
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
For the questions you can't answer,

244
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,170
I think I already know the answers.

245
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,320
It's just like what I saw

246
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
in your spiritual sense.

247
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,500
For these 19 years,

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,860
you've been confining yourself.

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,130
Because of the guilt in your heart,

250
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,810
you've sentenced yourself

251
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,010
and sentenced our relationship.

252
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,670
But you forgot.

253
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,320
It was you who used the Golden Core to help me reborn.

254
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
It was you who accompanied me

255
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,030
and took care of me with your spiritual soul.

256
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,480
It was also you who entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,670
to help me form my core at the cost of

258
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,200
ruining your cultivation.

259
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
Even if there were any mistakes in the past,

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,530
everything you've done now

261
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,650
has been an effort to make amends.

262
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,440
It's not enough.

263
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,800
My debt to you

264
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,950
can never be repaid, no matter what I do.

265
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
We can discuss these

266
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,840
old matters later.

267
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,630
Right now, we have more pressing issues.

268
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,490
Tell me quickly how I can help you.

269
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,700
No need.

270
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,910
Everything is fine underwater.

271
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,270
But I still have matters to attend to.

272
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,070
I can't leave the palace for now.

273
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,900
Besides,

274
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,290
my life is not in danger.

275
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,870
You should return to Mount Wester first.

276
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,600
I'll come find you after I've finished my business.

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,730
You're lying again.

278
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,360
You just want to hide it from me

279
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,910
and seal the Spirit Spring alone.

280
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,870
But you fell from the Transcendence Realm for me.

281
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,600
After sealing the Spirit Spring,

282
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,460
you'll never be able to come back.

283
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,270
You always say that the former Mu Qingge

284
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,870
shouldn't have disregarded your wishes

285
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,130
to atone for your sins.

286
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,670
But you're doing all this behind my back,

287
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,080
leaving me to bear the pain

288
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,150
for the rest of my life.

289
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,680
Isn't that just as hateful?

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,030
If you could remember everything,

291
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,290
you wouldn't think so.

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,940
You don't remember anything now.

293
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
You have no right to forgive my past.

294
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,080
Then we can talk about

295
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,940
how to settle things at that time.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,750
I am who I am,

297
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,890
yet I'm not myself anymore.

298
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
After being reborn, I haven't lived

299
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,220
these 19 years in vain.

300
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Why stay trapped in the past?

301
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,270
I've asked Liang Wumeng about it.

302
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,400
In the Xuantian Teachings,

303
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,900
there's a method to restore the spiritual soul.

304
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's take this chance together.

305
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,100
At least we can fight for a future.

306
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,870
You wouldn't even have the courage

307
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,840
to wait for me to regain my memories,

308
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,440
would you?

309
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,440
You said you'd let me judge

310
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,300
and punish you.

311
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,840
Was it all a lie?

312
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,440
But...

313
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,320
I am the Master.

314
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,570
Listen to me.

315
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,330
Tell me quickly

316
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
what your plan is now.

317
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,200
I will definitely help you.

318
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,520
The Xuantian Teachings are...

319
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,390
Master!

320
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,480
Why did he leave before finishing?

321
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,670
Could it be that this Soul Control Technique

322
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,670
consumes too much spiritual power?

323
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,720
I need to go quickly

324
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
to check the situation underwater.

325
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,080
Madam Battle!

326
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,790
Madam Battle,

327
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,180
where are you?

328
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,150
[Madam Battle's Palace]

329
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,600
This place is surprisingly not affected

330
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
by the Eastern Palace's formation.

331
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,640
That's great.

332
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,990
All of you, leave now.

333
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,060
I'm a bit tired.

334
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't want to be disturbed.

335
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,850
Come back to clean up tomorrow.

336
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,550
Yes.

337
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,550
It's perfect to catalyze Divine Tree here.

338
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,570
Divine Tree,

339
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,720
it's all up to you whether I can break this Eastern Palace formation

340
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,320
or not.

341
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Indeed, the study is a restricted area.

342
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
The defensive formation is also stronger.

343
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,160
He is indeed

344
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,960
a diligent Crown Prince regent.

345
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,339
What a pity.

346
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,790
Hurry up, hurry up!

347
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,250
What are you dawdling for?

348
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
While Zhou Feihua

349
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
is still at the training ground,

350
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,700
quickly get him to bed.

351
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,310
Young Master,

352
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,170
what if we get

353
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,930
discovered?

354
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,240
How is that possible?

355
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,900
I've already bribed her maid.

356
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,920
Someone will soon

357
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,110
go to the Crown Prince

358
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,920
and tell him

359
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,440
that Zhou Feihua wants to meet him.

360
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,220
Young Master,

361
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,160
that's a clever move.

362
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,220
Hurry up, hurry up!

363
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,830
You said someone fell into the water in the palace today.

364
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,430
Did you see the body float up?

365
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
The area around the pond has been guarded constantly.

366
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
I couldn't get close.

367
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,920
Mr. Zhou has been investigating for so long,

368
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,440
but there are still no clues.

369
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,350
Perhaps

370
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,780
the story about monsters in the water

371
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,090
is really just a rumor.

372
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,640
This matter is of great importance.

373
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,480
If we don't get to the bottom of it,

374
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
it's worrying.

375
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,010
Go and keep watch again.

376
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,750
Yes.

377
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,220
She's also investigating the monsters in the Inquiry Pond.

378
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,410
Who are you?

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,310
Don't be alarmed, My Lady.

380
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,960
I'm just an ordinary palace maid.

381
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,310
I saw that someone was trying to harm you

382
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,310
and couldn't stand by,

383
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,570
so I came to inform you.

384
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,790
[There's a man in your bed. Quickly take care of this.]

385
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,280
What's going on?

386
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,270
It's all Lin Yeting's doing.

387
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,550
There's no time to waste.

388
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,550
If you don't believe me,

389
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,110
you can go back to your chambers and see for yourself.

390
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,770
Don't waste time here with me.

391
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,440
No.

392
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,290
You have to come with me.

393
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,010
Otherwise,

394
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,280
I'll call for guards right now.

395
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Now do you believe me?

396
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,910
The Crown Prince's people are coming soon.

397
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,890
Everything you said was true.

398
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,760
Concubine Zhou.

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,600
What is it?

400
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,030
My Lady,

401
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,830
after His Highness finishes his official duties,

402
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,240
he wishes to come and visit you.

403
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,830
I've come specially to inform you.

404
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,200
Please convey to His Highness

405
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,510
that I am feeling unwell today

406
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,440
and need to rest.

407
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,640
Please ask for His Highness's understanding.

408
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,070
Yes,

409
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,350
I will relay your message right away.

410
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,440
His Highness heard that

411
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,110
you have been in low spirits lately.

412
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,200
He specially ordered someone to select

413
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
wind chimes offered as tribute from the Western Regions.

414
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,130
They have a calming effect on the mind and spirit.

415
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,570
Hang them up, then.

416
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,070
Yes.

417
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,310
The Crown Prince favors you.

418
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,880
My Lady,

419
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,690
why aren't you happy about it?

420
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,470
His Highness's favor

421
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,690
is just like these wind chimes.

422
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,410
All style and no substance.

423
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
It has certainly made me

424
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,560
many enemies in this palace.

425
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,160
Now that your matter has been resolved,

426
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,360
I shall take my leave.

427
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,640
Wait.

428
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,790
The selection of palace maids for the Eastern Palace

429
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,510
has always been under my management.

430
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,570
How could I have no impression of you?

431
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,650
Who are you really?

432
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,440
If you don't tell the truth,

433
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
I'll really call for guards.

434
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm indeed not a palace maid,

435
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
but I have no ill intentions.

436
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,290
My Lady,

437
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,000
considering I just

438
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,510
saved your life, could you

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
let me off just this once?

440
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,620
If you're not up to no good,

441
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,830
do you dare to explain your purpose?

442
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,640
If I can help,

443
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,530
I'll certainly do my duty.

444
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,730
I am Su Yishui's disciple.

445
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,750
I entered the palace

446
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,110
to save my Master who fell into the Inquiry Pond.

447
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,960
Su Yishui?

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
He killed his own Master.

449
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,350
How could he have

450
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,410
such a loyal disciple like you?

451
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,590
My Lady, you might have a bias against my Master,

452
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,310
but everything I said was true.

453
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,120
The capital has been experiencing unusual weather for months,

454
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,920
and there have been repeated incidents

455
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,860
of cultivators having their pills stolen.

456
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,130
After my Master investigated,

457
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,770
he suspected it was related to the Eastern Palace,

458
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,900
but he got trapped in the Inquiry Pond.

459
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,510
He must have been

460
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,480
trapped by the monster in the water.

461
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
I have to save him.

462
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,680
There really is a monster hidden in the Inquiry Pond?

463
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,650
So it's true.

464
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,170
Do you know something about this?

465
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,790
Before,

466
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,720
one of my father's subordinates

467
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,580
was passing by the palace waterway late at night...

468
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,110
Later,

469
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,920
my father went to investigate the waterway

470
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,110
but found nothing.

471
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,440
Considering that

472
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,830
the waterway is connected to the Inquiry Pond,

473
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,400
he requested permission from the Crown Prince

474
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,350
to open the Inquiry Pond

475
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,880
for a joint investigation,

476
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,050
but he was firmly refused.

477
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,470
Later, that subordinate

478
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,750
fell into the river due to drunkenness

479
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,960
and drowned.

480
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,190
Someone must have killed him

481
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,570
to cover up the secret.

482
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,480
The more they want to keep it hidden,

483
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,880
the more dangerous it is.

484
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,270
I must go down to the Inquiry Pond

485
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,810
and investigate thoroughly.

486
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,920
Is it worth taking such a risk

487
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,640
for someone

488
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,060
like Su Yishui?

489
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,070
People have many misunderstandings about my Master,

490
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,350
but I know in my heart

491
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,680
that he is the person

492
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
who has been the kindest to me in this world.

493
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,680
Now he's all alone,

494
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,790
without any hope.

495
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,040
Other than me,

496
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,360
who else can save him?

497
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,160
He's all alone,

498
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,590
without any hope.

499
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,400
I can give him a hand.

500
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,800
Who else is willing to save him?

501
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,450
I never thought

502
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,790
that after enduring over a decade in this deep palace,

503
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,270
I've become

504
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,870
more cautious in my actions.

505
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,930
Originally,

506
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,270
I had planned to go to the Inquiry Pond

507
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,930
to get to the bottom of things.

508
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,790
How could I possibly

509
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,550
have second thoughts just because

510
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,210
you're Su Yishui's disciple?

511
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,490
Alright,

512
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,330
I can help you this time.

513
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,960
Guards!

514
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,030
There's an assassin!

515
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,960
Where's the assassin?

516
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,020
They went that way!

517
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,750
Search for them!

518
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,150
Hurry!

519
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,730
Let's go!

520
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,750
Wait.

521
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,110
Perhaps I was mistaken.

522
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,510
Let's not make such a big commotion,

523
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,160
lest we disturb the Crown Prince.

524
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,550
Yes.

525
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,160
Yes.

526
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,880
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

527
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,490
What's going on?

528
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,880
The malicious energy in this water runs deep.

529
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Mortal flesh

530
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,130
will be corroded by the malicious energy if you go in.

531
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,800
Su Yishui's body

532
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,110
has been in this water all along.

533
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,370
Isn't that dangerous?

534
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,920
Wait for me on the shore.

535
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,450
But...

536
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,340
I'll be honest,

537
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
my body is a Fruit.

538
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
This malicious energy doesn't affect me much.

539
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll be back soon.

540
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,680
What?

541
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,310
Fruit?

542
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,640
The malicious energy in this water is so strong.

543
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,970
Will Master be alright?

544
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,900
So you do know fear.

545
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,380
You shouldn't have recklessly taken risks.

546
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,550
I was not afraid of the dragon.

547
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,350
I was scared you'd be in trouble.

548
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,670
Master,

549
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,110
why did you use the Soul Control Technique

550
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,770
to control this Green Dragon?

551
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,110
This is the dragon egg

552
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,310
that Meng Zhang lost.

553
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,110
It's this one?

554
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,720
It was supposed to

555
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
incubate for 100 years before hatching.

556
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,240
But Su Yu

557
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,840
fed it countless inner cores

558
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,670
and nourished it with Resentment Liquid,

559
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,640
forcing it to transform prematurely.

560
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
It has also developed a devilish nature.

561
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,310
I should have

562
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,510
immediately sent it back to Dragon Island

563
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,770
and undo the soul oath.

564
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,830
But its malicious energy is too strong right now.

565
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,510
My spiritual power is currently limited.

566
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,030
With my current abilities,

567
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,290
I can hardly protect myself,

568
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,440
let alone prevent the young dragon from causing chaos.

569
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,840
This is the first reason.

570
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,640
Moreover,

571
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,930
after searching far and wide,

572
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,030
I discovered something

573
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,160
on the Green Dragon.

574
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
What is it?

575
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,150
The Xuantian Teachings.

576
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
Su Yu originally

577
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,750
used it as a magical tool to control the dragon,

578
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,750
but unexpectedly, the dragon swallowed it.

579
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm trying to retrieve it.

580
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
I see.

581
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,000
It seems all the key points

582
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,130
are related to the young Green Dragon.

583
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,070
However,

584
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,170
why would Su Yu take the risk

585
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,830
of trapping the young Green Dragon in the palace?

586
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,400
Su Yu's life is coming to an end.

587
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,070
He's raising the dragon

588
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,600
to extend his own lifespan.

589
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,160
What?

590
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,830
It was only after I possessed the Green Dragon

591
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,830
and shared its senses that I learned

592
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,450
Su Yu has long been poisoned

593
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,960
and is on the verge of death.

594
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,830
I guess he plans

595
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,240
to use the Seven Evil Transformation Spell

596
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,680
to merge with the Green Dragon

597
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,610
and gain its 1,000-year lifespan.

598
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,030
To extend his own life,

599
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,000
he's willing to put all the people in the imperial city

600
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
in danger?

601
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,040
We must hurry

602
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,830
to rescue

603
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,830
the young Green Dragon

604
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,200
and send it back to Dragon Island.

605
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,720
That's exactly what I intend to do.

606
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,380
However...

607
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,890
Su Yu has trapped us with a formation.

608
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,110
I need more spiritual power

609
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,640
to break through the chains.

610
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Moreover,

611
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,350
it will take six more days to purify the malicious energy.

612
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,160
That day happens to be the Double Ninth Festival.

613
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,750
I can take advantage of

614
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,110
the noon energy of the Double Ninth Festival

615
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,070
to accumulate spiritual power,

616
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,480
control the dragon to break through the formation,

617
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590
ascend to the sky and enter the sea,

618
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,960
and return to Dragon Island.

619
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,510
But,

620
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,210
Master, what about your body?

621
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,930
Why haven't I seen it all this time?

622
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,830
The malicious energy in the water burns people.

623
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,310
I have

624
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,710
hidden it in a safe place.

625
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,520
Don't worry.

626
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,740
Su Yu won't find it.

627
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh no.

628
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,460
Master, what's wrong?

629
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,640
Someone just used a spell

630
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,590
to sever the connection between me and my mortal body.

631
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,310
I can no longer sense my mortal body.

632
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,920
What?

633
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,720
Could it be that Su Yu

634
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,070
couldn't find you anywhere,

635
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,200
so he's using this method to force you to reveal yourself?

636
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,880
But if the Soul Control Technique

637
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,400
doesn't restore connection

638
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,590
within 24 hours,

639
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,680
you'll never be able to return to your mortal body.

640
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,830
There is a way.

641
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,790
If you place something that belongs to me

642
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,830
near my body,

643
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,020
I should be able to sense it again.

644
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,640
Master,

645
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,440
leave this to me.

646
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,200
The palace is too dangerous.

647
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
He has discovered your true identity

648
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,200
and will stop at nothing to keep you there.

649
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,930
Don't worry.

650
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,310
I have Zhou Feihua now

651
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,440
to help cover for me.

652
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,920
I won't let Su Yu notice.

653
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,060
Plus, I've almost figured out

654
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,030
the underground formation of the Eastern Palace.

655
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,640
Maybe

656
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,590
I can break the formation early

657
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,720
and restore your spiritual power, Master.

658
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,680
You've always protected me before.

659
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,270
Now,

660
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,210
it's my turn to protect you.

661
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,240
I really don't know what to do with you.

662
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,110
You finally made it out alive.

663
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,170
I was worried sick.

664
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,740
Where's Su Yishui?

665
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,530
What's this?

666
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,200
I'll explain when we get back.

667
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Let's go quickly.

668
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,550
The man-eating dragon in the water

669
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,000
is actually raised by His Highness

670
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,060
to extend his life?

671
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,980
That's right.

672
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,640
Once he uses the Seven Evil Transformation Spell

673
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,500
and merges with the Green Dragon,

674
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,050
he can borrow its lifespan

675
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
but will also be controlled by the Green Dragon's malicious energy,

676
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,640
losing his true nature.

677
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,350
The consequences

678
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,350
can't be withstood by the universe.

679
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,740
I never thought

680
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,070
the Crown Prince, who has always been diligent and loved his people,

681
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,630
would become so obsessed.

682
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,160
Once the human heart

683
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,760
is controlled by obsession,

684
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,770
it'll be hard to distinguish right from wrong.

685
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,370
The reason I entered the palace

686
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,570
was because my family promised Qingge

687
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,750
to diligently protect and supervise the emperor.

688
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,310
However,

689
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,170
His Highness has done such a thing.

690
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,500
I have failed to fulfill the wishes of the deceased.

691
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I truly feel guilty towards Qingge.

692
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,880
For the sake of a promise,

693
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,030
you've been persevering alone

694
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,550
in the deep palace for so many years.

695
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,070
That's already impressive.

696
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,790
Plus,

697
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,380
there's still hope.

698
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,110
Once Master purifies the Green Dragon's malicious energy,

699
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,640
he will ride the Green Dragon back to Dragon Island.

700
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,500
You don't need to blame yourself.

701
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Young lady,

702
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,610
you're quite good at comforting others.

703
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,290
I don't know why,

704
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,400
but you and I

705
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,680
indeed hit it off at first sight.

706
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,110
Oh no.

707
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,070
What's wrong?

708
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,600
The transformation rune got soaked and ruined in the water.

709
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,590
It's inconvenient for me to move around in the palace.

710
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,650
There's something

711
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,010
I'd like your help with.

712
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,440
Place something that belongs to me

713
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,510
near my body.

714
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,030
I thought it was something difficult.

715
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,790
This is easy.

716
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,720
Tell me,

717
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,510
where should I put it?

718
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,230
This place

719
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,840
can only be known by you.

720
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,040
Make sure no one else finds out.

721
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,240
It's done.

722
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,440
Great!

723
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,680
Now Master

724
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,940
can return to his body.

725
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,720
Thank you.

726
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,880
However, since you've helped us,

727
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,270
if Su Yu finds out,

728
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,960
you'll be implicated too.

729
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,750
How about you leave the palace with me

730
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,610
after we return the Green Dragon?

731
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Leave the palace?

732
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,280
Do you like the Crown Prince?

733
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,590
As human beings,

734
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
how can there be no feelings

735
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,260
after being together for so long?

736
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,520
It's just that

737
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,830
in his heart,

738
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
there has only ever been Qingge.

739
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
I've long since stopped expecting

740
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,980
any response from him.

741
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,630
If the Green Dragon is released,

742
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,200
His Highness's life

743
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,440
might come to an end.

744
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,360
After years of marriage,

745
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,920
I'll accompany him through this final journey

746
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,850
before thinking about the future.

747
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
The Crown Prince has arrived.

748
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,310
Your Highness, what brings you here?

749
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,500
Your Highness,

750
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,350
allowing this person into my private chambers

751
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,610
seems inappropriate.

752
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,510
My people can't enter,

753
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,680
but outsiders

754
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,300
can be hidden here?

755
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,070
What do you mean by that, Your Highness?

756
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,200
I don't understand.

757
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,240
You help other men plot against me.

758
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,680
Where does your heart truly lie,

759
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,270
Concubine Zhou?

760
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,320
How dare you!

761
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,310
Ranran,

762
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,610
since you're here,

763
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,680
why hide?

764
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
Or must I call you Qingge

765
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,100
for you to acknowledge me?

766
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,680
Qingge?

767
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,730
Wait, don't hurt her!

768
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,820
How did you know I was here?

769
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,520
I not only know that,

770
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,680
but I also know that you and Su Yishui

771
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,480
plan to release my Green Dragon.

772
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,680
A sound transmission talisman?

773
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,710
You eavesdropped on our conversation.

774
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
Su Yishui's plan

775
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,330
was indeed well-calculated.

776
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,340
Unfortunately,

777
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,380
the Eastern Palace

778
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,670
is my territory, after all.

779
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
The malicious energy underwater is too strong.

780
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,650
Su Yishui's mortal body

781
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,710
certainly won't be hidden in the water.

782
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,370
It's likely

783
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,400
that he has already used magic

784
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,710
to transport it back to shore.

785
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,280
However,

786
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,130
we can't find it anywhere.

787
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,750
If he successfully releases the Green Dragon,

788
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,110
wouldn't we

789
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,110
lose both the person and the dragon?

790
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,280
Don't worry.

791
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,590
I can't find him,

792
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,510
but

793
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,600
I can sever

794
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,510
his connection to his mortal body.

795
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,590
Within 24 hours,

796
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,110
he will certainly seek help

797
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,480
to place his personal belongings

798
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,409
within 10 steps of his mortal body.

799
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,560
His disciple,

800
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,440
knowing he's in danger,

801
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,480
will surely do something about it.

802
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,400
Ranran.

803
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,490
I will place

804
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,110
eavesdropping wind chimes throughout the palace.

805
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,040
We'll have no trouble finding him.

806
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,840
Good.

807
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,480
Is it done?

808
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,440
It's done.

809
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,230
Now Master

810
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,490
can return to his body.

811
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,320
Thank you.

812
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,880
Zhou Feihua.

813
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,550
How is it?

814
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,760
Nothing.

815
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,110
Report! Nothing.

816
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,110
Nothing?

817
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,330
Let's go.

818
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,070
Have you found it?

819
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,340
Your Highness,

820
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,410
we've searched

821
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,280
everywhere

822
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,360
but couldn't find Su Yishui.

823
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,490
Impossible.

824
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,670
Could it be

825
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,400
she secretly went somewhere else?

826
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,110
Concubine Zhou's every move

827
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,920
was under

828
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,400
our supervision today.

829
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,360
We've searched every place

830
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,160
she passed by.

831
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,910
It's absolutely impossible for Su Yishui to be hidden there.

832
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,410
That's strange, then.

833
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,670
Concubine Zhou must place his personal item

834
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,510
near Su Yishui's

835
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,970
mortal body for it to work.

836
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,890
But all the places she's been to

837
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,550
have been searched

838
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,280
and Su Yishui wasn't found anywhere.

839
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,800
Could it be...

840
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,320
No.

841
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,450
There's still one place we haven't searched.

842
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,090
My study.

843
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,760
My Lady.

844
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
His Highness is busy.

845
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,710
Remember to remind him to drink

846
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,110
the calming tea these days.

847
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,590
Yes.

848
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,290
I've calculated everything,

849
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,330
but I never thought he was right before me.

850
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,400
You've got some skills,

851
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,230
daring to play such tricks

852
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,280
right under my nose.

853
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,920
If you dare to harm even a single hair

854
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,050
on my Master's body,

855
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,070
I'll risk my life to make you pay.

856
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,800
Don't worry,

857
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
I wouldn't bear to

858
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,240
damage this mortal body.

859
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,210
What do you mean?

860
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,020
What are you going to do?

861
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,880
Although a dragon's life is long,

862
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,000
it's ultimately not a human body.

863
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,030
With a body like Su Yishui's

864
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,030
in my possession,

865
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,620
why shouldn't I use it?

866
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,470
You...

867
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,380
You're planning to possess his body?

868
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,030
I thought

869
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,890
you were a kind and humble person.

870
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,880
I never expected that for the sake of extending your life,

871
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,630
you would sacrifice living people.

872
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,760
And now you're using evil magic to possess someone.

873
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,560
By doing this,

874
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,400
can you really face

875
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,930
the civilians who adore you

876
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,360
and your own conscience?

877
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,550
Why can't I?

878
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,110
I have done so much for the people

879
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,070
of the universe,

880
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,740
and made so many contributions to the court.

881
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,800
Now that I'm about to die,

882
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,640
why can't I

883
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,600
ask them to give a little back to me?

884
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,840
As long as I survive

885
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,360
and successfully ascend to the throne,

886
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,090
I will surely be a good emperor.

887
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,880
By then, free from the troubles of illness,

888
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,760
I can rule for thousands of years

889
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,250
and benefit even more people.

890
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,420
Isn't that better?

891
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,860
Do you really think

892
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,010
that after taking this evil path,

893
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,370
you'll still be the

894
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
benevolent ruler you think you are?

895
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,440
Do the people of the universe

896
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
really need someone like you

897
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,170
to rule for thousands of years?

898
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,380
You haven't changed a bit.

899
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,920
Even if your appearance has slightly changed,

900
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,060
you still won't say anything against your conscience.

901
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,710
But I don't blame you.

902
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,930
You've forgotten everything from the past.

903
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,960
Now, you're just

904
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,400
a 19-year-old girl.

905
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,550
You don't understand.

906
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,710
Those who achieve great things

907
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,910
shouldn't be bound by trivial matters.

908
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,800
Those who ascend to the throne

909
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,150
and become a ruler

910
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
all have

911
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,460
some blood on their hands.

912
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,370
I've really misjudged you.

913
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,400
Misjudged me?

914
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,510
You think that

915
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,170
your beloved Master Su Yishui

916
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,320
is so noble?

917
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,760
You don't remember,

918
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,000
so let me tell you.

919
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,670
Su Yishui

920
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,320
is the one who is

921
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,480
the Demon's child, the source of all evil.

922
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,920
He

923
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,440
is the one who

924
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,100
threatens all living beings!

925
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,240
What threatens all living beings

926
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,040
has always been the human heart.

927
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,150
He was born as the Demon's child,

928
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,400
controlled by those with ulterior motives

929
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,660
and the Spirit Spring.

930
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,150
But now you

931
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,230
are choosing to do these evil deeds willingly.

932
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,990
You're not surprised at all.

933
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,590
You already knew

934
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,230
that Su Yishui is the Demon's child.

935
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,030
That's right.

936
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,630
I know who he is

937
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,000
and I know who I am.

938
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,880
I can't remember

939
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,140
the past very clearly,

940
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,970
but I know myself well.

941
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,320
Back then, I must have known

942
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,510
that his true nature wasn't evil,

943
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,070
so I did everything I could

944
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,400
to help him separate from the Spirit Spring

945
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,280
and bring him back to the righteous path.

946
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,940
Similarly,

947
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,190
it must have been because I knew

948
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,590
that your nature was pure

949
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,850
that I chose to

950
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,810
help you and Prince Zong back then.

951
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,970
But in the end, I was wrong.

952
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,360
Since you already know

953
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,620
that you are Mu Qingge,

954
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,230
then you should know that

955
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,550
it was Su Yishui who caused your death back then.

956
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,360
But why

957
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
don't you hate him at all?

958
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,230
Just because he used

959
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,070
half of his Golden Core in remorse

960
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,470
to bring you back to life,

961
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
you can forgive him for everything?

962
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,880
I only know that

963
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,770
he treats me well now

964
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,670
and he's doing his best

965
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,300
to seal the Spirit Spring.

966
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,480
He's trying his hardest to be a good person.

967
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,080
Don't those who truly repent

968
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,370
deserve forgiveness?

969
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,880
Repentance?

970
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,020
Can repentance lead to forgiveness?

971
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,670
Can repentance

972
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,810
start everything anew?

973
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,440
Then I have regrets too.

974
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,360
I regret that back then,

975
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,190
even though you came to me first,

976
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,400
I still sent you to save

977
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,130
my ungrateful second brother.

978
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,700
If it weren't for that,

979
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,710
I wouldn't have pushed you

980
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,960
to Su Yishui's side.

981
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,230
But in the end,

982
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,670
what did I get?

983
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,630
What I got was the poison

984
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,870
my second brother secretly delivered.

985
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,480
What I got was

986
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,760
his attempt to seize the position of Crown Prince,

987
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,000
giving me this health

988
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,590
that's worse than death.
