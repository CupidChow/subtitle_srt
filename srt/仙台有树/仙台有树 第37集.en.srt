3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,479
That day in the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation,

4
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,810
I didn't try to make you perish into ashes.

5
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:57,759
Yu,

6
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,600
let's go.

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,310
I've told you that

8
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,770
you're not able to take him away.

9
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,910
In front of the demonic weapon Dun Tian gave me,

10
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,030
this little power is not enough.

11
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,110
Please come quickly!

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Escort His Highness back to

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
his palace for a rest now.

14
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,530
Summon the imperial physician to treat him with medicine.

[Cold Cloud Hall]

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,520
Look after him carefully.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Where is Dun Tian?

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,860
Your Highness,

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,090
he's not in the hall.

21
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,750
Then I'll just wait for him here.

22
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,800
If he knows that

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,840
I rescued Su Yu

24
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,200
from Mu Qingge's hands,

25
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,790
he'll surely trust me more, won't he?

26
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,080
Here.

27
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,150
Shui,

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,280
wake up now.

29
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,150
It's me.

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,530
Just some petty tricks.

31
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,270
Don't bother me here.

32
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,520
Are you and Su Yu

33
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,440
both under Dun Tian's control?

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,390
What a foolish mortal.

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,210
You think that I would want to go back?

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
So he has fallen so deeply into devilry?

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,250
Master, we're here.

40
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,840
Now that we're faced with a great enemy,

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,500
my strength alone is limited.

42
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,460
I have to rely on you all

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,520
to destroy Dun Tian's plot together.

44
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,040
Ranran,

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,910
if you need any help,

46
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,750
just tell us.

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Now we know that

48
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,480
in order to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

49
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,070
it requires the huge

50
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,839
spiritual channel power from the Heavenly Sects.

51
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,750
That was why he came up with

52
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,120
the method of using shadow people

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
to seize the spiritual channel.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
He made Su Yishui fall into devilry

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,320
because he wanted to take advantage of the Mortal-Demon Lord.

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,650
Then why does he want to keep an eye on Su Yu?

57
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,600
Su Yu is not a member of the Heavenly Sects.

58
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,270
What's the thing that Su Yu has

59
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,560
and is essential for

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,870
the Three Thousand Realms Tower?

61
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,730
Su Yu is the current Crown Prince.

62
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,830
Perhaps opening the Three Thousand Realms Tower

63
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,490
requires some worldly power.

64
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,370
But no matter what,

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,570
Su Yu must be

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,930
an important part of it.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,020
I will find a way to rescue him.

69
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,510
Besides,

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,550
where exactly is this tower?

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,270
Xi'er, Gao Cang, Bai Baishan,

72
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,720
go figure out the method

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,480
of eradicating the shadow people now.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Even if you have to search through all the records about strange creatures,

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,050
you must find it.

76
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,320
You have to be quick.

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
-Yes.
-Yes.
-Yes.

79
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,510
Go help them, too.

80
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,600
Also, help me keep a closer eye on

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,860
Mu Ranwu's movements.

82
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,740
She's now working for Dun Tian.

83
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,360
Okay.

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,950
I'll set off immediately

85
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,070
to investigate the conditions of opening the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

86
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,310
Only by figuring this out

87
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,040
can we take corresponding actions.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,720
But Master,

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,070
there's no way of asking about or investigating

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,510
the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

91
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,240
From what aspect are you going to start the investigation?

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Since there's no way of asking about it,

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
I have no choice but to consult the future.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,659
The future?

95
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,280
Back then, in Uncle Ye Xin's cabin,

96
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,890
I found the Heavenly Book.

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,800
After reading it,

98
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,159
I feared that the Heavenly Book might be used by villains,

99
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,770
so I hid it on Divine Dragon Island

100
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,900
and sealed it there.

101
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,080
As long as we can know the future first,

102
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,070
we'll certainly know

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,310
Dun Tian's next move.

104
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,080
No matter what he wants,

105
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,720
only by finding it first

106
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,430
can we stop him.

107
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,070
But prying into Heaven's secrets comes at a price.

108
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,480
Master,

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,070
are you really going to do this?

110
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,550
Dun Tian's spiritual power is immense,

111
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,280
and he acts with great caution.

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
To defeat him,

113
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,670
we can only take this risky move.

114
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,570
Alright.

115
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,490
Let's set off separately.

116
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,310
Let's keep in touch with the sound transmission talismans anytime.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,830
You're indeed the Mortal-Demon Lord.

118
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,870
You're really unlike ordinary mortals

119
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,200
with their limited vision and knowledge.

120
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,670
You've been keeping an eye on me.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,100
You took pains to summon me back here,

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,190
but you didn't make it clear

123
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,390
what your plan was.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,850
You're even wary of me constantly.

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,390
What exactly do you mean?

126
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,990
Back then, your cultivation was unparalleled.

127
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,800
Since you want to open the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,950
you would've done it long ago if you had been capable of it.

129
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,870
Now that you're making such a big plan,

130
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,000
it can only mean that

131
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,370
the conditions of opening the Three Thousand Realms Tower

132
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,040
haven't been fully

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,640
grasped by you even till now.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,390
And you

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,830
need my help.

136
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,010
Since you want me to help you,

137
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,270
shouldn't you show some sincerity?

138
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
You're right.

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,450
However,

140
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,640
you're only right about part of it.

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,510
To open the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

142
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,910
it's necessary to gather

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,270
the Child of the Human Emperor,

144
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,630
the Child of the Divine Dragon

145
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,310
and you,

146
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,510
the Child of the True Devil.

147
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,810
I have to offer the blood of the Three Children to the tower

148
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,920
and then use the massive spiritual channel

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,860
as the energy.

150
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,310
That's the only way to open the tower.

151
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,840
I've summoned you back here

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,260
not just to help myself

153
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,240
seize the Heavenly Sects' spiritual channel.

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,720
What's more, you're also

155
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,480
crucial to me.

156
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,890
Defying Heaven's will

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,560
is bound to be extremely risky.

158
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,220
We can't afford any mistakes.

159
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,120
Previously, you said that

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,270
you had selected the location for the tower's core.

161
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,159
Is it reliable?

162
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,600
There's no need to worry about it.

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,430
I have already made all the preparations.

164
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,390
Aren't you afraid that members of the Heavenly Sects

165
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,920
will find that place first?

166
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,220
No one will find that place.

167
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,460
However, there is one thing

168
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,950
which I'm quite worried about.

169
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,160
Back then, that girl found the Heavenly Book,

170
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,090
and she sealed it on Dragon Island.

171
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,000
The person monitoring the Wester Sect told me that

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
she had already flown towards Dragon Island.

173
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,070
If she pries into the secrets of the Heavenly Book successfully,

174
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,730
all our plans will be exposed.

175
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,550
It will be difficult for us to deal with it then.

176
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,680
If I ask you

177
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,480
to go destroy the Heavenly Book,

178
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,480
this time,

179
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,390
you won't fail, will you?

180
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Imperial physician, please take care.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,580
Bye.

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Fortunately, I have the talisman which Ranran gave me.

183
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,270
In this way,

184
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,620
others won't be able to recognize me.

185
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,950
Water.

186
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,800
Bring me some water!

187
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,300
Come over here now!

188
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,460
Your Highness.

189
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
What's your name?

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,750
The tea you served

191
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,150
suits my taste very well.

192
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,220
Your Highness.

193
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,120
My...

194
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
My name is Xueyan.

195
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,730
I'm a new palace maid here.

196
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,320
Help me to the window to take a look.

197
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
The wind is strong this year.

198
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,410
I wonder whether it'll also snow heavily

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,730
when the winter snow comes.

200
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,300
It is said that after a heavy snow,

201
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,200
it'll be a year with a good harvest.

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,550
Do you know

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,030
when the Three Thousand Realms Tower opens,

204
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,600
the world in your eyes

205
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
will be destroyed?

206
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,860
The people you claim to love

207
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,510
and the country you're trying to protect

208
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,600
will all perish because of

209
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,550
your desire.

210
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,910
If all of them disappear,

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
don't you think it'll be such a pity?

212
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
Xueyan.

213
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,600
Do you think I will be a wise ruler?

214
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,550
Be honest with me.

215
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,900
I hope that Your Highness can be a wise ruler.

216
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,240
When people are in a desperate situation,

217
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,700
mistakes are inevitable.

218
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,270
But Your Highness, if you want to be a wise ruler,

219
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,600
you will certainly be able to do it.

220
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,910
Where is he?

221
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,840
It's only been a short while, and he has disappeared.

222
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,080
Tell me where he is!

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,530
That's strange.

224
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
All this night, I didn't sense

225
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,340
any Heavenly people coming here.

226
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,000
Who has taken him away?

227
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,160
He found that place.

228
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,320
Shui, you're here.

229
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,080
Shui.

230
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,790
Did Dun Tian hurt you?

231
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,360
Come on. Let's go home.

232
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Is it fun to deceive me

233
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,910
with such a trick?

234
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,970
I was almost

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,380
fooled by your tricks.

236
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,280
I didn't expect that

237
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,380
you would be able to resist

238
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,910
till now with a trace of spiritual soul

239
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,960
inside the void.

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,130
You haven't turned into a devil at all.

241
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,250
If I hadn't done this,

242
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,960
I wouldn't have known the place

243
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,630
where you initiated the tower.

244
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,230
But you realized it too late.

245
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,670
I've already destroyed that place.

246
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,480
Dun Tian.

247
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,000
No matter how well you've hidden the tower's core,

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
it'll still be destroyed by me eventually.

249
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,700
Brother, why are you here?

250
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,230
As for that fake Su Xiaoxiao,

251
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,700
I've eliminated her, too.

252
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,540
The tower's core

253
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,140
was indeed destroyed by you!

254
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,520
So you've found out about everything?

255
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,520
That's interesting.

256
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,950
To find the tower's core,

257
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,050
you must have put in a lot of effort, right?

258
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,030
Every time we talked about the location of the tower's core,

259
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,000
you were always evasive

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
and tried to hide the truth.

261
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,300
Obviously, the tower's core is extremely crucial.

262
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,910
But I never saw you

263
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,670
taking any actions to guard it.

264
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,120
It indicated that

265
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,440
you already controlled this place completely and definitely.

266
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,550
And in this world, what place

267
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,670
do you know so well?

268
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,390
This reminded me of

269
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,320
the cabin where you lived as Ye Xin.

270
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,630
It was an exact replica of

271
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,630
the old home where you lived with your wife and daughter.

272
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,480
Since you refused to let go of your obsession

273
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,200
and wanted to look back upon everything,

274
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,330
I supposed it started from that place.

275
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,210
When I went to check the cabin,

276
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,360
there was nothing unusual on the surface,

277
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,960
but the barrier concealing spiritual power was underground.

278
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,080
When I uprooted and destroyed the cabin,

279
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
the huge spiritual channel

280
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,670
was hidden beneath it indeed.

281
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,200
I've destroyed that place.

282
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,630
Even if you can obtain

283
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,910
the Three Children in your plan,

284
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,200
there'll be no place for you to initiate the tower.

285
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,800
Moreover,

286
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,120
you can obtain

287
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,120
neither Su Yu nor me.

288
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,360
Su Yishui,

289
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,550
I didn't expect that though you have many

290
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,750
regrets in your life,

291
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,360
you would still refuse to join me in defying Heaven

292
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
and making amends for regrets, huh?

293
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,860
Only the incompetent people

294
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,460
would wish to turn back time.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,730
I've always only moved forward

296
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,220
without looking back.

297
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,870
Don't you want to go to a world

298
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,630
where you're not a devil's child

299
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,270
and haven't lost your beloved woman

300
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,910
and family?

301
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,950
As people journey through life,

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,790
they tend to lose many things

303
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,990
that they originally wanted to obtain.

304
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,280
But they might also gain many things

305
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,340
that they never thought they'd have.

306
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,040
I only want to move forward,

307
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,200
with no intention of changing even a bit of the current situation.

308
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,720
Fine.

309
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
That's interesting.

310
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,120
Do you really think that with your own power,

311
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,630
you can stop me?

312
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,240
You thought that the Soul-Cleansing Charm

313
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
only removed your memories.

314
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,870
The Falling Water in that charm

315
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,200
was actually my backup plan to subdue you.

316
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm not the only one working on this,

317
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,640
but Ranran is also about to reach Dragon Island.

318
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,440
As long as she reads the Heavenly Book,

319
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,680
she'll know your plan

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
and will surely stop you.

321
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,960
You were like this in your former life,

322
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
and you're still the same in this life.

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,170
She's the one

324
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,700
who has made you so weak

325
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,800
and foolish.

326
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,359
Now that

327
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,960
she has already become your weakness,

328
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
we must eliminate her immediately.

329
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,610
Mortal-Demon Lord,

330
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,590
destroy the Heavenly Book

331
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,720
and kill Xue Ranran

332
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,950
to forever eliminate

333
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,070
the future troubles for us.

334
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,180
[Cliff outside Dragon Island]

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm Xue Ranran from the Wester Sect! I'd like to meet the Dragon Goddess!

336
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,550
I'm Xue Ranran from the Wester Sect! I'd like to meet the Dragon Goddess!

337
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,220
Benefactor!

338
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,250
Benefactor, it's really you.

339
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,280
You're...

340
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,550
that little dragon from the capital?

341
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,070
Yes.

342
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,080
[Little Green Dragon, Qing Luo]

343
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,430
I've recovered from my injuries

344
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,720
and can take on human form now.

345
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,350
So you want to enter Dragon Island?

346
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,160
I have an urgent matter to discuss with the Dragon Goddess.

347
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,310
Mother Goddess has refused to see outsiders in recent years.

348
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,920
Even when those old fellows

349
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,750
from the Immortal Realm came here,

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,950
it was still useless.

351
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,310
If you want to see her,

352
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I'll figure out a way.

353
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
I'll take you to enter the island first.

354
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,210
[Dragon Island]

355
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,330
Let me check on my Mother Goddess first

356
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,860
to see how her mood is today.

357
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,640
Qing Luo!

358
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,940
I've been too lenient with you.

359
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,580
How dare you bring a mortal to Dragon Island without permission?

360
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,090
Mother Goddess,

361
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,060
she is not an ordinary mortal.

362
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,070
Previously, I was

363
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,880
confined in water by the imperial family of the mortal world.

364
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,410
She was the one who saved me.

365
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,690
In that case,

366
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,660
[Dragon Goddess]

367
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,590
I'll forgive you for trespassing on my island.

368
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,640
You cultivators from the mortal world come here

369
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,240
only to get magical treasures and spiritual medicine.

370
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,900
Just tell me

371
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,750
what you want.

372
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,370
Since you've done Qing Luo a favor,

373
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,050
I won't treat you badly.

374
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,250
I'm here not for treasures,

375
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,420
but to retrieve something.

376
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,820
You're here to retrieve something?

377
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,210
Yes.

378
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,130
20 years ago,

379
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,480
I hid an item from the Immortal Realm

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
on Dragon Island.

381
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,510
So you're the one who hid

382
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,510
the Heavenly Book on Dragon Island?

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,790
Do you know

384
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,270
how many times

385
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,830
people from the Immortal Realm have come to bother us about this?

386
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,270
How dare you!

387
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,310
Dragon Goddess, you're wise.

388
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,030
During the chaos of the Spirit Spring,

389
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,900
I had no choice but to borrow the Heavenly Book for a look.

390
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,640
To prevent this treasure

391
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,190
from causing turmoil in the mortal world again,

392
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,990
I had to hide it on Dragon Island.

393
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,700
What happened in the mortal world

394
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,640
was none of our Dragon Island's business.

395
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,680
How could you make us get involved in it?

396
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,400
Even though you're unwilling to accept it,

397
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,880
the Dragon Clan was already involved in it long ago.

398
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,680
Dragon Goddess, do you still remember Meng Zhang?

399
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,460
Meng Zhang descended to the mortal world

400
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,590
all because of the troubles caused by the Spirit Spring.

401
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,960
If you ignore this,

402
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,950
then I'm afraid the crisis this time

403
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,080
might be even more severe than before.

404
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,050
The Dragon Clan's victims

405
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
won't be limited to Meng Zhang anymore.

406
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,680
Fine.

407
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,750
If you want to read the Heavenly Book,

408
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
then just read it.

409
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,970
The Heavenly Book is inside it.

410
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,930
That crack...

411
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,640
Over these years,

412
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,170
the Immortal Realm kept sending people to bother us,

413
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,410
so I created

414
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
a spatial crack

415
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
and threw the Heavenly Book into it.

416
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,050
We finally had a few years of peace.

417
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,480
Go inside and retrieve it yourself.

418
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,080
Be careful with everything.

419
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,520
Mother Goddess.

420
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,980
My benefactor won't be in danger, will she?

421
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,680
That depends on whether

422
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,240
she can defeat Heaven's will.

423
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,110
I found you.

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,510
You...

425
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
actually managed to enter

426
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,980
the space created by the Dragon Goddess?

427
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,180
Since I've collaborated with Dun Tian,

428
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,270
in this world,

429
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,470
are there any places that I can't enter?

430
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
The Heavenly Book is over there.

431
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,810
Let's see which of us can get it first!

432
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,830
Mu Qingge.

433
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,520
20 years ago,

434
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,880
I was already able to domineer over everything.

435
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,590
Because of you,

436
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,270
I was sealed for many more years.

437
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,750
Now that I'm out,

438
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,010
we need to get even with each other properly.

439
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,920
We need to get even with each other for many things indeed.

440
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,400
But what I want to do the most now

441
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
is to pry into Dun Tian's plan

442
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,170
and then save Shui.

443
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,510
Let me borrow your demonic energy.

444
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,460
All the Three Children are gathered here.

445
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,830
The Three Thousand Realms Tower has been built.

446
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,110
As an oblation, this world

447
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,010
shall shatter now!

448
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,920
To build the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

449
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,640
the most important things are the Three Children.

450
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,350
Su Yu

451
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,650
is the Child of the Human Emperor,

452
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,550
while Shui is the devil's child.

453
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,450
Who exactly is the third child?

454
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
I'll make you disappear along with the Heavenly Book!

455
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,030
You seem to have forgotten that

456
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,690
destroying it is much easier than snatching it.

457
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,550
There's something I need to tell you.

458
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,960
Just now, when I borrowed your demonic energy,

459
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,160
my purpose was not only to break the Heavenly Book's seal

460
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,820
but also to send a message to the Dragon Goddess.

461
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,770
Glorious Divine Power.

462
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,170
The Azure Dragon subdues devils.

463
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,480
Fire-refined Dragon Crystal?

464
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,600
You knew I would come here?

465
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,720
That's right.

466
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,440
If you want to read the Heavenly Book,

467
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
then just read it.

468
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,270
I have one more request.

469
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,350
The person who has brought chaos to the world

470
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,550
fears that his plan will be exposed by the Heavenly Book.

471
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,350
So when I open the Heavenly Book,

472
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,340
he will definitely try to stop me.

473
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,270
I've heard that if the Gold Refining Fire

474
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,860
is integrated with Dragon Breath,

475
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,400
it can turn into

476
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
the Fire-refined Dragon Crystal that can destroy

477
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,080
all devils in each realm.

478
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,400
Dragon Goddess, please give me this treasure

479
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
to ensure the peace of the mortal world.

480
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,930
You once helped Meng Zhang and Qing Luo.

481
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,370
I will help you make

482
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,530
the Fire-refined Dragon Crystal.

483
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,110
However,

484
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,300
don't you want to stay alive anymore?

485
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,500
The Heavenly Book is made from dragon scales.

486
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,350
Although I'm not as far-sighted as the Heavenly Book,

487
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,750
I do have the ability to foresee the future.

488
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,020
From you,

489
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I've foreseen an inevitable death.

490
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,620
If you use the Fire-refined Dragon Crystal

491
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,280
to dispel his demonic energy,

492
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,090
you will be killed by him.

493
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,030
Even so,

494
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,440
there are some things that I have to do.

495
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,920
Shui.

496
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,880
I'm here to save you!

497
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,550
Xue Ranran.

498
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,640
You've been so scheming.

499
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,750
Do you think that I entered

500
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,270
this space alone?

501
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,340
Someone is trying to destroy the formation.

502
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
To finish such an important matter,

503
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,200
how can I not personally oversee it?

504
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,510
As long as I'm faster,

505
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,920
Shui can be saved.

506
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,480
Ranran.

507
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,110
Go! Leave now!

508
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,790
I've long hated that I can't completely get rid of Su Yishui

509
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,070
at the bottom of my heart.

510
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,270
Today, I'll kill you and dig out the Essence Core.

511
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,070
Then he will never appear again.

512
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,850
I'm just inches away from success.

513
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:19,880
No.

514
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,000
No way!

515
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,720
I can never...

516
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,440
You can still emerge from

517
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,570
the consciousness?

518
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,290
This time, I will destroy you completely!

519
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
Divine Dragon Light?

520
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,570
Dragon Goddess?

521
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,880

for your sake,

572
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,000
he would defy and change Heaven's will

573
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,510
and destroy his own Essence Core.

Qing Luo.

580
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,310

♫If you are safe, I would embrace death without a second thought♫

585
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,850
Can he really be saved?

586
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,390
He destroyed his own Essence Core.

587
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,830
His demonic energy was dispersed by the Fire-refined Dragon Crystal.

588
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,700
But without the protection of the Golden Core,

589
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,380
his internal meridians were also

590
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,120
severely damaged by the Fire-refined Dragon Crystal.

591
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,590
His foundation is completely gone.

592
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,240
His Spirit Root is totally broken.

593
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,860
Even if spiritual pills and power are infused into his body,

594
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,880
it would be like a stone sinking into the sea

595
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,080
and would be useless.

596
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,710
Is there really no other way?

597
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,480
If his Golden Core had still existed,

598
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
he could repair his Spirit Root

599
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,030
and meridians by himself.

600
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,750
But now,

601
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,720
no external forces

602
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,830
can enter his body.

603
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,110
I have half of his Golden Core inside my body.

604
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,440
I'll give it back to him.

605
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,390
Don't do that.

606
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,350
Since he used half of his Golden Core

607
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,300
to help you come back to life,

608
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,960
that Golden Core has already

609
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,180
turned into drops of spiritual power

610
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,440
and are scattered in your heart.

611
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,550
It's no longer a physical object.

612
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,680
Whether you take one or half of it

613
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,610
out of your body,

614
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,590
it will affect your entire body.

615
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,070
You'll perish in the end.

616
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,120
Ranran.

617
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,780
If something bad happens to you,

618
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,680
what he did today

619
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
will be in vain.

620
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,220
After his soul was cleansed,

621
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,440
he kept talking about getting back his Essence Core.

622
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,900
But in the end, for my sake,

623
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,320
he even sacrificed

624
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,540
his own Essence Core.

625
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,180
There must be another way.

626
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,930
Golden Core...

627
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,780
I once used a Golden Core to seal the Spirit Spring.

628
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,880
After I sealed the Spirit Spring in the netherworld,

629
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,360
the Golden Core was shattered and scattered in the netherworld.

630
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,830
I can collect all the fragments

631
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,030
and reassemble them.

632
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,400
The entrance to the netherworld

633
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,000
has been completely sealed.

634
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,040
It's not that easy to go back there.

635
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,300
There must be a way.

636
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,270
I'm going to give it a try.

637
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,720
Wait!

638
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,679
If you insist on going to the netherworld,

639
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,719
I have an idea.

640
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,880
When you were in the netherworld,

641
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,739
did you use any golden talismans?

642
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,620
Do you have

643
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,550
any of the same

644
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,280
golden talismans with you now?

645
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,230
Yes.

646
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,630
Do you

647
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,630
want to use

648
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,150
the remaining spiritual power of the golden talisman

649
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,400
to connect the netherworld and this world?

650
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,800
Yes.

651
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,880
The spiritual power of the golden talisman can connect the two worlds.

652
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,510
But, girl,

653
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,000
if I want to send you

654
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,230
over there completely,

655
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,550
my magical power won't be big enough to sustain it.

656
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,070
But...

657
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,179
But you've mastered the Soul Splitting Technique.

658
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,710
Sending a piece of your split soul there

659
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,760
might be worth a try.

660
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,320
No, no.

661
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
The split soul's spiritual power is weak.

662
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,440
What if the split soul encounters

663
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,670
demonic creatures and is torn apart in the netherworld?

664
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,550
He's right.

665
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,679
Let's forget about it then.

666
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,110
He even turned my inevitable

667
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,070
death around.

668
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,550
Now that I have a chance to save him,

669
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,800
I will never give up.

670
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,050
Let's begin.

671
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,150
This device will automatically search for

672
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,110
the locations of the Golden Core fragments.

673
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,730
You just need to hold this device

674
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,790
to get close to them and collect them.

675
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,810
There's a fragment nearby.

676
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,080
It's the last piece.

677
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,860
It's right in the depths of the netherworld.

678
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,400
Oh, no.

679
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,360
Her energy must have

680
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,710
been detected by the demonic creatures,

681
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,770
and she's now being attacked by them.

682
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,320
Girl, come back now!

683
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,420
Don't be reckless!

684
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,060
There's only one piece left.

685
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,760
I absolutely won't give up.

686
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,110
Since the power of Heaven and Earth can be borrowed,

687
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,110
why can't I borrow demonic energy?

688
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,070
Come on!

689
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,510
One wisp of qi

690
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,890
to break the galaxy!

691
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,030
Ranran!

692
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,120
The Golden Core...

693
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,440
I've collected it and brought it back.

694
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,640
Shui can be saved now.

695
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Is it okay now?

696
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,610
The Golden Core can't enter his heart.

697
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,170
It shouldn't be like this.

698
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,630
Unless...

699
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,090
he's rejecting

700
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,720
the Golden Core himself.

701
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,590
Let me check on it.

702
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,630
Indeed,

703
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,550
his spiritual heart is wavering.

704
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,740
He's not accepting the Golden Core.

705
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,710
Could it be that his demonic energy hasn't completely dissipated,

706
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,440
so he's being influenced by it?

707
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,510
That's not the reason.

708
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,710
His consciousness is in chaos.

709
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,310
He's trapped in a nightmare.

710
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,880
It's caused by something bothering his mind.

711
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,110
If the nightmare isn't removed, his spiritual heart will be destroyed.

712
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,480
The Golden Core surely can't enter his heart.

713
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,540
As the saying goes,

714
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,800
"When the skin is gone,

715
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,110
the hair on it won't exist, either."

716
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,320
All our efforts are in vain, aren't they?

717
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,880
Liang,

718
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,190
if this continues,

719
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm afraid he'll...

720
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,230
What if I enter the nightmare in his consciousness

721
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,560
and solve the problem bothering his mind?

722
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,760
I remember you've researched this before.

723
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,960
I have researched it,

724
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,000
but there's no successful precedent.

725
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,630
Do you know

726
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,070
what kind of problem might be bothering his mind?

727
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,880
Can you figure out

728
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,210
what kind of nightmare he has fallen into?

729
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,840
Human minds are complex.

730
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,640
In the vast sea of consciousness

731
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,560
and memories,

732
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,880
it's not an easy task to find the problem bothering his mind.

733
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,120
If you're not careful,

734
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,320
you might be dragged into

735
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,450
his nightmare, too.

736
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,030
Then I still have to give it a try.

737
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,000
If he dies,

738
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,710
you

739
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,260
won't survive, either.

740
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,540
I want to take a gamble.

741
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,210
I'm betting that

742
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,400
he won't let me die with him.

743
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,010
Alright.

744
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,710
Since you've made up your mind,

745
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,030
I can help you enter his dream.

746
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,780
But Su Yishui

747
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,300
can't hold on much longer.

748
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,110
You need to

749
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,150
break his nightmare

750
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,880
before this incense burns out.

751
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,410
Only then

752
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,810
can both of you be safe.

753
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,960
[Consonance Palace in Su Yishui's Dream]

754
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,930
I finally found it.

755
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,030
You betrayed your master and ancestors.

756
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,960
You deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces!

757
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Su Yishui.

758
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,110
Have you realized your mistakes?

759
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,760
Stop!

760
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,180
Master!

761
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,290
Su Yishui!

762
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,480
Why?

763
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,880
Why can't I open it?

764
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,110
Oh, no.

765
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,550
Once the nightmare energy completely swallows his dream realm,

766
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,080
he will never wake up again.

767
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
This incense will burn out soon.

768
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
If she doesn't come out now,

769
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,290
Mu will

770
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,480
trap herself inside.

771
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,110
Liang, figure out a way now.

772
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,080
Ranran, time is running out.

773
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,800
If you give up now,

774
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,440
I can still use all my life's energy

775
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,360
to protect you and bring you out.

776
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,710
But if we wait until the incense burns out completely,

777
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,510
I'm afraid...

778
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,360
I know.

779
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,940
I just don't know why

780
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,850
I can't enter his dream realm.

781
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,440
You can't enter his dream realm?

782
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,300
As far as I know,

783
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,070
only when the dream master

784
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,630
has set up a mental barrier around the dream realm

785
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,030
will this situation occur.

786
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,630
You need to break the dream master's mental defence first

787
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,030
before you can be accepted by his dream realm.

788
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,760
I can't stay in the dream realm for too long.

789
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,420
From now on,

790
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,430
you'll have to rely on yourself.

791
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,170
What exactly is your mental defence?

792
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,960
You betrayed your master and ancestors.

793
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,840
You deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces!

794
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Su Yishui.

795
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,140
Have you realized your mistakes?

796
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,070
It's all my fault.

797
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,190
If you had never met me,

798
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,000
you wouldn't have been hurt by me

799
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,030
again and again.

800
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,890
That's not true.

801
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,600
This is not your fault at all.

802
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,760
Without having met each other before,

803
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,560
even if we could avoid some pain,

804
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,610
what about those happy times?

805
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,540
Do you want to give them up too?

806
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,120
You have brought me

807
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,850
so much happiness in this life.

808
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,610
From the past

809
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,440
till now,

810
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,940
you've always been a indispensable ray

811
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,150
of light in my life.

812
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,620
Could it be that

813
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,290
light can break his mental defence?

814
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,510
Shui!
