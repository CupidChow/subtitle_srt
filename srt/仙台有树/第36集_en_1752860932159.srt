00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Martial Art & cossack

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,520
assist

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,520
I'm drunk from the dream, I miss you so much, you're the only one who's beautiful

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,520
If the night is too dark, I will fly all the way

5
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
To face the love and hate of the world

6
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,520
I only wish that by turning back time, I can experience both the right and the wrong

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Only when I've succeeded in love will I understand the true meaning

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,520
I thought I understood the meaning of the past, and was destined to be tamed by love

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,520
But I'm still fearless and never regret

10
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,520
When I see the falling flowers, I will still keep going

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,520
The love and hate of the world

12
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Episode 16

13
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Su Yishui is no longer here. What?

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Are you here to hide from this trick?

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Yao Chi, lend me your spirit energy!

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Xiao Shuai, I know that your past shortcomings have made you unstable, but you said that you must find the answer yourself.

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Don't let the demon trap your heart!

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Stop dreaming. You think you can still hold on for long?

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,520
You demon is just a normal person.

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
You have such a good body, don't you have any other advantages?

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
You're just a normal person.

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,520
You demon is just a normal person.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,520
You have such a good body, don't you have any other advantages?

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm different. I have a different sense of sense.

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,520
I used my own formation to create a needle.

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Now, if I can't wake you up, I will take you down and lock you up.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I will teach you a good lesson!

28
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
It's a pity.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Ling Quan's power is really strong.

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Even if we borrow the power of the Heavenly Emperor, it's hard to take him down.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Now that he has just entered the demon, he is already this difficult to deal with.

32
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,520
If Ling Quan is more used to this body, I'm afraid that no one can defeat him.

33
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Miss Xue, the purpose of his trip is to help the Nine Flower Sect.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
So what they need is the spirit energy.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
The power needed by the Three Thousand Bound Towers

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,520
now seems to be supported by the spirit energy of the five schools.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
I'm afraid that the five sects are all their targets.

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Leave! Leave!

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Report!

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Honorable Superior, one of the scouts who followed the headmaster has returned.

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Honorable Superior, one of the scouts who followed the headmaster has returned.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Hurry! Hurry and pass it to him!

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Honorable Superior!

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Greetings, Honorable Superior.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Did he regret it and not go far at all?

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Did he forget to go to the Chiyan Mountain?

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
The headmaster used the spirit energy talisman and didn't go south.

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
When he arrived at a village under the Qiuhan Mountain,

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
he rented a small house with a tree and a field and lived there.

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
He ran far away.

59
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
The weather is hard to face.

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
It shouldn't be very convenient in that village.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
He's used to living there.

62
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,520
The headmaster didn't do anything to hurt himself.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,520
He just sits in the yard and looks at the mountain and goes crazy.

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm just saying that his injury is not good. Why is he in a hurry to leave?

65
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Find a doctor who can treat his injury and heal his body.

66
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
But don't let him notice.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Yes.

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Wait.

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,520
He just looks at the mountain every day?

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
This is the life he wants?

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
He's not bored?

72
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
The villagers like guests. The headmaster will visit him.

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
He'll give him something to say and not refuse.

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
He'll smile and pass away in half a day.

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
He...

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
He'll smile?

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
He'll smile for ten times.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I don't remember what his smile was like.

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,520
He hasn't smiled in a long time in front of me.

80
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
No matter who you are, you are not allowed to invade my empty mountain.

81
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Your opponent is me.

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
You really came to fight against the mountain.

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
You're not afraid of me?

84
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,520
You really came to fight against the mountain.

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
You're really a man of your word.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Don't be so affectionate.

87
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Do you think I came for you?

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I came to find my little water.

89
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm in love with her.

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Where is she? Where am I?

91
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Go to the sky and land and go to the formation.

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
You're so fast.

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
You're such a demon.

94
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Ran Ran, thank you for today.

95
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Otherwise, my empty mountain sect will be ruined.

96
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
We need to take every step to know what she's going to do.

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
It's too passive.

98
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,520
We need to find a way to implement the Three Thousand Towers.

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,520
The first step to open the Three Thousand Towers

100
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
requires the power of the Five Great Xuan Gate.

101
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,520
You told me to leave this to you.

102
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
But you didn't make any progress.

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
You taught Mu Xing Ge a song.

104
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
It's hard to sing and dance.

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Is this girl so hard to kill?

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Or you didn't fully tame this body?

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Su Yu Shui is still alive.

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
She's as smart as a ghost.

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,520
You can't see her again and again.

110
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
You can't touch her.

111
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I've already devoured a soul-washed soul.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm not smart.

113
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Mu Xing Ge has the Golden Fire in his hand.

114
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
He's able to keep building up his skills.

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
He's lucky.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Once I'm fully used to this body,

117
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll make him die a happy death.

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
But remember,

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I'll be waiting.

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
If you can't make it,

121
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
you can try to get it.

122
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
There's a demon in the Demon Realm

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
called the Double-Demon.

124
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I've already brought out the Demon Omnid.

125
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
You can go with me and wake him up.

126
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Everything will be solved.

127
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
He's indeed the Demon Omnid of the Double-Demon.

128
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
If something happens to him,

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,520
the Xuan Gate will be in chaos.

130
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
He's just not out of the shell yet.

131
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,520
But you can use your pure demon aura

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
to help him wake him up.

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
You're telling the truth?

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Your Highness is willing to believe me

135
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
and order me to investigate Su Yi Shui's

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Chiyan Mountain's demon-slaying?

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I won't let you down.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
The Xuan Gate has been spread.

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
The only way to open the Three-Demon Towers

140
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,520
is to sacrifice everything in this world.

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Your Highness!

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
He didn't dare to tell me

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,520
that he's the Demon Omnid.

144
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
He's just a mere demon.

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
He didn't dare to tell me

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
that he's going to destroy everything here.

147
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Your Highness!

148
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Your Highness, your eyes...

149
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Since you can't see clearly,

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
why are you still concerned about

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
the outside world?

152
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
The outside world?

153
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
You're just trying to use the Demon Omnid

154
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
to get out of the Demon Realm,

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
hurt people, harm people,

156
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
and cause chaos among the people.

157
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
That's called the outside world.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
The only way to open the Three-Demon Towers

159
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
and destroy everything here

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
is to sacrifice everything.

161
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
You dare to hurt my people?

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
If you need anything in the future,

163
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
you can ask me directly.

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
You don't have to do this.

165
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
It's a big trouble.

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Leave.

167
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
But Your Highness...

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
It's not.

169
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
He still doesn't dare to touch me.

170
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I want to know now

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
how you're going to open

172
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
the Three-Demon Towers.

173
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
You already know, don't you?

174
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Is there no other way?

175
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Is there no other way?

176
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Or do you really want to destroy

177
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
everyone's life here?

178
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Everything?

179
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Your Highness,

180
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
if we open the Three-Demon Towers,

181
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
we can bring back

182
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
the Na's and Na's.

183
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Don't you think

184
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
such a magic

185
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
is worth nothing?

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Worth nothing?

187
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
It's worth a lot.

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Why didn't you tell me before?

189
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Because it's not important.

190
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Not important?

191
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
This is a piece

192
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
of the world.

193
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
A piece of the vast sky.

194
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
This is destroyed.

195
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
There are other things

196
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
to welcome you.

197
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Since you want to get what you want,

198
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
why do you care

199
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
about the time you've given up?

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Everything here is not empty.

202
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
They all exist on the fire.

203
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
And those people who trust me,

204
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
the people of my Qi,

205
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
they all die.

206
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
If I can

207
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
work hard to get the peace

208
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
and harmony of the border,

209
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
can I leave nothing behind?

210
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
No.

211
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
For you,

212
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
what's the difference between

213
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
the late and the late?

214
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Do you still want to

215
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
have a late name?

216
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Or do you mean

217
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
you're already soft-hearted?

218
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Don't forget

219
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
that I've been

220
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
practicing magic

221
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
for half a year.

222
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
After half a year,

223
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
your body

224
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
will be re-elected.

225
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
By then,

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
it will be even worse.

227
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay.

228
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Your Highness.

229
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
You still can't see me clearly.

230
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
But I forgot to tell you

231
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
that you won't be able to taste

232
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
or smell

233
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
the food

234
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
in a short time.

235
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Your touch will be weaker

236
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
and your hearing will be gone.

237
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
By then, you'll be like a dead body

238
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
lying on the bed.

239
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
You'll be dead

240
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
day and night.

241
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
By then, you'll miss

242
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
your healthy body

243
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
and your powerful power.

244
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
And your wish

245
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
that you can never make come true.

246
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Your Highness.

247
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Don't tell me you don't want

248
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
what I just said?

249
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Are you threatening me?

250
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
No.

251
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I don't dare.

252
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I just want to remind you

253
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
how to choose between

254
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
the light and the dark.

255
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Between yourself and the world,

256
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
you can only choose once.

257
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Are you going to

258
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
choose to be like a tiger

259
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
and live in hell?

260
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
You're so smart.

261
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
I don't believe you.

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
You don't want to resurrect the devil.

263
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
You're the real devil.

264
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
You have me

265
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
to persuade the bottom line.

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm afraid I'll even

267
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
lose myself.

268
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Instead,

269
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
instead of that day,

270
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
I'd rather

271
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
destroy everything you planned

272
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
and give myself a clean break.

273
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
How is it?

274
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Is this the last time

275
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
you've been dead?

276
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
How do you feel?

277
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You're playing tricks on me?

278
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I wouldn't dare.

279
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Shouldn't you be lucky

280
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
that I stopped your impulse

281
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
and let you live again?

282
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
You have to cherish the present.

283
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Despicable.

284
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Your Highness.

285
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
As long as you can achieve your dream,

286
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
be selfish,

287
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
despicable,

288
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
and so what?

289
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You're the son of the heavens.

290
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
How can you be so hurt

291
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
that you're so anxious to be the devil?

292
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Only when you open the Three Thousand Sects of the World,

293
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
can you escape from the mortal realm.

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
You've lost your ideal and revenge

295
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
that you can't do anything about.

296
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
You're the only one

297
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
who can do anything about it.

298
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
You've lost your ideal and revenge.

299
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
What?

300
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Uncle Ye Xing.

301
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I know that Ye Xing

302
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
will make everything right

303
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
in Chiyuan Mountain.

304
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I shouldn't have

305
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
taken the initiative.

306
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
But I really want to help Uncle Ye Xing.

307
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Wu,

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I don't hate people's greed.

309
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
After all,

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
it's the desire that created existence

311
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
and created the world of thousands.

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
But

313
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I hate the lies that break the old.

314
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Uncle Ye Xing, I was wrong.

315
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I just hope

316
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
that when you open the Three Thousand Sects of the World,

317
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
you can bring me with you.

318
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
I also want to go to that world.

319
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
A world without you.

320
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
A world without Mu Qingge.

321
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,520
A world that can lead the Xuan Sects.

322
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
You didn't affect

323
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
anything about Chiyuan Mountain.

324
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I don't blame you.

325
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
As long as you do

326
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
something that I don't have to do.

327
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
I'll do my best.

328
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Next,

329
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
I'll hide Su Yu

330
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
in a secret place

331
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
so that she can rest in peace.

332
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Rest well.

333
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Take good care of her.

334
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Don't let anything happen to her.

335
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I understand.

336
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I wonder how she is now.

337
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Still not good.

338
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Dun Tian used the formation

339
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
to separate Su Yishui.

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
She can't use her spiritual power to connect with her.

341
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
We have to think of another way.

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Master.

343
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Shisi.

344
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
We received this letter just now.

345
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
The letter says

346
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
that the evil spirits in the mountain of Qiuhan are in chaos.

347
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
We went to eliminate the evil spirits first.

348
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
We didn't attack the Xuan Sect,

349
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
but we attacked the people.

350
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Is this also one of Dun Tian's plans?

351
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I'll go and have a look.

352
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
There's something wrong with the West Mountain.

353
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Tell me when you have time.

354
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Okay.

355
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Chief.

356
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
I told you to take good care of her.

357
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Where is she now?

358
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Chief.

359
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Chief Tu received the help of the villagers

360
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
to go to the mountain to eliminate the evil spirits.

361
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
She hasn't returned to her home for two days.

362
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
The mountain is in a state of chaos.

363
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I looked for her all night last night.

364
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
I still haven't found her.

365
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Useless.

366
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
She will send a letter to eliminate the evil spirits.

367
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
She hasn't returned for two days.

368
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
What kind of evil spirits can live in this small mountain?

369
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
They can trap my people.

370
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Let's go.

371
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Run!

372
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Run!

373
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
There's a demon in the house!

374
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
There's a demon in the house!

375
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Help!

376
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Come out and talk.

377
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I don't have time to play with you.

378
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I only know that there are many evil spirits in this world.

379
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
This is the first time I've seen the size of both heads.

380
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
They are late!

381
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
The demon is so strong.

382
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
There's no such power in her.

383
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Tu Jiuyun.

384
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
These demons are really powerful.

385
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
The power of the sword and the arrow is so strong.

386
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Are you okay?

387
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Why are you here?

388
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I met the size of both heads.

389
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I thought you were in danger.

390
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
I called all the way to this mountain.

391
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I finally found you here.

392
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm fine.

393
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Don't worry.

394
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Don't go.

395
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
The evil spirit is poisonous.

396
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
You can't be careless.

397
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
It's better to be quiet than to be hurt.

398
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Come back with me.

399
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
What... What's going on?

400
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Wait.

401
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Don't move.

402
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
You're fake.

403
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm real.

404
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
You're fake.

405
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
You must kill Tu Jiuyun.

406
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
It's a mess.

407
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
It's a big mess.

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
She has told the elder about this.

409
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Bad news!

410
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Elder!

411
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
What happened?

412
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
That monster's blood can make another person look exactly the same.

413
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
What kind of demon is this?

414
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Elder!

415
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Elder!

416
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
You...

417
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
When?

418
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Even I was copied.

419
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
You're pretending to be me.

420
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I'm an empty mountain.

421
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
I never spread my power.

422
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
You all started to attack me.

423
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I knew it was real and fake at once.

424
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Elder Wen, I'm sorry.

425
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Even the skills are the same as mine.

426
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
If you can't tell the difference,

427
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I have an idea.

428
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
You're all fake.

429
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Be careful.

430
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Don't get caught by the blood.

431
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Yes.

432
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Elder Wen, you're the only one left.

433
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Leave.

434
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Yes.

435
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Don't leave tonight.

436
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Stay with me.

437
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Yuan'er,

438
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,520
you're the only one who can make me so moved.

439
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You're so shameless.

440
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
How dare you pretend to be me?

441
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm going to kill you.

442
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
You're a monster.

443
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
You're just pretending to be the head of the Xuan Sect.

444
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
You even dared to come to my Xuan Tian Sect.

445
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
You can't escape today.

446
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
You're so shameless.

447
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
You're so shameless.

448
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
You're so shameless.

449
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
You're so shameless.

450
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
You can't escape tonight.

451
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Guards, arrest him.

452
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Are you blind?

453
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
He's the one who made the fake goods.

454
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm the real one.

455
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Guards.

456
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
You can't tell apart clearly?

457
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Didn't you say you loved me for decades?

458
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
You just left for days,

459
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
and you don't even admit you love me?

460
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Yuan'er is my love.

461
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Now she's pregnant with my child.

462
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I don't even know her.

463
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,520
You're acting like you're not a man.

464
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,520
How dare you shout at me.

465
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,800
You're yelling.

466
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
You...

467
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,760
You're pregnant?

468
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,680
How could this happen?

469
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,560
It was that time.

470
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,320
I...

471
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Catch that monster!

472
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,680
Do you feel better now?

473
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,120
Don't be fooled by this monster.

474
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
It's fine if you can't tell.

475
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
But you were injured.

476
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,040
Now, you're with this monster.

477
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,080
You should be more careful.

478
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,840
Chief.

479
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,680
Don't touch their blood.

480
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
Don't be replaced by them.

481
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,040
Go.

482
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,760
Behave yourself.

483
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,760
You're a normal monster.

484
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,840
How dare you pretend to be a monster?

485
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,700
Just kill me like this,

486
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,660
let them know

487
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,280
the end of your disguise.

488
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,720
Please remember

489
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,580
what I have said.

490
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,360
Be careful of this monster!

491
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
How dare you talk nonsense when you're already dead!

492
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,120
It's not that easy for you to save yourself.

493
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,520
You...

494
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,200
Chief,

495
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,560
you're an

496
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,320
immors legitimized monster.

497
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,480
Has your debut guard doing the same?

498
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,000
Master.

499
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Yuan'er, don't be so angry.

500
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,040
Be careful of our child.

501
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I've been obsessed with cultivating immortality all my life.

502
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
I can die in Jiuhua.

503
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Very good.

504
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Master!

505
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Master!

506
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Don't come over!

507
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
What's going on?

508
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
This demon is a double-headed ghost.

509
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Once it's hit by its blood, it will die.

510
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Master!

511
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Don't come over!

512
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
What's going on?

513
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Once it's hit by its blood, it will die.

514
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Master!

515
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Master!

516
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Hurry up!

517
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
After I die,

518
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
you'll take over the sect

519
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
and find a way to eliminate the demon.

520
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Master!

521
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Master!

522
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Master!

523
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Let's go!

524
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Master!

525
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Master!

526
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Master!

527
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Now that the Jiuhua Sect has fallen,

528
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
other sects can only be used.

529
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,040
That ghost is indeed a demon.

530
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You're willing to let this demon out.

531
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,040
It seems that you're going to close this game.

532
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
If it wasn't for someone who had bewitched you,

533
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
I would have already finished this game.

534
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm talking about Mother.

535
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
You're still trying to fool me.

536
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Don't worry.

537
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
I know this trick well.

538
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm not interested in the stupid things

539
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
that she did in the past.

540
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
You're indeed a demon king.

541
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
You're very heartless.

542
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Look.

543
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
The royal seal on your body

544
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
has finally returned.

545
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
After we've taken all the spirit veins,

546
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
the three thousand worlds will recognize us

547
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
and we'll be free.

548
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Only the spirit veins?

549
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
What are you trying to say?

550
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
The spirit veins are just the energy of the tower.

551
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
If the tower's core is unstable,

552
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
it won't be able to take the energy

553
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
and will collapse sooner or later.

554
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
That's why,

555
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,040
we must find the most suitable position in this world

556
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
as the tower's core.

557
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Where is this place?

558
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Demon King is indeed smart.

559
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Don't worry.

560
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I've already found the best position.

561
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Master!

562
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Master!

563
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Master!

564
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Now, the sect has been occupied.

565
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Remember.

566
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
They only have the memories of Jin Yue Yu.

567
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
You can ask them about the past details

568
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,040
and then judge the person who lost the incense.

569
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Master!

570
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Master!

571
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Now, I'm badly injured.

572
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,040
I can only leave the Kongshan Sect to you.

573
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Master, hurry up.

574
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Sit down first.

575
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Yes.

576
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Sect Leader Hong!

577
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Hong Shan.

578
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I know that the situation now

579
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
cannot be trusted by anyone.

580
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
This is a letter from Miss Ran Ran.

581
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
She said that she has already found the way to defeat the enemy

582
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
and wants to sign the sect.

583
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Go to the West Mountain.

584
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
It's indeed Ran Ran's trick.

585
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
How can you prove that you are the real one?

586
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
You are drunk with the plum blossom and the cold.

587
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
What?

588
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
You are drunk with the plum blossom and the cold.

589
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
You are drunk with the plum blossom and the cold.

590
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
You are drunk with the moon and the moon tower.

591
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
You have been to the Moon Palace seven times.

592
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I have recorded all of these.

593
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
If it's not enough, I can still say...

594
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Enough!

595
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Let's settle down my master first

596
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
and then go to the West Mountain together.

597
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
It's動 ridiculous.

598
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Poisonous energy loss.

599
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,520
Vengeful

600
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,400
Yanran

601
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,600
seperti

602
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,440
Fang Polar

603
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,880
Mummy

604
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,600
Those bunch of evil old friends

605
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,760
dare even come here

606
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,280
Vengeful 통

607
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,200
Once we are background

608
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:03,760
we were

609
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Even this

610
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
You're a demon too!

611
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,960
Be careful!

612
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,520
What's going on?

613
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,360
There's a record in the Xuan Tian Sect.

614
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,520
Compared to the human body,

615
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,600
these scrolls are not broken.

616
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,760
They are hard to be verified.

617
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,480
They are replaced with fake ones.

618
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,800
The only broken one

619
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,680
is that under the sun,

620
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,000
there are no shadows in the people who fold the shadows.

621
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,720
That day, I went to Mount Qiuhan to remove the demon.

622
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,320
There's a demon!

623
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,280
There's a demon in front of us!

624
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Miss, don't go any further.

625
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,920
There are fierce demons in the mountain.

626
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
Run!

627
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,040
Uncle, I received your letter.

628
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
I came to remove the demon.

629
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,360
That's great!

630
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,800
Where is the demon?

631
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,520
It's over there, deep in the forest.

632
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,240
I found that they have no shadows.

633
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,320
That's why I remembered the record of the Xuan Tian Sect.

634
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,680
Dogs don't bite!

635
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,480
Thank you.

636
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,120
The Xuan Sect saved them.

637
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
However, they were too crafty.

638
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,560
and find out the way to get rid of them.

639
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,320
Before that,

640
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,320
you should rest in the West Mountain

641
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,480
and gather your strength

642
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,480
to wait for the return of the Mountain Gate.

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,720
Thank you, Ranran.

644
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,920
Last time, they failed to attack the Xuan Gate.

645
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,520
This time, they used the Zhe Ying people

646
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,720
to get the spiritual energy.

647
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,880
They must have done it for the Three Thousand Towers.

648
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,600
The enemy is in my name.

649
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I can't sit and wait.

650
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,440
We must find out

651
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,320
the source of the Three Thousand Towers as soon as possible.

652
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
But the Xuan Gate has been

653
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,760
investigated for a long time.

654
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,880
There is no record of it.

655
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,320
The Xuan Gate is not worth it.

656
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,600
But there is one person

657
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
who is afraid of knowing it.

658
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Let's do it this way.

659
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
The Ji clan's annual plan

660
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,760
is related to the state's safety.

661
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,520
There must be no mistake.

662
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,000
You go to the ancestral temple to prepare.

663
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,120
Yes.

664
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,320
I'll take my leave.

665
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,920
I'll be back soon.

666
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,840
Accompany them out.

667
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
Yes.

668
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,180
What a terrible omen.

669
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,380
Stop hypnotizing and LOL

670
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:29,780
You are probably 고�gew

671
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,300
The sword is too obvious

672
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,240
If you think it by coincidence

673
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,840
I can't let you down.

674
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,880
If anything happens to His Highness,

675
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,680
I won't be able to deal with it.

676
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,640
I used to be your sister.

677
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,960
Now I'm your father.

678
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
You've been trying to manage the two worlds.

679
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,840
But you've never really found your destiny.

680
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,840
Don't you think you're even more miserable?

681
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,440
You...

682
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,240
Where are you going to go?

683
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
You've been in the dark all night

684
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,240
and you've been in love with Mu Qingge for two hours.

685
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
But in Mu Qingge's heart,

686
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
there's only Su Yushui.

687
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
You have no place in her heart.

688
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,960
Get out!

689
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
Tell Dun Tian!

690
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
He's been keeping me in this palace for so long.

691
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,200
I must go to the Jizu tomorrow.

692
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,760
If he wants you to follow him,

693
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
wait outside the temple.

694
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Don't come in and disturb me.

695
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,800
Leave us.

696
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,920
Yes, sir!

697
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,760
This is Prince Wude's

698
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,060
way of showing affection and treating people.

699
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,600
He has always treated their life with starting anew.

700
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,120
Now, here it is amicably,

701
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,460
you three dead people,

702
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,360
escorting her from here.

703
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,760
Thank you, Father, somos.

704
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,720
I know you'll come back one day.

705
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,280
Xiao Yu, have you already

706
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
reached this point?

707
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,280
The doctor said

708
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,360
it won't take more than half a year.

709
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Don't worry.

710
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,640
I'll definitely practice the best medicine to save you.

711
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Qingge,

712
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Qingge,

713
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,840
you know I don't want to hear this.

714
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,400
You've been by my side for so many years.

715
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,280
Have you

716
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,160
ever loved me?

717
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,040
Whether it's Mu Qingge or Xue Ranran,

718
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,280
I've always regarded you as a friend and a confidant.

719
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I don't believe it.

720
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I don't believe it.

721
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,040
If I hadn't invited you to marry that white-eyed man,

722
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,600
you wouldn't have met Su Yishui

723
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,880
and you wouldn't have fallen in love with him.

724
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,760
If it hadn't been for that,

725
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,560
you wouldn't have met Su Yishui.

726
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,360
If it hadn't been for that,

727
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,200
if it hadn't been for that,

728
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
you would still have loved me.

729
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,200
Right?

730
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,520
Right?

731
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
Xiao Yu!

732
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,600
I won't just say that nothing has happened.

733
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,280
The more you look back, the more you'll realize.

734
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,160
Don't be too deep.

735
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,480
No!

736
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,560
I'll definitely go back and see

737
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,840
when the sky gives me this chance.

738
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,880
Even if we still miss each other,

739
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,960
I can still go to a new world.

740
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,480
A world where only you and I

741
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,920
have Su Yishui.

742
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
After the three thousand worlds come together,

743
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
there will be one.

744
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,080
It's you who loves me.

745
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,680
There will be one

746
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,120
where I can have everything that is perfect.

747
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,440
There is no perfect world.

748
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,240
Even if there is,

749
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,000
if it's someone else's,

750
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,040
is it worth it?

751
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,960
Xiao Yu,

752
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,520
the reason why people are different

753
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,800
is because of the difference in experience.

754
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,320
Even if you replace a perfect Su Yu,

755
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,040
the people around you don't have the same memories as you.

756
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,000
That body is just an empty shell.

757
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,400
In that kind of world,

758
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,400
you'll be even more lonely.

759
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,520
Besides, Xiao Yu,

760
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,520
do you know that

761
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,080
once the three thousand worlds come together,

762
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
the world in front of you will be ruined?

763
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,240
The people you love and protect

764
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,480
will all be gone

765
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,800
in your mind.

766
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,840
Xiao Yu,

767
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,920
in this world,

768
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,800
even if you have a lot of regrets,

769
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,280
you still have me,

770
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,560
and the company of a waste flower.

771
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,280
If all of this disappears,

772
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,600
won't it be a pity?

773
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,680
Xiao Yu,

774
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,640
come with me.

775
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,360
I'll try my best to save you.

776
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
I'm here.

777
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,200
Don't even think of taking Su Yu away.

778
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,040
Xiao Wu,

779
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,160
when you returned my spiritual power that day,

780
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,560
I've already decided that our grudges have been cleared.

781
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,160
I won't settle things with you.

782
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,480
You've missed out on the past life.

783
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,760
You're still obsessed with it.

784
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,280
If you make one mistake, you'll make another.

785
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,640
When will you turn back?

786
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,720
I'll make one mistake and then I'll make another.

787
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,440
I'll make one more mistake.

788
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,280
That day in the Jiugu Fortress,

789
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,560
I didn't let you destroy yourself.

790
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I'll make one mistake and then I'll make another.

791
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

792
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

793
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

794
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

795
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

796
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

797
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

798
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

799
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

800
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

801
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

802
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

803
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

804
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

805
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

806
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

807
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

808
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.

809
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
I'll make one more mistake and then I'll make another.
