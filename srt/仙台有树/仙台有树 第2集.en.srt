Tell me!

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,470
What's your name?

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,150
Who ordered you to come to

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,750
Tell me!

10
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,420
Tell me!

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,170
Tell me!

12
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,130
Take him to the Exorcising Tower tomorrow.

13
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,440
Let the sovereign interrogate him!

14
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,990
Yes!

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,190
You're so tough.

16
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,380

Alright, stop crying.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,740
Thank you, Master Mu,

22
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,730
for stepping in

23
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,980
and saving my son's life.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,040
You've done us a great favor.

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,210
I truly don't know how to repay such kindness.

26
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,160
I just returned Yu's favor.

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,240
It's no big deal.

28
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,470
Miss,

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,690
you're so good.

30

Brother,

31
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,680

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,530
Master Mu, please forgive him.

34
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,220
My son's just a little boy.

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,630
He spoke out of turn.

36

Why are you leaving so soon?

45

If something comes up,

just go to Mount Wester to find me.

Qingge.

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,350
I want to stay in the capital.

52
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,720
You've always loved lively places.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Mount Wester is indeed a bit boring.

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,159
Okay.

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,340
You can stay.

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,730
Take this jade whistle.

I'll come to your aid right away.

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,810
Then I'll take my leave.

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,440
Are you here to interrogate me, Sovereign?

61
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,630
You've suffered all night.

62
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
Have some water first.

63
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,510
Sovereign,

64
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,910
you're showing me mercy.

65
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
I already know everything.

66
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,310
No need for further interrogation.

67

Su Yishui,

68
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,480
how is

Prince Ping doing?

70
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,940
How did you…

71
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,310
You're so talented,

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,390
yet you've intentionally hidden your strength.

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,830
Every time you left the mountain for training,

74
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,690
you spent a few days in the capital.

75
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,340
You're such a special disciple.

76
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,040
I just needed to pay a bit of attention

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,560
to uncover the truth of your identity.

78
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,870
Sovereign,

79
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,220
I did that

80
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
only for cultivation.

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,950
Heavenly Sects can't get involved in mortal affairs.

82
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,409
They don't accept nobles.

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,180
That's why I hid my identity.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,630
At this point,

85
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,190
you don't need

86
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,920
to keep lying.

87
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,830
This is my token as the sovereign.

88
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
If you wish to go to the library,

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,240
just agree to one thing.

90
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,210
What is it?

91
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,100
As a Heavenly One,

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,720
I don't ask for much in life.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,780
Aside from completing cultivation,

94
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,040
all I wish for is a worthy successor.

95
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,920
From the day you came to Mount Eternal,

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,070
I've had the intention

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,930
to take you as my direct disciple.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,980
Unfortunately, you've hidden too much,

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,940
and I couldn't just expose you for no reason.

100
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,930
Now that we've put it on the table,

101
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,460
it's actually a good thing.

102
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,600
Yishui,

103
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,190
if you're willing to kneel down,

104
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,850
drip your blood onto the jade tablet,

105
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,980
and swear a soul oath

106
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,800
that you'll join my sect

107
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,960
and never betray it,

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,990
you can

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,270
take this token.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,220
From now on,

111
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,860
I'll teach you

112
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,860
all the Heavenly arts I know.

113
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,830
What do you say?

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,080
I hereby take a soul oath.

115
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,230
From today on,

116
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
I'll join your sect,

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
focus on cultivation, and never betray it.

118
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
Good boy.

119
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
You've made the soul oath.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
Serve me a cup of tea,

121
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,870
and you'll officially be my disciple.

122
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,210
Don't give up halfway.

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,600
You…

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,610
You tricked me!

125
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,870
So what?

126
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,870
I'll kill you!

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,750
You lost the bet and tried to back out.

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,280
I'm just claiming my wager.

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,890
Alright.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Hurry up and offer me the tea.

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,669
No way!

132
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,650
You'll offer me the tea as my disciple.

133
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,120
There's no escaping it.

134
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,550
Done.

135
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,680
From now on,

136
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,810
you're my disciple.

137
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,260
Shui,

138
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,280
let's go back to Mount Wester.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't waste your energy.

140
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,080
Blood in the jade tablet; soul bound to the sect.

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
It's useless.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,220
The demoness, Mu Qingge!

143
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,150
How dare you break into the prison?

144
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,390
Thank that old man Kaiyuan for me

145
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,080
for giving me

146
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,410
such a pretty disciple.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
Go report to Master!

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Yes.

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,780
Master, what should we do?

150
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,320
Senior Kaiyuan,

151
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,200
I knew something was wrong.

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,550
Su Cheng has always been upright.

153
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,050
How could he suddenly steal books?

154
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,440
It seems

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,030
he was forced by that demoness.

156
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,270
We should go to Mount Wester to rescue him right away.

157
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,270
But Su Cheng

158
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,410
has become

159
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,790
Mu Qingge's disciple.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,520
Whether he was forced

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
or not,

162
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,270
since he's made his choice,

163
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,560
he's no longer an Eternal.

164
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,410
So what reason do I have

165
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,430
to go to Mount Wester and demand him back?

166
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,270
Besides,

167
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,530
he did sneak into

168
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,150
the library,

169
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,910
breaking the sect's rules.

170
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
His life and death

171
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,120
are no longer our concern.

172
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,240
This is my Mount Wester.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,270
Master. Master. Master.

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,250
Master's back.

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,810
Master. Master. Master.

176
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,870
Master, you're finally back!

177
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,790
Why were you gone so long?

178
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,130
You're collecting pretty boys everywhere.

179
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,010
So dissolute.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,750
Master,

181
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120
who is this?

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,860
This is your new fellow disciple,

183
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,550
Su Yishui.

184
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,610
Master,

185
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,720
after being away so long,

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
you brought back a new disciple.

187
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,820
Come on.

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Let us give you a tour.

189
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,010
From now on,

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,200
we'll train together

191
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
under Master.

192
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,280
Let's go.

193
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,030
Mu Qingge!

194
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,780
You want to hurt people again?

195
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,750
I'll kill whoever dares

196
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,410
to touch me!

197
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,110
I'll seal your power for now.

198
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,850
Zeng Yi.

199

[Zeng Yi, disciple of Mu Qingge]

200
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes.

201
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,210
Take him to his room.

202
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,110
Junior Su,

203
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,370
I'm your 14th senior brother.

204
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,120
Come with me.

205
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,550
[Wang Suizhi, Mu Qingge's disciple]

206
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,610
Master.

207
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,670
I

208
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,910
read Junior Su's fortune.

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
It's not good.

210
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,480
He might even

211
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,280
drag you down.

212
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,550
Suizhi, I know you're good at reading fortunes,

213
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,480
but if I can

214
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,240
keep this talented little brat

215
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,480
here in Mount Wester,

216
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,550
wouldn't it make me

217
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,550
look impressive?

218
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,720
[Carefree Pavilion]

219
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,320
Well,

220
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,530
Master said

221
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,670
you've suffered internal injuries

222
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,600
which caused a lot of stagnant blood.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,030
She wants you to take those medicines

224
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,560
and then take a herbal bath.

225
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,440
Get lost!

226
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,610
I've been waiting for a long time.

227
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,460
Turns out you still haven't cleaned yourself up.

228
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,300
You vicious demoness,

229
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,500
I won't give in to you!

230
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,720
So you know I'm a demoness.

231
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,700
Then why aren't you behaving?

232
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,710
Just kill me already!

233
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,720
You're so handsome.

234
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,630
It would be a shame to kill you.

235
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,290
I'd rather keep you around just to look at.

236
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,670
Good.

237
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,030
This way,

238
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
I can see clearly

239
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,910
and get things done.

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,670
I knew it.

241
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,270
The Eternals tortured you,

242
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
but the wounds should be external

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
instead of internal.

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,730
So it's the Bone-Eroding Fire.

245
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Is it a punishment from Prince Ping?

246
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,030
Your face is so cold

247
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,490
it's practically frozen,

248
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,750
but there's still a trace of warmth inside.

249
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,430
You locked Second Young Master up and didn't kill him.

250
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,430
No wonder Prince Ping punished you.

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,070
Who are you?

252
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,550
Please don't kill me!

253
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,720
Sir, I beg you.

254
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,650
Don't come any closer.

255
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,520
I have longans.

256
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,350
Please, don't kill me. I beg you.

257
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
I'll give you all of it. Look.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,950
Dried longan!

259
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,200
It's really tasty. I'll give you all of it.

260
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Please don't kill me, okay?

261
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,120
Get up.

262
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,000
Come with me.

263
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,600
I sent you to Eternal Sect to learn immortal arts.

264
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,440
I told you to kill a kid, yet you lost him.

265
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,610
Yishui.

266
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,020
Whether what you said is true or not doesn't matter,

267
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,790
but there's one thing you need to remember:

268
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,730
if you can't carry out

269
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,060
my orders,

270
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,360
you'll wish you were dead.

271
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,720
Young Master,

272
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,950
sorry for the offense.

273
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,000
Am I right?

274
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,130
It's none of your business.

275
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,720
I helped you force the boiling blood out,

276
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,120
yet you're still so rude.

277
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,580
Take your clothes off.

278
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,040
Get changed.

279
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,360
Do you want to live here

280
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
covered in blood?

281
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,230
Stop looking at me like that.

282
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,890
You really think my disciples

283
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,950
are all my toy boys?

284
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,350
They're your disciples,

285
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,010
but none of them are powerful.

286
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,160
If they aren't toy boys, what are they?

287
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,760
Lyu Yuan excels in music.

288
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,440
Jiang Huaimu loves plants.

289
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Wang Suizhi can read fortunes.

290
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,470
Zeng Yi loves crafting magical tools.

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Each of my disciples

292
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,150
has their own unique talent,

293
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,080
but none are skilled in martial arts.

294
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,480
In other Heavenly Sects,

295
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,330
they'd be considered losers.

296
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,180
What a waste that would be.

297
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,100
I brought them to Mount Wester

298
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,360
and got a group

299
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,920
of interesting disciples.

300
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,560
Stop justifying yourself.

301
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,630
You received them

302
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,240
only because they're good-looking.

303
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,970
Once they become my disciples,

304
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,050
even if they cause a huge disaster,

305
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,120
I'll take responsibility for them.

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,220
So what's wrong with me

307
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,070
picking the pretty ones?

308
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,420
So everything you did before

309
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,680
was just to toy with me?

310
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,880
Shui.

311
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,650
Everything you did

312
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,710
was arranged by Prince Ping,

313
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,030
right?

314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
You're so talented.

315
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,750
Why settle to be a pawn?

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,520
Don't you think it's a waste?

317
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,140
How do you know I'm the pawn

318
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,880
and not the mastermind?

319
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,030
Before I become

320
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,070
the strongest,

321
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,290
there's always no choice.

322
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,480
But one day,

323
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,920
I'll have them

324
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,180
in the palm of my hands.

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,750
The obsession with becoming the strongest

326
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,480
will only bind you with desire.

327
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,350
In the end,

328
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,120
you won't even be able to control yourself.

329
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,440
That way,

330
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,970
you'll lose yourself easily.

331
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't lecture me

332
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,660
with pointless words.

333
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,480
Tell me.

334
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,780
Why do you insist on

335
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,030
taking me as your disciple?

336
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,490
Because for all these years,

337
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,590
you're the only one I've encountered

338
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,120
with the Five Spirit Roots.

339
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,660
You're the most suitable to be my successor.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,680
Second,

341
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,110
you have too much bloodlust.

342
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,800
If I hadn't met you, you could just stay that way.

343
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,720
But since I've met you,

344
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
I have to teach you properly.

345
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
If I leave you unchecked,

346
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,750
you'll end up killing indiscriminately

347
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,880
and wreaking havoc.

348
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,450
I've made it quite clear, haven't I?

349
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,960
Then let's see how long you can trap me

350
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,890
in Mount Wester.

351
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll kill those

352
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,690
I want to kill sooner or later.

353
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,000
I see.

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,690
That's easy.

355
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,500
I, Mu Qingge, sovereign of Wester Sect,

356
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,880
free my disciple, Su Yishui,

357
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,140
from power restraints

358
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,070
and the constraints

359
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,440
of the jade tablet.

360
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,190
He can try to take my life.

361
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,050
You want me to kill you?

362
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,190
Since you're so eager to kill,

363
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,510
then I'll bear that killing intent.

364
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,870
From now on,

365
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,680
you can use

366
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,310
all kinds of methods to kill me.

367
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,640
If you're not powerful enough

368
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,590
or lack skills,

369
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,020
I'll teach you.

370
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,170
As long as you kill me, your master,

371
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,770
you can break the soul oath

372
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,210
and leave Mount Wester.

373
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't regret it!

374
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Your sword moves are too direct.

375
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,640
Trying to kill me has a price.

376
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,830
Every failed attempt

377
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,240
comes with a punishment.

378
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,830
Killing me by injuring yourself?

379
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,160
Do you have a death wish?

380
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,220
I just want to kill you.

381
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
You brat,

382
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
you're cruel to others,

383
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,480
but even more so to yourself.

384
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,650
You need a different punishment.

385
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,060
What do you mean?

386
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,700
Play the qin for me.

387
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,190
What kind of punishment is this?

388
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,750
It's nothing for others,

389
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,810
but for you, it's a heavy punishment.

390
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,240
I won't play.

391
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,010
Then I'll take your sword.

392
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,340
From now on, you can only play the qin.

393
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,780
Being a qin player wouldn't be so bad.

394
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,670
This piece is called "Drunk Breeze."

395
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,750
Learn it for me.

396
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,480
It's a beautiful melody,

397
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,480
but you're playing it like a war song

398
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,340
that's full of blood and killing.

399
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Your temperament needs improving.

400
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,800
Come with me.

401
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,180
Mu Qingge.

402
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,340
What exactly do you want to do?

403
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,920
Killing intent needs to be suppressed.

404
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,950
Take care of

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
these little things.

406
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,780
If they lose one hair,

407
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,580
you'll play ten more qin pieces.

408
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,940
Is Junior Su

409
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,370
really going to play the qin all night?

410
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,200
He fed the rabbits and chickens

411
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,790
and played the qin all night.

412
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,920
Don't mess with him.

413
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,170
I made some sweets just for you.

414
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,890
I saw that you had

415
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,240
sea salt dried longans in your bag,

416
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,590
so I thought you might like it.

417
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,120
I tried making some for you.

418
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,930
Since you came here,

419
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,270
you've been beaten up seven times.

420
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,030
Here,

421
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,280
seven pieces as compensation.

422
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,930
Go ahead.

423
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,520
Try them.

424
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,400
What?

425
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
They're that bad?

426
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,440
I swear, I'll kill you!

427
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,220
[Uncle Ye Xin's residence, Puxin Village]

428
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,510
Qingge.

429
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,310
You promised to come back every three months

430
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,510
to visit Uncle Ye Xin.

431
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,710
You were almost late.

432
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,310
But didn't I make it just in time?

433
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,480
Where's Uncle Ye Xin?

434
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,000
Being late doesn't matter.

435
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,860
I'm happy enough

436
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,490
that you still remember me.

437
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,310
Chestnut cakes!

438
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,960
Years ago,

439
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
when I found you by the roadside,

440
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,950
you were both hungry

441
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,820
[Ye Xin, a cultivator]

442
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,170
and crying.

443
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,970
So many years have passed.

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,860
I can't believe

445
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,250
you've grown up so much.

446
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,110
Qingge,

447
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,130
I heard you took on a disciple.

448
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,350
What kind of person is he?

449
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,830
The youngest son of Prince Ping,

450
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,830
a rebellious lad.

451
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,010
I heard he's tough.

452
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,160
How do you plan to train him?

453
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920
First, I'll tame his killing intent.

454
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,910
Then, I'll teach him the true Heavenly arts

455
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,480
and help him form his Golden Core.

456
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,510
That way, the universe

457
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,110
will have another righteous immortal master.

458
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Taking him as your disciple

459
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,090
will involve the imperial family.

460
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you

461
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,860
favor Prince Ping?

462
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,110
Of course not.

463
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,850
Prince Ping is ruthless

464
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,010
and quite infamous.

465
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,540
On the contrary, Yu's father,

466
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,240
Prince Zong,

467
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
is a kind-hearted

468
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
and well-respected prince.

469
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,400
But I don't care about all that.

470
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,940
I felt like taking on a disciple, so I did.

471
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,590
But this could be troublesome.

472
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,720
A few days ago, I had your fortune read.

473
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,960
The reading showed

474
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,880
a rising sun,

475
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,480
but suddenly, dark clouds covered it.

476
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,310
Qingge,

477
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,050
now that your cultivation is complete,

478
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,680
you should follow the will of heaven

479
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,030
and ascend as soon as possible.

480
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,590
Taking Su Yishui as your disciple

481
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,400
might bring you trouble.

482
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,550
Thank you for the warning.

483
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,270
But even if there is trouble,

484
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,600
I'll face it as it comes.

485
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,370
Ascension

486
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,960
sounds so lonely.

487
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,720
The immortals up there

488
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
must be so bored.

489
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,400
I prefer to live freely in the mortal world.

490
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Eating, drinking, playing,

491
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,350
and having a rebellious disciple to train.

492
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,350
How interesting!

493
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,080
There are people I care about in the mortal world.

494
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,640
I can't bear to leave them.

495
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,070
Caring for others

496
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,940
sometimes becomes a burden.

497
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,710
If Su Yishui can't be changed,

498
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,590
what will you

499
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,550
do to him?

500
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,710
I'll have no choice

501
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,140
but to kill him myself.

502
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,880
I'm afraid you can't bring yourself

503
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,480
to do that.

504
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
You're always protective of those close to you.

505
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
You like

506
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,750
to take everyone under your protection.

507
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,200
But you need to understand that

508
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,350
everyone has their own fate.

509
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,030
Sometimes,

510
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,610
you can save a person

511
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,630
but can't change their fate.

512
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,960
Don't let yourself get caught up in it.

513
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,790
I won't.

514
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,170
Never mind.

515
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
I know,

516
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,240
sometimes

517
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,770
there's no convincing you.

518
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,590
I've been living here for so long.

519
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,850
I'm getting tired.

520
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,830
It's time to go out.

521
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,810
Where are you going?

522
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,400
I'll just wander around

523
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,580
and see

524
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,250
the interesting mortal world you mentioned.

525
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,510
Your power has greatly improved.

526
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,510
Hurry up and meditate to channel it.

527
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,380
Direct your power to the acupoints Bing Fen,

528
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,980
Xia Bai,

529
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,150
and Yao Yu.

530
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,270
What are you waiting for?

531
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,060
Do as I say.

532
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,750
When did you leave sword energy in my body?

533
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Your sword moves are too direct.

534
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,780
Focus.

535
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,220
The qin melody is the melody of the heart.

536
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,440
Align your spiritual power

537
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,370
with the rhythm of "Drunk Breeze."

538
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,840
Concentrate your power.

539
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,080
Alright.

540
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,880
Your power has solidified.

541
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,540
You've passed the final test.

542
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,640
When it's time,

543
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,300
you can form your Golden Core.

544
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,340
So, you previously punished me to...

545
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,980
The punishment isn't over yet.

546
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,740
Have a rest.

547
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,890
There's more to come tomorrow.

548
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,250
Father.

549
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,590
It's been so long.

550
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,770
If I hadn't

551
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,120
activated the Spirit Spring in your body,

552
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,200
you probably

553
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,580
wouldn't have come down the mountain to see me.

554
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,030
I didn't know

555
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,160
about your arrival.

556
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,030
Is that so?

557
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,910
Don't forget.

558
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,000
With the Spirit Spring

559
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,440
I injected into your body,

560
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,550
I can control you.

561
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,640
This Heavenly Bottle

562
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,400
is the container of the Spirit Spring.

563
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,890
With just a slight shake,

564
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,240
I can stir the Spirit Spring inside you,

565
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,920
causing you unbearable pain.

566
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,110
So,

567
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,070
don't try to play tricks on me.

568
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,650
I wouldn't dare.

569
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,190
Do you know

570
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,820
by switching to Wester Sect,

571
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,800
you've exposed your identity?

572
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,470
The Eternals have been asking me

573
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,560
why I messed with the Heavenly Sects.

574
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,920
I know.

575
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,000
Then why did you go to Mount Wester?

576
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,300
Mu Qingge has a fondness for pretty boys.

577
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,030
Don't tell me

578
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,210
you've been charmed by her.

579
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,770
I want to kill her every day,

580
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,270
but she tricked me

581
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,310
into taking a soul oath

582
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,770
and put me under her thumb.

583
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,750
What?

584
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,890
You really took a soul oath?

585
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,990
I thought

586
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,610
you were clever and cautious,

587
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,000
but it turns out you're an idiot!

588
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,460
I should've killed you when I had the chance!

589
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,880
Father, calm down.

590
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,430
I've come up with a plan.

591
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,160
What?

592
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,700
You're about to form your core?

593
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,720
Mu Qingge entered Mount Eternal

594
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,980
as if she owned that place.

595
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,380
After I learn her skills,

596
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,670
taking the demonic magic from Eternal Sect

597
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,930
will be a piece of cake.

598
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
Alright.

599
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,410
But remember this:

600
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,480
even though you took a soul oath

601
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,320
for Mu Qingge,

602
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,350
your life

603
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,750
is still in my hands.

604
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,840
Why did you bring me to the town?

605
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,650
You'll find out soon.

606
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Thank you, Immortal Master.

You're welcome.

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,440
Thank you, Immortal Master,

609
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,500
for saving my wife.

No trouble at all.

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,270
Thank you.

612
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,430
Thank you for finding my son.

Thank you.

Thank you, Immortal Master.

You're welcome.

Mu Qingge,

you're actually making money off of me.

Calm down.

You're not trying to make money.

You're helping people, right?

627
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,130
Can't fool you, huh?

628
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,480
There are countless people

629

in this universe who need help.

630
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,490
These small acts of kindness

631

are meaningless.

632
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,400
I'll just help as many people as I can.

633

It's better than doing nothing at all.

Besides,

635
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,330
I can make some money from it, can't I?

636

What?

637

You're helping people,

but why do the Heavenly Ones call you a demoness?

694
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,670
guarding this land.

695
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,530
It's so boring.

696
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,840
I finally found a chance to sneak out

697
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,170
and look for a playmate,

698
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
but you two messed things up.

699
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,970
You'll just stay here forever!

700
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,960
You're dead!

701
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,270
Celestial Ice Thorn?

702
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,010
You really showed no mercy.

703
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,370
This is a small place.

704
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
You can't escape.

705
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,080
Let us out.

706
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,250
You want to get out?

707
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,020
No problem.

708
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,190
But every inch of this Sealed Domain

709
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,550
is bound by the celestial contract.

710
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,590
Now that you're here,

711
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,800
you must abide by its rules.

712
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
This land of mine

713
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,470
requires two guardians.

714
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,880
The Immortal Realm's negligence

715
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,510
left me here alone for thousands of years.

716
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,030
Now that you three are here,

717
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,430
only two of you can leave.

718
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,300
One must stay.

719
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,630
That's nonsense!

720
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,040
Even if you kill me,

721
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,570
two of you

722
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,180
will still have to stay here.

723
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,440
The exit is over there.

724
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,510

He's not lying.

727
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,540
The celestial contract here

728
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,940
does indeed restrict us.

729
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,960
But I have an idea.

730
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,990
What is it?

731
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,080
Don't be afraid.

732
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:44,980
Go back home.

733
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,220
Where's the young lady just now?

734
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,910
She...

735
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,290
She stayed inside by herself.

736
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,280
You're out.

737
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,210
How did you manage that?

738
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,430
I tickled

739
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,880
that Earth Immortal until he couldn't stand it.

740
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,080
Then he admitted that

741
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,310
he opened the portal

742
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,020
with 300 years of cultivation

743
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,990
and came out to mess with people.

744
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,600
So I made him

745
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,840
use another 300 years of cultivation

746
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
to open the portal again.

747
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,690
It's not too bad.

748
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,590
I also got a piece of the priceless

Blood Chalcedony as an apology gift.

750
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,940
Were you worried about me?

751
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,340
I was just curious.

752
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,440
I got out

753
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,140
but brought a bit of trouble along with me.

754
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,390
What trouble?

755
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,160

This is the trouble I was talking about.

760
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,130
Once we left the Sealed Domain,

761
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,060
the Shadow Spell took effect again.

762
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,790
How do we break this damn thing?

763
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,320
We can only wait for it to break itself in four hours.
