Mr. Zeng is here.

206
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,260
It's been days since I've seen your face,

207
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,790
but it's still as annoying.

208
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,650
You've been practicing the Ice Lotus Technique so much

209
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,090
that you're turning into a lump of ice.

Zero warmth.

212
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,260
I called you here for something serious,

213
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,990
not to listen to your nonsense.

214
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,950
How is Master?

215
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,660
Master.

216
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,290
So this is how she looks like in this life.

217
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,470
You really

218
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,270
disguised her appearance well.

219
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,390
You sent a letter that

220
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,740
Master isn't feeling well

221
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,990
and might be in danger.

222
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,060
What's going on?

223
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,550
Her Reincarnation Fruit

224
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,470
fell too early,

225
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,400
so she was born

226
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,560
with a broken heart.

227
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,100
She can only survive by relying

228
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,050
on the Reincarnation Tree's

229
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,050
spiritual power.

230
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,390
If she's too far from the Tree,

231
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,850
her life will be in danger.

232
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,880
How could this happen?

233
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,950
She even showed signs of premature aging

234
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,660
after running

235
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,990
away from the mountain.

236
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,590
Something's off.

237
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,430
So I need you to

238
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,090
examine her with your energy.

239
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,630
This Mirror will take half an hour.

240
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,910
Once I got here,

241
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,770
I asked Yu Tong about everything.

242
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,140
Since you brought her to Mount Wester,

243
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,870
you've always been cold to her.

244
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,870
You even kept making her

245
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,660
go to intense places

246
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,620
like the Ice Lotus Pool or Westerly Valley.

247
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,640
I know you want to

248
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,390
cleanse her meridians quickly.

249
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,390
But without spiritual foundation,

250
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,700
how can she bear it?

251
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,220
Now, I'm her master

252
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,480
and she's my disciple.

253
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,510
How I discipline her

254
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,110
is up to me.

255
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,310
Besides,

256
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,780
my army's efforts were in vain

257
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,700
because she eradicated my techniques.

258
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,550
I'm already being

259
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,620
as gracious as I can.

260
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,660
I'm at my limit.

261
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,430
After so many years,

262
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,000
you've only become more stubborn.

263
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,450
Back then, Master knew

264
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,380
you were about to attain ascension

265
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,530
and so the Burning Curse

266
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,390
will be lifted.

267
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,000
If you really hate her,

268
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,830
why'd you give up your ascension

269
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,030
and half of your Golden Core to save her?

270
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,740
You even claimed it was

271
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,820
about saving

Wester Sect.

273
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,530
How ridiculous.

274
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,660
She did die because of me.

275
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,890
I owe her my life.

276
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,300
Once her heart is stable

277
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,050
and she's self-sufficient,

278
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,780
I'll make her leave right away.

279
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,349
Don't lie.

280
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,390
You were a difficult person a dozen years ago.

281
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,030
Now,

282
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,560
you're still as difficult.

283
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,450
Master put the Face-and-Heart Burning Curse on you

284
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,310
to cover up your Silencing Curse.

285
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,750
She hoped everything would end with her.

286
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,770
If you hadn't sincerely repented

287
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,050
and lived a life worse than death for 18 years,

288
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,630
I certainly wouldn't have forgiven you.

289
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,210
Don't expect any of the other disciples

290

to treat you kindly.

291
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I don't need that.

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,730
Master treated you so differently,

293
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,930
and even died for you,

294
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,860
yet you're still so stubborn.

295
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,190
What's the difference?

296
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,380

she believed was more suitable for this land.

308

But she still died because of me.

309
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,010
I will never be indebted to her.

It's the Soul-Devouring Lock.

314

It's the evil magic weapon

315

that is said to be able to absorb completely

316

others' spiritual power

317

get it inside her?

323
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,100
I thought

324
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,970
she was forced by the Heavenly

to do this.

I didn't expect it was all planned.

327
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,450
It seems she wanted to steal

328

Mu Qingge's spiritual power.

329
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,640
That's why she entered the formation and lost her life.

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,190
I'm afraid she won't be able to withstand it.

345
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,080
Mu Ranwu will be born

346
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,190
in three months.

347
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,940
Once she advances in the future,

348
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,490
as one rises, the other falls,

349
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,820
Master will surely die.

350
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,910
Then I'll just kill her.

351
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,810
No, you can't.

352
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,290
The Soul-Devouring Lock has bound the two of them

353
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,350
tightly together.

354
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,340
If she dies,

355
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,900
Master will die too.

356
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,340
Now we can only help Master

357
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,860
increase her spiritual power as quickly as possible.

358
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,390
Stabilize her heart first.

359
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,020
We'll figure out how to remove the lock later.

360
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,450
Fortunately, Master is blessed by heaven.

361
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,940
Although her Five Spirit Roots were taken,

362
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,560
it was a blessing in disguise.

363
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,050
It has been reborn as a Formless Spirit Root

364
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,910
through the Reincarnation Tree.

365
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,450
What are you going to do?

366
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,050
If it weren't for you,

367
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,050
how could Mu Ranwu possibly

368
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,050
have had the opportunity?

369
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,320
Master can't stay here.

370
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,570
I'm taking her back to my Tea Inscription Mountain.

371
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,430
Don't you dare!

372
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,770
I'm taking my Master away.

373
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,570
What right do you have to stop me?

374
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,420
If you keep Master here,

375
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,550
what good will it do?

376
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,770
When Master remembers all

377
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,010
in the future,

378
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,770
do you think she will forgive you

379
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,900
for the harm and betrayal

380
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,140
you have done to her?

381
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,420
No matter what she does to you

382
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,450
in the future,

383
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
you'll have to

384
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,210
bear the blood debt you owe alone.

385
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,140
If she doesn't forgive me, so be it.

386
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,890
I'll pay for her with my life.

387
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,450
If she wants to kill me,

388
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,530
I'll prepare the knife for her.

389
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,140
If she never wants to see me again,

390
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,370
I'll arrange everything for her

391
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,370
and send her away.

392
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,820
I swore that

393
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,420
I would protect her in this life,

394
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,010
and no one, including me,

395
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,730
could hurt her.

396
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,290
Moreover,

397
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,010
I still have some questions

398
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,410
that remain unanswered.

399
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,180
Back then, before the Heavenly siege,

400
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,530
she was already severely injured.

401
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,420
Who hurt her?

402
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,270
And at that time,

403
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,190
if she wanted to carry the Spirit Spring with her,

404
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,010
suppressing the Spirit Spring

405
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,140
wasn't impossible.

406
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,620
Why did she rush to seal it with the Golden Core

407
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,180
and hide it in Wangxiang Pass?

408
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,690
What exactly did she encounter?

409
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,210
There must be something behind this.

410
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,340
I must figure it out.

411
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,680
I must remove this Soul-Devouring Lock.

412
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,180
Work hard.

413
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,440
Complete the task I entrusted to you.

414
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,660
Then, you and I,

415
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,450
for all lifetimes,

416
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,180
shall never meet again.

417
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,310
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

418
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,100
Go look for the one who made you die

419
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,250
beyond recognition.

420
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,340
It's not my fault.

421
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,950
You don't remember anything?

422
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,620
To incorporate the Ice Lotus into your technique,

423
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,580
you must cultivate it without emotions.

424
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,310
Otherwise, when your seven emotions are disturbed,

425
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,970
the technique will backfire.

426
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,590
The Ice Lotus in your body

427
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,010
will turn into ice needles piercing into the bloodstream,

428
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,420
making you feel so painful

429
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,880
that you would rather die.

430
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,070
Don't be obsessive!

431
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,740
Disillusion!

432
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,620
What's wrong?

433
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,290
I can't even criticize you?

434
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,530
What's with your attitude?

435
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,180
You were the one who treated Master badly.

436
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Otherwise, would she have run away?

437
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,250
You're confused and can't figure out your own feelings.

438
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,710
Why are you torturing her?

439
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,490
Immortal Master, you've misunderstood.

440
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,550
Guardian has never done such things.

441
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,290
Actually,

442
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,200
Guardian is the one bearing everything.

443
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,530
It doesn't hurt much anymore.

444
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,140
Really?

445
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,010
Guardian has always

446
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,140
transferred her cultivation hardships

447
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,870
through immortal techniques.

448
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,700
He just never said anything.

449
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,580
There's no need to say anything to him.

450
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,100
I...

451
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,340
Look.

452
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,250
He's just

453
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,140
too arrogant.

454
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,100
I really don't know how you and Yu Chen

455
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,690
have endured it

456
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,620
all these years.

457
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,380
You're awake.

458
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,220
Go ahead and ask whatever you want.

459
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,340
Why did I become like that

460
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,800
after I left the mountain?

461
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,490
What does it have to do with this branch?

462
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,020
You were born prematurely,

463
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,030
weak from birth.

464
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,050
Even your heart,

465
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,910
the source of life, was unstable.

466
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,890
That's why your life was in danger.

467
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,690
So

468
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,340
your master brought back

469
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,010
this branch from the Reincarnation Tree

470
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,540
to connect with your heart,

471
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,690
providing you with life-sustaining spiritual power.

472
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,970
If you're too far from the branch,

473
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,100
the spiritual power will be insufficient,

474
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,830
and your life will be in danger.

475
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,820
Keeping you on the mountain to practice

476
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,950
was also to help stabilize your heart.

477
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,860
Ranran, don't be afraid.

478
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,290
I am

479
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,580
Mr. Zeng.

480
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,220
My name is

481
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,860
Zeng Yi.

482
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,350
With me here,

483
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
on this mountain,

484
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,690
no one can bully you.

485
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,760
Mr. Zeng.

486
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,430
What are you looking at?

487
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,650
There's no thunder here.

488
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,830
I mean

489
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,490
the weather today

490
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,380
is nice.

491
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,290
I see.

492
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,380
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

493
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,580
How could I have known

494
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,900
you would be so ridiculous

495
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,430
to think I wanted to eat you?

496
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,300
That's your problem.

497
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,830
You're always looking so fierce,

498
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,870
no wonder you scared Ranran away.

499
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,770
The misunderstanding earlier

500
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,660
was my fault.

501
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,080
But I still don't understand.

502
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,180
You and I met by chance.

503
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,820
Why are you taking such good care of me?

504
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,420
He owes it to someone else.

505
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,100
He should do this.

506
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,020
Owes it to someone else?

507
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,830
Could it be my parents?

508
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,050
No.

509
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,380
Then who is it?

510
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,490
Could it be Master's friend?

511
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,770
-Yes.
-No.

512
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,180
I understand.

513
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,920
If that's the case,

514
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,530
then thank you, Master,

515
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,730
for taking care of me.

516
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,310
You want to stay?

517
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,940
Since I can only survive

518
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,140
by staying and practicing on Mount Wester,

519
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,270
then I'll practice.

520
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,900
Although Master didn't make it clear today,

521
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,360
he has saved me many times.

522
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,950
I believe he won't harm me.

523
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,280
When he's ready to tell me,

524
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,410
it won't be too late.

525
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,100
Carry it with you from now on

526
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,830
to prevent any more accidents.

527
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,490
Although the Reincarnation Tree is good,

528
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,860
its spiritual power will eventually be depleted.

529
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,180
If you want to stay alive,

530
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,210
you still need to practice diligently.

531
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,010
I understand.

532
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,810
Oh, right.

533
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,330
I have something to confess.

534
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,450
When I came up the mountain before,

535
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,010
I had my own plan.

536
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,430
I wanted to save my friend.

537
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,620
Your friend?

538
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,140
It's a fragment of a spiritual soul.

539
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,350
It's been away from its owner for too long and is close to death.

540
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,620
It's said that only Liang Wumeng

541
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,450
can save it by using the Blood Chalcedony.

542
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,210
That's why

543
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,860
I took your Blood Chalcedony.

544
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,570
Just for this thing,

545
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,970
you're willing to risk your life?

546
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,770
Do you value your life so little?

547
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,640
What are you doing?

548
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,990
Mind your attitude.

549
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,740
Ranran has just recovered.

550
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,250
Since I can remember,

551
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,460
Ling Xiao has always protected me.

552
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,590
It's my most important friend.

553
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,660
I can't stand by and watch it die.

554
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,510
So you left the mountain

555
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,570
to save this spiritual soul.

556
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,770
What a bad fate!

557
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,290
Once I find Liang Wumeng

558
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,420
and save Ling Xiao,

559
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,450
I promise to focus on

560
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,110
cultivation on the mountain.

561
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,140
As for your Blood Chalcedony,

562
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,010
I'll find a new one

563
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,210
to replace it for you.

564
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,940
Is that okay?

565
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,610
[Liang Wumeng's residence]

566
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,390
This is

567
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,950
Liang Wumeng's residence?

568
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,770
That's right.

569
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,690
Sorry.

570
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,140
Master is currently in seclusion

571
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,680
and cannot receive visitors.

572
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,790
Then when will he

573
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,770
come out of seclusion?

574
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,250
Master is advancing in power

575
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,530
at a critical moment.

576
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,790
Two years, at most.

577
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,880
One year, at least.

578
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,450
It all depends.

579
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,050
One or two years?

580
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,140
Can it hold on

581
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,140
until then?

582
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,010
If there is more Blood Chalcedony

583
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,900
to nourish this spiritual soul,

584
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,730
it might last until Master comes out of seclusion.

585
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,450
Blood Chalcedony

586
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,140
is a rare spiritual treasure in the world.

587
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,900
Finding one piece is already difficult.

588
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,690
Where can I get

589
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,020
more Blood Chalcedony?

590
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,940
The key to Blood Chalcedony's ability

591
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,490
to nourish spiritual souls

592
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,340
is that it can simultaneously integrate

593
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,620
the five spiritual energies.

594
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,940
However,

595
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,340
in the cultivation world, there's another

596
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,900
extremely rare thing,

597
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,340
namely Formless Spirit Root.

598
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,320
It can encompass all five Spirit Roots,

599
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,940
cultivating one to gain five.

600
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,570
It's even better at nourishing spiritual souls than Blood Chalcedony.

601
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,240
The Formless Spirit Root is that powerful?

602
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,900
It can even nourish spiritual souls?

603
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,860
However,

604
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,830
Blood Chalcedony is hard to find,

605
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,570
and the Formless Spirit Root is even rarer.

606
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,900
I wish you good luck.

607
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,170
Farewell.

608
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,570
Master,

609
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,300
Ling Xiao can be saved!

610
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,900
[Auspicious and peaceful]

611
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,780
It's all happening.

612
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,880
It turns out that your Formless Spirit Root

613
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,810
can also nourish spiritual souls.

614
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,530
I've connected Ling Xiao

615
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,190
to your Formless Spirit Root.

616
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,300
From now on, you can use your Spirit Root

617
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,030
to nourish the spiritual soul.

618
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,630
In this way,

619
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,740
even if we can't find the soul owner right away,

620
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,780
it won't be a big problem.

621
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,530
If you want it to regain vitality,

622
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,130
you need to improve your cultivation quickly.

623
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,420
While waiting for Liang Wumeng

624
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,820
to come out of seclusion,

625
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,700
Ranran, you should start cultivating first.

626
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,500
But remember,

627
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,380
don't let others know about

628
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,820
your Formless Spirit Root.

629
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,300
I will definitely practice diligently,

630
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,570
whether I'm baked by the scorching sun,

631
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,450
soaked in ice water,

632
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,850
or starving from fasting.

633
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,420
I will take it all seriously.

634
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,280
How can that be?

635
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,510
How can we let you...

636
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,910
As a master,

637
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,090
how can you be so cruel?

638
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,010
That's a pretty

639
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,620
extreme way of training.

640
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,220
Back then, Master

641
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,820
taught me the same way, didn't she?

642
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,780
Nonsense!

643
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,410
Master never tortured you!

644
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,420
It was because you were so unruly

645
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,340
that Master had no choice

646
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,500
but to use both soft and hard approaches.

647
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,940
Do you dare say her teachings

648
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,900
weren't thoughtful enough

649
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,100
or effective enough?

650
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,790
Look,

651
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,530
being a master is not that easy.

652
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,260
You need to pay attention to the methods.

653
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,610
You're still far from it.

654
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,010
Think it over carefully.

655
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,570
It seems that

656
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,700
the relationship between Master and Founder Mu

657
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,170
is not as bad as

658
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,570
it is said to be.

659
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,700
So,

660
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,300
your guidance for Ranran

661
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,190
should follow

662
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,570
our Mount Wester's principles:

663
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,010
teach according to one's aptitude,

664
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,540
and prioritize happiness.

665
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,500
In this world,

666
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,090
is there really such a thing as happy immortal cultivation?

667
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,690
Of course.

668
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,050
At Mount Wester,

669
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,860
as long as you don't violate the sect rules,

670
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,120
no one can control you.

671
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,420
Really?

672
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,700
As long as you can complete your tasks,

673
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,300
everything else is up to you.

674
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,710
Thank you, Master.

675
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,180
I promise I won't be lazy.

676
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,260
However,

677
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,050
I only want to practice until I can protect myself

678
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,130
and my friends.

679
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,970
As for attaining ascension and becoming an immortal,

680
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,450
or advancing to become a great cultivator,

681
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,580
I'm not interested.

682
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,780
I still prefer

683
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,110
the lively mortal life.

684
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,380
Is that okay?

685
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,570
Great!

686
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,170
I'll go make some delicious food right away.

687
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,970
Master,

688
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,230
you can try my cooking.

689
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,970
Your body is in such a condition,

690
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,550
and you're still thinking about food?

691
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,550
Even if it's

692
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,420
the last day of life,

693
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,970
one should still eat and drink well.

694
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,970
I, Xue Ranran,

695
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,420
have always believed in

696
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
being low-key in life

697
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,340
but high-key in dining.

698
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,170
Only in this way

699
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,430
can I live up to my life.

700
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,380
Master,

701
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
what do you think?

702
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,580
Do as you please.

703
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,320
But I've already abstained from grains.

704
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,260
These worldly things

705
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,320
don't interest me.

706
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,380
Don't count me in.

707
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,090
He won't eat,

708
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,620
but I didn't say I wouldn't.

709
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,970
He is

710
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,350
such a killjoy.

711
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,630
Just ignore him.

712
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,530
Mr. Zeng,

713
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,980
we met too late.

714
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,780
No.

715
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,610
It's not late.

716
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,470
Not late at all.

717
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,780
Then I'll go cooking.

718
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,740
After Liang Wumeng comes out of seclusion,

719
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,420
Ranran

720
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,950
will remember everything.

721
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,990
You might not be able

722
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,370
to get your soul back.

723
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,380
That's just a pretext

724
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,710
to urge her to practice.

725
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,020
I didn't expect her to give it back.

726
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,170
But without this fragment of soul,

727
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,010
you won't be able to repair your Golden Core.

728
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,700
You'll be forever cut off from the Transcendence Realm,

729
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,170
only able to maintain your power through the Ice Lotus Technique.

730
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,170
Isn't that a pity?

731
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,219
Su Yishui

732
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,820
has successfully brought back Xue Ranran.

733
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,560
Wei Jiu is still not satisfied

734
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,350
and has sent disciples to search everywhere.

735
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,449
It seems

736
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,540
he won't give up easily.

737
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,050
Just as you predicted,

738
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,580
only Xue Ranran

739
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,650
can stir up this storm.

740
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,780
The day we're waiting for

741
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,170
isn't far off.

742
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,310
[Mount Wester]

743
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,090
Ranran,

744
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,070
I didn't expect that this time

745
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,380
you'd run down the mountain and come back,

746
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:44,960
and even make Master

747
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,820
break our fast.

748
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,300
You can still laugh about it?

749
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
Listen.

750
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,699
It doesn't matter

751
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,130
if you give up halfway yourself,

752
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,860
but don't ruin our reputation.

753
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,250
You're right.

754
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
It was my fault.

755
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,450
I'll make some delicious food

756
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,910
to apologize to everyone.

757
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,020
But eating

758
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,910
will amplify the desire for food,

759
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,700
which is not good for self-cultivation.

760
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,220
In this world,

761
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,950
how can one be without desires?

762
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,740
Even cultivating to attain ascension

763
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,800
is a kind of desire.

764
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,380
Mr. Zeng.

765
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,230
Don't be so formal.

766
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,610
Rather than being pretentious

767
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,740
and forcing growth,

768
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,940
it's better to follow one's nature

769
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,090
and guide accordingly.

770
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,610
This is the true principle

771
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,050
of our Wester Sect.

772
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,090
Yes. You're right.

773
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,300
Ranran.

774
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,270
This is

775
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
an invulnerable golden silk armor.

776
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,540
Thank you for the gift, Mr. Zeng.

777
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,250
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

778
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,220
-Thank you, Mr. Zeng.
-Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

779
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,020
It's nothing.

780
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,680
Don't mention it.

781
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,280
Sit down.

782
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,490
Sit. Sit down.

783
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,450
Sit.

784
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,870
Today,

785
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,630
I finally get to meet Mr. Zeng.

786
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,450
Your hands

787
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,780
are truly skilled.

788
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,650
That's all in the past.

789
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,940
Things are different now.

790
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,130
Rumour has it that

791
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,300
you hurt your hand

792
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,530
because of Founder Mu.

793
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,450
Is that true?

794
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,750
Well, it's just a rumor.

795
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,270
As rumors spread,

796
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,490
they will go unheard,

797
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:31,970
right?

798
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,460
The demoness is dead.

799
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,860
Wester Sect has been destroyed.

800
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,490
What are you still stubbornly holding onto?

801
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,250
Why not join our Qingcheng Sect instead?

802
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,380
At least you'll have some protection.

803
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,260
That sounds nice,

804
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,170
but aren't you just trying to kidnap me

805
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,970
to help you make spiritual weapons?

806
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,670
I will never betray Wester Sect.

807
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,700
I won't betray my master.

808
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,090
Fine.

809
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,300
Since you refuse to

810
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,650
serve us with your hands,

811
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,980
we won't let other Heavenly Sects benefit from them either.

812
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,470
Later on,

813
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,900
thankfully, your master

814
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,360
arrived in time to save me.

815
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,730
It's all in the past.

816
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,880
Hurry. The food is getting cold.

817
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,390
Eat quickly.

818
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,390
Eat.

819
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,020
Alright.

820
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,250
Let's try Ranran's cooking.

821
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,420
-Ms. Yu Tong.
-Ms. Yu Tong.

822
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,570
Guardian specifically sent me down the mountain

823
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,490
to buy some wine.

824
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,420
He was afraid that you wouldn't have enough to drink,

825
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,150
so he asked me to bring it to you.

826
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,600
Yu Tong, you've come at the right time.

827
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,460
Come on, sit down with us

828
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,920
and try Ranran's cooking.

829
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,530
Come on.

830
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,470
Sit down. Let's eat together.

831
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,630
Sit. Ms. Yu Tong.

832
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,950
Let's eat together.

833
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,490
It smells so good.

834
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,010
It's been too long

835
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,340
since I smelled such delicious food here.

836
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,490
Why don't we call Mr. Yu Chen

837
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,220
to join us?

838
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,050
No need.

839
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,010
My brother has always looked up to Guardian

840
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,870
as a role model.

841
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,680
Guardian abstains from food,

842
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,940
so he won't eat either.

843
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,260
Look.

844
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,320
Poor Yu Chen.

845
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,220
Of all people to imitate,

846
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,420
he had to choose Su, that cold fish.

847
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,170
It's a pity that

848
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,700
he can't try Ranran's good cooking,

849
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,380
right?

850
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,340
Just leave them alone.

851
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,070
Let's drink.

852
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,490
Okay.

853
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,820
Everyone, please try my cooking.

854
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,610
Alright.

855
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,220
Here! Xi'er.

856
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,460
It's delicious.

857
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,940
I thought

858
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,300
when you came back to life,

859
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,130
you would immediately reclaim everything

860
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,990
and all grudges would be settled.

861
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,420
I never expected

862
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,650
we would have a chance to be together like this.

863
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,170
When you know the truth,

864
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,510
will you do

865
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,700
as you said,

866
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,880
for all lifetimes,

867
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,060
you and I shall never meet again?

868
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,100
I have another specialty dish.

869
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,570
Wait for me.

870
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,370
Just a moment.

871
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,620
There are enough dishes!

872
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,160
Master

873
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,440
looks so lonely.
