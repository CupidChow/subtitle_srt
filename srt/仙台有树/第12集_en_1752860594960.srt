1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I will never regret

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Wearing a beautiful dress, we will drink to the end of the world

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,400
I miss you, even if you are crying

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,400
If the night is too dark, I will follow you

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,000
To face the love and hate of the world

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,200
This distance turns a few times

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,000
The distance between the north and the west

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Succeeded in reincarnation, only then do I understand the true value

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Like a white spring, destined to be tainted by love

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,400
But I still don't regret it

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,800
Waiting for the flowers to bloom

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Everyone is a pair, and I slowly understand you

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,800
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Episode 16

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did I...

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The water is clear, you can go now.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,000
Xiao Shui, actually, the two of us are not meant to be here.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,800
You really dare to treat yourself as the owner of this place.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Brother Qing, how are you?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
Xiao Yue, Xiao Shui has already helped me get the water.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,200
You should have told me that this person has occupied the West Mountain for over a decade

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
and you are no longer here.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
How can you trust this person?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Xiao Yue, it's Guo Jingqian.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Why do you have to keep asking Xiao Shui?

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Why are you so stubborn?

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
The matter is over, you should go.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
Xiao Yue, you are not the one who should be here.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
Hurry and go.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Mr. Yu, why are you here?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Ran Ran.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Ran Ran, Ran Ran.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Ran Ran, do you know the Crown Prince?

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
What Crown Prince?

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,600
You are saying that Mr. Yu is the Crown Prince?

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Then every year when he goes to the foot of the Mount, he is waiting for the Immortal Mu?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,000
I was just saying that the Crown Prince is here to see Immortal Mu.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,400
This is very similar to the rumor that I heard before.

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
What rumor?

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
You are selling the temple again?

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,200
It is said that Master was in love with the Immortal Master.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
But in the heart of Immortal Mu, there is only the Crown Prince,

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
that is, the Crown Prince.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
He is the one who is in love with each other.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Master is so loving and hateful.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
He is the most loyal and killest.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Master is not someone who can be destroyed by love and hatred.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,600
Stop wearing these nonsense.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Exactly.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
You are so loyal.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Let's go. Let's go practice.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Ran Ran, I saw you talking about this Mr. Yu.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
He was so happy and happy.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,600
I was afraid that he would be so close to the Grand Master.

56
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Now that you look fine, I am at ease.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go practice.

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
So weird.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Why am I not as happy as before when I see him?

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Although I am willing to,

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr. Yu is my favorite.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Yu...

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Your Highness, Immortal Mu, please have some tea.

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Sorry. I hid my identity in the outside.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
You can call me Mr. Yu from now on.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
No need to call me that.

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
How did you two meet?

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Because of his cooking skills,

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
you must have tasted his cooking wine.

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,800
You are not allowed to drink in the West Mountain.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Ran Ran, some people are so self-righteous.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I am just a friend. Why should I care about him?

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Why did you come to the West Mountain?

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Something happened.

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,600
It's all thanks to Master for saving me.

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,600
You have an appointment. Don't be fooled.

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,200
If you are bullied, you can tell me.

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,200
When did you come to the West Mountain?

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
For me, the West Mountain is just a place for Qingge to stay.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
When he liked staying here,

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,800
I built a good place for him to live.

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Now the Eastern Palace is his residence.

84
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
I don't care if it's the East Mountain or the West Mountain.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
I am just reminding this friend to be careful of the people.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Yu.

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,200
But my master is very good.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Is he good?

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Master wants me to praise him in front of my master.

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Although Master is not good at speaking, he looks cold.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
But he is very responsible.

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,800
He is willing to help Ruo Xiao.

93
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,600
He is kind and soft-hearted.

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Especially the most important person to him.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,200
He will do his best and give his best.

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Ran Ran, how long have you known him?

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,800
He is the most heartless and heartless person.

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,400
He can even kill his own master.

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,800
Do you think he is still kind?

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Xiao Yu, it's all in the past.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why mention the past?

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Qingge, even if you are very vicious, you can't change reality.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,800
He will always be sorry for your mother.

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
He doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
You shouldn't have done this.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
You shouldn't have done this.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm just a joke.

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,080
He's not from the Cultivation Sect.

119
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,520
You'll hurt him if you do so.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
You and I are strangers.

121
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,320
Don't think about it again.

122
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Get lost!

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Are you all right?

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm fine.

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm fine.

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
I'm fine.

127
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I'm fine.

128
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm fine.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm fine.

130
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
I에m fine!

131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
I baby step.

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
And you get hurt at the hospital.

133
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Exercise.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Your Highness,

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
We can't even touch him.

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
His spirit energy is damaged.

137
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
He's already a little cat.

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't think Mr. Mu can use him anymore.

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,880
That bastard was very close to you.

140
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,400
He turned his back on you.

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
Forget it. I won't force him.

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,400
Xiaoyu, let's go.

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Why do I care more about Master

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
than about Mr. Yu?

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,240
Master is so unhappy for his master.

146
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm sad too.

147
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Where are you going?

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
Are you still thinking about sending Su Yu?

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
But they all left.

150
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
I saw Master moving the fire today.

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,360
I want to make tea for you.

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,280
You'd better try.

153
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes.

154
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Yes.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Don't like Su Yu.

156
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
She can't.

157
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Master has been drinking for you for many years.

158
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,400
He's really confused.

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Why didn't you tell me?

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
What?

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,920
I think you have feelings for him.

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
But you've sealed your heart.

163
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
It's hard to see.

164
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
If I were you,

165
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,120
I'd think Mr. Yu is better.

166
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,040
It's more attractive.

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,880
Shut up!

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,000
No, Master.

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
I think you can tell him that you...

170
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
What's wrong?

171
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,960
Su Mu Tou, can you calm down?

172
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
What's wrong with you?

173
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Because of Su Yu,

174
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm telling you,

175
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,080
you can't suppress

176
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
the reaction of the Ice Palace.

177
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Do you know that?

178
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
Master Su Yu is waiting outside

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,920
to tell Karen about Su Yu's red sigue.

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,800
What's wrong?

181
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Your wife...

182
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,960
She's meeting with her ex.

183
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,480
She should be here with you right away.

184
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,840
You two are Poisu'swedôae now.

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
in the palace of the Great Wall.

186
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,440
How can you seal the spiritual power?

187
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Master.

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't move.

189
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,240
You're such a coward.

190
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,600
Ranran.

191
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,400
Are you here to send your master a meal?

192
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
It's suddenly sunny.

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
It's more comfortable to drink some hot soup.

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
He can't eat anything.

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,800
Don't worry about him.

196
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,440
It's so cold.

197
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,920
Go back and have a rest.

198
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,720
But I said something wrong

199
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840
and made him unhappy.

200
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,400
He should be punished for his crime.

201
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm worried about him.

202
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
Why do you have to be punished?

203
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
It's his own problem.

204
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,520
He should deal with it himself.

205
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,680
Do you know why I didn't

206
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,320
recognize him when he came back to Mount Xi?

207
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,840
He finally got back to life.

208
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,200
We, the local disciples,

209
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
can't be his burden.

210
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,960
Right?

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,720
All right.

212
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Look, it's already sunny.

213
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,680
Go back. Go back.

214
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,600
Master.

215
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,680
Go. Go. Go.

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,520
Xiaoyu.

217
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
I went to find Xiaoshui.

218
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
You're unhappy?

219
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,320
I'm afraid that heartless man

220
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
will hurt you again.

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,040
Brother Jing.

222
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,120
You used to protect me.

223
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
But now I'm the Crown Prince of the country.

224
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
I'm the only one

225
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
who can help the world.

226
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm here.

227
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,520
You don't need to rely on others.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
I've died once.

229
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,440
Who is the one

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,480
who takes my heart?

231
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
I don't understand it yet.

232
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Brother Jing.

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
You finally understand my heart.

234
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,040
This time,

235
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,280
I can't miss it again.

236
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,200
I wanted to propose to you.

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,560
But I was late.

238
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,800
I hope

239
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,920
that it's not too late

240
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,720
to ask you this question.

241
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,200
Brother Jing.

242
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
Brother Jing.

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Will you be my Crown Princess?

254
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
I've been waiting

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
for 18 years.

256
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,520
What a mess!

257
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,160
I wonder how many refugees

258
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,320
have died in the first line of Jiangnan.

259
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,800
Give it to me!

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
Sister!

261
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
Don't hit my sister!

262
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Don't hit my sister!

263
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,600
Give it to me!

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Sister, stop!

265
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Sister, are you okay?

266
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,680
Yes.

267
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
Here.

268
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,560
This is for you.

269
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,200
Sister is still hungry.

270
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,800
Do you want to save some for her?

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,360
It's okay.

272
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
I don't need it.

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
She's so generous.

274
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,640
Why don't you take her back to the mansion

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,600
and do a job?

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
Are you willing to do it?

277
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,280
You're born free.

278
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
You don't have to be a rich slave.

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
I'll find a way out.

280
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll repay you

281
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
for your kindness.

282
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,800
Okay.

283
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,480
I'll wait for you.

284
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,960
Sister.

285
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,240
Why don't we go?

286
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,000
Xiaowu.

287
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,120
It's not a long-term solution to depend on others.

288
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
And we have our own ways.

289
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
We can totally depend on ourselves.

290
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,360
Don't worry.

291
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,360
With you,

292
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,400
I'll definitely let you live.

293
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,400
It's interesting

294
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,080
to rely on yourself.

295
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
I saw you just now.

296
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,120
You're quite good at it.

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,520
Do you want to learn something?

298
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,400
Xing.

299
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
You're really a martial arts master.

300
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
You've learned all my skills.

301
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
I can be a master today.

302
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm sure

303
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,960
you'll be famous soon in the martial arts world.

304
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,840
You'll become a legend in the future.

305
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,560
There's a long way to go.

306
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,640
Xiaowu will make progress, too.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,600
Right?

308
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,560
Xiaowu.

309
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
You need to know that

310
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,560
you're a common master.

311
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Xiaowu.

312
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,920
When we were in the dark,

313
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,280
if you had put on that pack of leather shoes,

314
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,560
I would have been saved.

315
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
It's not like we two sisters

316
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,600
have been walking for half a month in the snow.

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,040
You've always ruined my spirit.

318
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,080
It's hard to improve your cultivation.

319
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,280
Why?

320
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
Why do you always

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,320
put others' lives before mine?

322
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,160
Xiaowu.

323
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
There's a long way to go.

324
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,880
It's okay if you don't practice.

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
How can it be okay?

326
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
It's okay if you don't practice.

327
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,920
You can be a legend in the future.

328
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,360
You're not old.

329
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,240
But I...

330
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm a mortal.

331
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
I'll fall down one day.

332
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,880
I'll die.

333
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,360
You make me see

334
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,880
the endless and vast world of cultivation.

335
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,560
But I can't get anything.

336
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,640
When I'm old...

337
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,240
What should I do?

338
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't worry.

339
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,800
By then,

340
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,200
I'll make the best pill for you.

341
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,840
You taught me that

342
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
it's not a long-term relationship.

343
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,560
I won't be under your control forever.

344
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm Mu Qingge and Muran Wu.

345
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm here to repay your kindness.

346
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Reward?

347
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Eight years ago,

348
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,560
you and my sister

349
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,760
had a fight.

350
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
It's you.

351
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
You really remember it now?

352
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
Since you're here,

353
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,680
go to the mansion and have a seat.

354
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
I have...

355
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
Let Xiaowu take me there.

356
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,880
Okay.

357
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,480
Okay.

358
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,040
Do you like this place?

359
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
Yes.

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,320
I've made the pill.

361
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,920
I can help Xiaoyu.

362
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,800
I'll help her.

363
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,000
Why...

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
Why did I do that?

365
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,640
Xiaowu, tell Xiaoyu

366
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,280
that I'll help her.

367
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
I can never give her

368
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,520
what you can give her.

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,920
How could she not want it?

370
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
She's not only weak,

371
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,840
but also powerful.

372
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,000
You can never beat her.

373
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,640
We're just sisters.

374
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
You've taken all the benefits

375
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,760
of saving the world.

376
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,280
Tianci is yours.

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
I hate Tianmei for giving it to me.

378
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Now,

379
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
you even took away

380
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
the one I love.

381
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
Why did you give away

382
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,440
all the wealth and glory?

383
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,320
I don't believe you.

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll take everything

385
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,160
from you.

386
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Qingge, will you?

387
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Soon...

388
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,640
I...

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,960
I'm not dreaming, right?

390
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,320
You gave me a chance

391
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,040
to realize my enlightenment

392
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,520
in my youth.

393
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,880
I've let go

394
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,160
of my past bunenteous hate.

395
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,920
I want to stay with the one

396
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
I've visaed my life destined

397
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,320
to live.

398
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,320
I, Su Yu, will never betray you.

399
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Once Father's death is over,

400
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I will hold a grand ceremony.

401
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
The Crown Prince's position is mine now.

402
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Sh-Shifu.

403
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Why are you practicing martial arts?

404
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Nothing.

405
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I just want to dig some ice lotus seeds

406
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
and make lotus seed soup for Shifu.

407
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Since you're free,

408
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
why don't you get to know martial arts?

409
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
If the heart is weak and weak,

410
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
the sky will collapse.

411
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
What does the heart mean?

412
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
What good is it?

413
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
It?

414
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Childe Yu?

415
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Shifu is still in the ring.

416
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
You're right.

417
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Shifu must be very sad

418
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
that Grand Master and Childe Yu are gone.

419
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
I'm still saying that.

420
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Why don't you praise Shifu

421
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
and make him feel better?

422
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
How can I compare to my Shifu

423
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
when he's better than others?

424
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Shifu is elegant and elegant,

425
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
like a turtle, like a cockroach,

426
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
tall and tall,

427
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
no,

428
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
tall and tall,

429
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
like this ice lotus seed.

430
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
It looks a little cold,

431
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
but after tasting it,

432
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
it's really heart-wrenching.

433
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
It's clearly a kind of kindness.

434
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
You really think so?

435
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Just now...

436
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
The hair is the most pure place.

437
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
The stars are clear,

438
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
so it can be established.

439
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Lies will be shaken.

440
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
I didn't lie either.

441
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
I just exaggerated a little.

442
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
So,

443
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
what's good about Su Yu?

444
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Actually, Shifu and Childe Yu

445
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
are different.

446
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
He is gentle and gentle.

447
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,320
He smiles like a spring breeze.

448
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
But...

449
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
There's a but, Shifu.

450
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
But Shifu looks like a cold,

451
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
but his heart is still hot.

452
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Shifu's kindness can't be paid off,

453
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
but he makes Shifu angry

454
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
thousands of times every day.

455
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Xue Rangya, you're really something.

456
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Go.

457
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Come out.

458
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Your Highness.

459
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,320
From now on, you'll be responsible for protecting Qingge.

460
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
But with his personality,

461
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
he won't accept it.

462
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Don't let him find out.

463
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Yes.

464
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
I understand.

465
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Useless.

466
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Can you only improve this much?

467
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
It's too slow.

468
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Your Highness.

469
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Who let you in?

470
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Get out.

471
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Your Highness, don't be too hasty.

472
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
You're not a good person.

473
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
You're not a good person.

474
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
You can't be too hasty.

475
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
You'll be poisoned by the demon.

476
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I once got a spirit elixir.

477
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
It can help you recover your power quickly.

478
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Such a useful thing.

479
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
You're not free.

480
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Tu Jiuyun, you...

481
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
You...

482
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm doing this for you.

483
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
You can rest in peace.

484
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,320
This spirit elixir is really useful.

485
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Tu Jiuyun,

486
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
even though I'm in seclusion,

487
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I have eyes to watch your every move

488
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
and the news of your power.

489
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I advise you not to think about taking the throne.

490
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Elder.

491
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
You've given the spirit elixir to the Immortal.

492
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,320
I hope you can collect the spirit elixir

493
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
and use your heart to make the elixir.

494
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
He'll understand your loyalty.

495
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
He won't target you again.

496
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I have half of the Chi Men Order with me.

497
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
He'll take me as the eye of the eye.

498
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
But I promised Master.

499
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I promised to keep the spirit elixir in my hand.

500
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
This is Master's wish.

501
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Yes.

502
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Back off.

503
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,320
I won't let you get lost.

504
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
You're injured?

505
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Just take it.

506
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Just calm down.

507
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
I have the elixir of life.

508
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Eat it.

509
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,160
Just one bite?

510
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,200
What about you?

511
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Just eat it.

512
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,960
This time, it's just you and me.

513
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm your boss.

514
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
As long as you don't drag me down,

515
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,720
we will definitely win.

516
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,160
I will definitely not drag you down in the future.

517
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,560
The past...

518
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,600
I can never find it again.

519
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,280
The Nine-Turning Iron Furnace of the Grand Master.

520
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,840
Master actually gave it to me.

521
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,480
I even made Master angry.

522
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,360
This is so wrong.

523
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,640
What?

524
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,440
You dare to make trouble?

525
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,040
I heard that back then,

526
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,040
Grand Master was the first man to make elixir.

527
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,520
He did it to give you

528
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
the best elixir in the world.

529
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,720
A demon like Grand Master

530
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,680
actually cares about someone like that?

531
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,120
I think

532
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
Grand Master is really a legend.

533
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,240
Ever since he came to the mountain,

534
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,120
the whole West Mountain

535
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,960
has been covered by Master's love.

536
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,640
I can't breathe anymore.

537
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,080
When will such a poor life

538
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,840
end?

539
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,880
It seems that Master's love

540
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
is really serious.

541
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,680
We have to find a way

542
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,760
to help him recover.

543
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Li...

544
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,280
Oh, right.

545
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,640
It's written in the text

546
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,040
how to make Longyan liver.

547
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,520
Why don't I make something

548
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
that Master likes to eat

549
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,000
and eat it?

550
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,400
I'm leaving first.

551
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,280
Okay.

552
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
Love...

553
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
Love...

554
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
I have an idea, too.

555
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,680
It's hard to choose.

556
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,360
What are you doing here?

557
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,360
Look. Look. Look.

558
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,840
Sit.

559
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,920
As the saying goes,

560
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
there is no place in the world without a peach blossom.

561
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,120
The best way to get out of love and hurt is

562
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,800
to enter the next stage.

563
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
As long as we find

564
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,160
a female immortal who is as beautiful as Master,

565
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,560
can't we find a way

566
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,960
to satisfy Master?

567
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
Is it okay for you to do this?

568
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,240
Is this too much?

569
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,520
Don't worry.

570
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,800
I heard that Master was originally from a royal family.

571
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,080
He wasn't

572
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,440
a man of great ambition.

573
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:08,840
Since he likes the

574
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,000
taste of the peach blossom,

575
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,080
Xue Ranran,

576
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,160
you must be confused

577
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
because you've been practicing for years.

578
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Master.

579
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
Why don't you practice

580
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,520
and make up here?

581
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,880
Master.

582
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,960
We just think

583
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,600
the West Mountain is too quiet.

584
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,640
Why don't we invite some immortal

585
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,800
to be our guest?

586
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,200
Master, look.

587
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,240
This Song Qingyan, a master of Qingyang Sect,

588
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,280
was the leader of the last year's

589
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Xianrong Ranking.

590
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,120
You may know

591
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,480
how much he is good at.

592
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,560
Master Song is best at

593
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,480
Zhuyan tree.

594
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
So he can still

595
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,420
clear the

596
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,040
mountain and go to the West Mountain.

597
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,600
Master,

598
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,120
don't you want him to come to the West Mountain

599
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,520
to ask for some immortal?

600
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,600
He has a good name

601
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,400
and a good temperament.

602
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,640
But what does it have to do with me?

603
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,680
Master, you may not know.

604
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,480
There was a saying in the Immortal Sect

605
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,040
that said,

606
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
if you have Song Qingyan,

607
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,800
you will be a couple

608
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,800
with the one who will die.

609
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,640
Really?

610
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,800
Take a closer look.

611
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,840
It's really right.

612
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,080
It's really right.

613
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,040
Master, if you like,

614
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,800
why don't you invite some immortal

615
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,840
to the West Mountain

616
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,720
to see how to do Zhuyan tree?

617
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
Isn't it a good idea?

618
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,200
You guys think I'm old

619
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,080
after talking so much?

620
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,760
No, no, no.

621
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
Master, you're so

622
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
arrogant and energetic.

623
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,680
You're younger than me.

624
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,080
Change another one.

625
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,320
Master,

626
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,160
look at the Immortal Bi Yun of the Cang Qiong Sect.

627
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,480
It's said that

628
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,280
he has a good voice

629
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
like a hundred-spirit bird.

630
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,520
Just listening to him

631
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
makes me feel like I'm in the fairyland.

632
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,720
If you have any questions,

633
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,120
you can ask him.

634
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
So you think I'm bad-tempered

635
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,800
and have a bad heart?

636
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,280
Yes.

637
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
Change another one.

638
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,560
I don't need to say

639
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,680
more about the immortal.

640
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,520
I heard that

641
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,840
you two know each other since you were young.

642
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,120
We...

643
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
We have a good relationship.

644
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,600
If it weren't for the emperors,

645
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,400
you and Feng Xian

646
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,840
would have been married long ago.

647
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,120
Master,

648
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,200
you want him to go up the mountain and have a rest?

649
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,000
Enough.

650
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
I understand what you mean.

651
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,000
I've given you so much courage.

652
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,000
You dare to touch me.

653
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Take these away.

654
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
Go to the West Market and practice for two hours.

655
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,960
Yes, master.

656
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Go.

657
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,160
Oh no!

658
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Ran Ran,

659
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,280
why did you put the messenger talisman in it?

660
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,480
It's all over.

661
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,480
The peach blossoms in the back hill are beautiful.

662
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
The scenery is beautiful.

663
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,040
I've admired the female army for a long time.

664
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,680
I'm willing to be with the demon.

665
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,040
Immortal, please have some tea.

666
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,440
It's so lively.

667
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,840
Are they all here to enjoy the flowers?

668
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,160
Even the peach blossom immortal is here.

669
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,800
It's really more beautiful than the legend.

670
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,800
No wonder people say Su Yishui is charming

671
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,200
and troubles all people.

672
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,520
I have to say

673
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,480
Mu Qingge had good taste.

674
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,400
Master doesn't like to make trouble.

675
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
We'll be scolded by master later.

676
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,960
Su, what do you mean?

677
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,880
I have some good feelings for you.

678
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,360
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

679
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,760
You called us all here

680
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,840
to make us fight against you.

681
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,920
You're so selfish.

682
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,360
You're so heartless.

683
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Let's go.

684
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,280
We can't let him go

685
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
no matter how beautiful he is.

686
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,160
Immortals, be sober.

687
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,600
Go back and have a rest.

688
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,920
You can leave if you want.

689
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,680
I finally see Su.

690
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,920
I want to stay.

691
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,320
I didn't mean to make fun of you.

692
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,760
It's these unfilial disciples who misuse magic weapons

693
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,720
and make ridiculous things.

694
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,320
You made the trouble yourself.

695
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
Apologize for it yourself.

696
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,320
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,360
I'm sorry.

698
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,040
I didn't mean to do that.

699
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,600
It's my fault.

700
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,040
I made a mistake.

701
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,600
I made you run away for nothing.

702
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,120
I apologize to you.

703
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,360
And us.

704
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,360
We're sorry.

705
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,360
We're sorry.

706
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,760
Since it's the unfilial disciples,

707
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,840
it means we have good reasons to help.

708
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,160
Su,

709
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,560
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm sorry.

711
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Su,

713
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,640
it doesn't matter whether it's good or not.

714
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,520
You can cultivate your feelings.

715
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,360
You can leave if you want.

716
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,960
I want to stay alone.

717
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,800
It's more beautiful than the peach blossoms in the West Mountain.

718
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
Immortals, please go back.

719
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,680
I've fixed the path of unfilial love.

720
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I didn't mean it.

721
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,120
Is it true that it's hard to forget

722
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,200
the love between Su and Mu Qingge?

723
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
See them off.

724
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,040
Immortals, please.

725
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,800
The Peach Blossom Sect only teaches people to pursue love.

726
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
They never break the marriage.

727
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,680
Your disciple made me humiliated today.

728
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,000
And all the sects are famous.

729
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,160
You want to send me away

730
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,600
just because of an apology?

731
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
My disciple has already been punished.

732
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,600
If you're still dissatisfied,

733
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
just punish me.

734
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,960
Su Yishui is so silly to reveal the truth.

735
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,080
This female disciple...

736
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,120
I see.

737
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,280
The more Su scolds the female disciple,

738
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,360
the more she cares about her.

739
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay.

740
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,280
Since it's a misunderstanding,

741
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,560
let's leave here.

742
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Don't delay it.

743
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,960
Since Master Wen has said it,

744
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,400
I won't stay here.

745
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,640
Goodbye.

746
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,520
On your second trial,

747
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,440
there were two of them.

748
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,160
Now,

749
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,640
none of them is the same Su.

750
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Yes.

751
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,080
Here!

752
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
The confirmed teacher,

753
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,560
الكهluded him!

754
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,640
What?

755
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,280
He is the one who terrorizes her?

756
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,400
I heard that he is the one who made our student

757
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,680
answer the questions without causing trouble!

758
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,720
Revealing Su's answer

759
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,360
A person who

760
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,160
is nobler than me

761
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,760
will definitely get ч濒

762
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
Whoever falls in the peach blossom want

763
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,320
will offer love

764
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,000
to the person

765
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Show them whatispers are better.

766
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,360
Did you refuse me?

767
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,320
Do you really see this?

768
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
Let me beat you.

769
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,120
I dare to beat you.

770
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
I'll help you.

771
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,800
Xuan Ruoran, are you crazy?

772
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,680
Master, your long-sleeved shirt is too boring.

773
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
It doesn't look good at all.

774
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Let me change your clothes to red.

775
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,800
Master, you've been tired for so long.

776
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,080
It's time to change your clothes.

777
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Change yourself.

778
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,120
They say that you look the most charming when you're in red.

779
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,880
You really are a person who can change people's lives.

780
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
You're so good at talking.

781
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,840
No wonder the Grand Master forced you to go up the mountain.

782
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,080
You must have been bewitched by your beauty.

783
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
You're drunk,

784
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,880
and you're so drunk that you're so drunk.

785
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,840
Xuan Ruoran, listen to me.

786
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,440
I'll punish you.

787
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,920
I really don't understand.

788
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,040
Why is your beautiful face always so cold?

789
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,960
Your deep eyes are always cold.

790
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,200
Your voice is always so beautiful.

791
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,640
Punish me. Punish me.

792
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,960
Xuan Ruoran, are you drunk?

793
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm not drunk.

794
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,440
Look.

795
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,680
People's bodies won't lie.

796
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,360
I grow a tree when I'm drunk.

797
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
I don't have one now.

798
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,360
Why is there a green onion here?

799
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,160
Master, do you remember the day we stole green onions together?

800
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
Let me put it on your new clothes.

801
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
Light it up.

802
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,880
You...

803
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,640
What do you want?

804
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,120
Master.

805
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,400
You're so smart.

806
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,880
Why can't you get out of here?

807
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,600
Since you have a new lover,

808
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,600
you should let go of the past and look forward.

809
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,600
Ridiculous.

810
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
When did I think about it?

811
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,080
Are you awake?

812
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Did you make a mess?

813
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,640
Master.

814
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,040
I don't care if you believe it or not.

815
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,080
I just want to apologize.

816
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,360
If I knew it, I would have listened to Ran Ran.

817
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
She's giving Master the eye drops.

818
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't be like this.

819
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,680
Don't mention it.

820
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,400
It's embarrassing.

821
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,440
Master, let me help you.

822
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,760
It's about time I changed clothes.

823
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
You are joining me.

824
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
Exactly.

825
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
You should change clothes.

826
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Change your mood.

827
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,480
Why is your beautiful face always so cold?

828
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,080
Duan Nie.

829
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Such deep eyes,

830
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
and such a beautiful voice.

831
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Duan Wu-Nian.

832
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Why can't you get out of the困手情谷?

833
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,560
Mo Zhi,

834
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
please stop my Wu-Nian.

835
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Duan Wu-Nian.

836
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Why can't you get out of the困手情谷?

837
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Why can't you get out of the困手情谷?

838
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Stop my Wu-Nian.

839
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,560
The moon falls, the night flies, the snow falls, and the sky is empty.

840
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,560
The sky is dark, the clouds are dark, and the dust is all over the face.

841
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,560
Tears are like dreams, and they are all gone.

842
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,560
The past is only a shadow, and the future is only a dream.

843
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,560
The moon is in front of me, and I am returning to you.

844
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,560
The moon is in front of me, and I am returning to you.

845
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,560
The moon is in front of me, and I am returning to you.

846
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
The heart is still watered down.

847
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,560
The tears are falling, and the heart is still unfulfilled.

848
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,560
The moon is in front of me, and I am returning to you.

849
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,560
The wind is still blowing on my face.

850
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I am not afraid of losing the world because of you.

851
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,560
If I could have a year of fame and power,

852
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,560
I would be a man without a face because of you.

853
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I could not get past the heaven, and I would be a man without a face.

854
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Why do I have to be alone in this world?

855
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,560
I chase after the eternal night.

856
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,560
I only want to be with you day after day.

857
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,560
If I could have a year of fame and power,

858
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I would be a man without a face because of you.

859
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:45,560
I could not get past the heaven, and I would be a man without a face.

860
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,560
I used to be a man without a face.

861
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,560
I am not afraid of losing the world because of you.

862
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,560
I could not get past the heaven, and I would be a man without a face.

863
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,560
I used to be a man without a face.
