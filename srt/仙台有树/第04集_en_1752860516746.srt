1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,940
Let's break the needle.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,940
What?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Find the silver ring with the hat on.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,220
Put all on it.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,220
If it's too dark to see, I'll follow you

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,820
To face the love and hate in this world

7
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,020
Only wish to turn back time

8
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,820
To experience both the good and the bad

9
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,020
Succeeded in reincarnation, only then can I understand the preciousness

10
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,020
The spring is coming back

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,220
The destined love is overshadowed

12
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,620
But I still don't regret it

13
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,820
Waiting for the falling flowers to be separated

14
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,620
I still want to be with you

15
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,020
And slowly understand you

16
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,020
The serving tea

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,820
Episode 10

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,660
Day in the primeiro

19
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,660
Shoot

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,860
What is my name

21
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm a missions idol

22
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,060
Shoot who's chased

23
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,420
Kill him!

24
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,700
Take him to the Tomb of the Deceased tomorrow.

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,220
Let the leader come to interrogate him.

26
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,060
Yes.

27
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,340
He's so stubborn.

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,220
I don't know what he's up to.

29
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,060
Brother.

30
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,860
Brother.

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,260
All right, all right. Don't cry.

32
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,020
Thanks to Mu Xian Shi's help,

33
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,420
my son was saved.

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,220
He's so kind to my family.

35
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,260
I don't know how to repay him.

36
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,140
It's just a favor.

37
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,380
You're welcome.

38
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,820
Sister, you're so nice.

39
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,940
Brother, you should marry Xuan Xuan sooner.

40
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,300
Forgive me

41
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,780
for speaking ill of my son.

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,740
You're young.

43
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,380
Guards.

44
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,420
Take them inside the house.

45
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,460
Go to have a good rest.

46
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Brother.

47
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,060
Father set up a banquet for you.

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,340
Why did you leave so soon?

50
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,380
An important disciple is waiting for me.

51
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,380
But...

52
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,340
Just go to the West Mountain to find me.

53
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
Sister,

54
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,260
I want to stay in the capital.

55
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
You like to have fun.

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,940
The West Mountain is a bit boring.

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Then stay.

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,540
Take this jade.

59
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,100
It will blow when you're in danger.

60
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,700
I will come to save you.

61
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
I'm leaving.

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,260
一線

63
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,340
Did Master egg test me?

64
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
You've suffered for a whole night.

65
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,780
Drink some water first.

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,380
Sect Leader and Grand Master,

67
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,380
you're being kind to me.

68
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,580
I know everything.

69
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,780
Why do I need to interrogate you?

70
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Su Yishui,

71
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,580
how is Prince of Pingqing?

72
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
What do you mean?

73
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,180
He's talented,

74
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,180
but he deliberately hides his abilities.

75
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
Every time he goes down the mountain to train,

76
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,380
he always goes to the capital for a few days.

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,980
Such a special disciple

78
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,580
only needs to be a little more careful.

79
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,380
His identity will be found out eventually.

80
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Sect Leader and Grand Master,

81
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,980
I did this because I wanted to.

82
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,580
But there are rules that are not followed in the whole sect.

83
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
I don't accept royal descendants.

84
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,780
That's why I hid my identity.

85
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
Since things have come to this point,

86
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,980
why are you lying?

87
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,580
This is the order of my sect leader, Jiuhua Mountain.

88
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,180
If you want to go to the Cangjing Tower,

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
you just need to promise me one thing.

90
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
What do you want me to promise?

91
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,380
There are not many things that I want in the whole sect.

92
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,380
Except for cultivating the Dao,

93
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,180
I hope that someone will be there in the future.

94
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,580
Since the day you entered Jiuhua Mountain,

95
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,980
I have been thinking of taking you as my disciple.

96
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
It's a pity that you have hidden too much.

97
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,980
I can't just say it for no reason.

98
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,180
What happened today is a good thing.

99
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Yishui,

100
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,980
if you are willing to kneel down,

101
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,580
drop your blood into the jade butterfly,

102
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,980
and cast your soul,

103
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,580
and enter my sect in the future,

104
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
and never get up,

105
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,180
you can take this token.

106
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,780
I will also accept it in a clear bag,

107
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,780
and teach you the right way to enter the sect.

108
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,780
What do you think?

109
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,780
Yes.

110
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,980
I would like to pay homage to Si Wen,

111
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
and onto the sect starting from now,

112
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,980
I promise that I will remember your advice.

113
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,380
My good student.

114
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,980
You... You're playing tricks!

115
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,180
So what?

116
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
I'll kill you!

117
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,780
You're a gambler.

118
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm just a gambler.

119
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,180
Okay.

120
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Drink some tea.

121
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,980
Don't you dare!

122
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,980
I'll drink this cup of tea.

123
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,580
Okay.

124
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,980
We're done.

125
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,780
You're my good disciple now.

126
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,980
Xiaoshui, let's go back to Mount Xi.

127
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
I'm just giving it to you.

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,980
Demoness Mu Qingge,

129
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,180
how dare you!

130
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,980
Tell Old Man Kaiyuan

131
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
that I'm grateful for his favor.

132
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Go back and thank Master!

133
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,580
Yes.

134
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
Master, how should we decide?

135
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,180
Senior Kaiyuan,

136
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,780
I've been thinking that

137
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,580
why would he suddenly

138
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,580
give up his position?

139
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,580
It seems that he was forced by the Demoness.

140
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
We'll go to the West Mountain to save him.

141
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
But Su Cheng

142
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
still became Mu Qingge's disciple.

143
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,180
Whether he was forced or willingly,

144
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,780
since he has already made a choice,

145
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,380
he is no longer my disciple.

146
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,580
Why would I go to the West Mountain to get him?

147
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,780
Moreover,

148
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,580
he has ended up in the Cangjing House

149
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,180
and broke the rules.

150
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,380
He is no longer my disciple.

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,380
This is my West Mountain.

152
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
Master!

153
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Master!

154
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
Master is back!

155
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,180
Master!

156
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,380
Master, you're finally back!

157
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,180
Why did you go so long?

158
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
You've searched for the Beautiful Young Master everywhere

159
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,380
and released him.

160
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,980
Master, who is he?

161
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,180
This is your new disciple, Su Yishui.

162
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,780
Master, you've been gone for so long

163
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,380
and you've just received a new disciple?

164
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,380
Come, let's go around the West Mountain.

165
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,780
In the future, let's practice with Master.

166
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Let's go.

167
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,180
Mu Qingge!

168
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,580
You want to hurt me again?

169
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,180
If you touch me with your dirty hands, I'll kill you!

170
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
Keep your spiritual power in check.

171
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,780
Zeng Yi.

172
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
Yes.

173
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,980
Take him to his room.

174
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Junior Su, I'm your 14th senior disciple.

175
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Come with me.

176
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Master,

177
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,980
I think this junior Su's luck

178
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,580
is not good.

179
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,180
It will accumulate you.

180
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,380
I know you're good at looking up and down.

181
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,180
But if you can leave this talented wolf boy

182
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,380
in the West Mountain,

183
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,980
doesn't it make your master look great?

184
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
That...

185
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,180
Master said that you suffered internal injury

186
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,980
and got a lot of blood.

187
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,780
He told you to take those medicines

188
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,180
and then take some baths.

189
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Get lost!

190
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,980
I've waited for a long time.

191
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
You haven't washed yourself yet.

192
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,380
Demoness, don't try to get away with it.

193
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,380
You know I'm a demoness.

194
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,980
Why don't you just listen to me?

195
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Kill me!

196
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,580
It's a pity that you killed such a good disciple.

197
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
You should keep it carefully.

198
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Very good.

199
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,380
This way, you can see clearly.

200
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,980
I can do it.

201
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,180
I told you that no matter how the Jiuhua Sect

202
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,380
is beaten,

203
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,980
it's just a skin wound.

204
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
How can you hurt your lungs?

205
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,380
It's actually a stone bone fire.

206
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Lord Pingqing punished you?

207
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,780
Your face is so cold that it's almost a frost.

208
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
You still have a bit of heat in your heart.

209
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,380
You're not willing to kill this second young master.

210
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
No wonder Lord Pingqing punished you.

211
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,780
Yin Shui, don't kill my brother.

212
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,380
I'm begging you.

213
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,580
Don't come over.

214
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I have a dragon eye here.

215
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm going to throw it. I'm begging you.

216
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
I'll give it to you. Hurry.

217
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,180
A dragon eye?

218
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,180
I'm going to throw it. I'm begging you.

219
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Don't come over.

220
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,180
Get up. Come with me.

221
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,980
I sent you to Jiuhua to practice the immortal technique.

222
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,980
You killed a child, but you lost it.

223
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
You're a child.

224
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,980
Yin Shui,

225
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,180
it doesn't matter if what you said is true or not.

226
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,180
But there's one thing you need to remember.

227
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,180
If you can't do what I told you to do,

228
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
you'll be as hurt as you die.

229
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,380
Yin Shui,

230
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Young Master,

232
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,180
Yin Shui!

234
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Yin Shui!

235
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
Is it true?

236
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,380
How does it have anything to do with you?

237
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,980
I helped you to force out your blood.

238
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,380
You're so fierce.

239
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,980
Take off your clothes.

240
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Don't worry.

241
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,580
I'll go.

242
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,780
You're still looking at me like that?

243
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,180
Do you really think my disciples are all men?

244
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,780
They're doing magic in the West Mountain,

245
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
but aren't men the most important?

246
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,780
Lv Yuan, Jing Yin Lv. Jiang Huai Mu, Xi Hua Cao.

247
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,180
Wang Sui Zhi can be an official.

248
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,980
Zeng Yi loves to make magic devices.

249
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,980
All my disciples are talented,

250
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,780
but they're not good at martial arts.

251
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,580
If they're in other schools, they will be left behind.

252
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,180
What a shame.

253
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
I brought them here to the West Mountain,

254
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,780
so I can give them to some interesting disciples.

255
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,580
You're talking nonsense.

256
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,980
Aren't you only taking in men from the West Mountain?

257
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Once they become my disciples,

258
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
even if they cause trouble,

259
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
I'll be responsible for them.

260
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,180
So it's not too much to take in pretty girls.

261
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Are you making fun of me for what you did?

262
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Xiao Shui,

263
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
what you did

264
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
was all Lord Ping's plan.

265
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,580
Am I right?

266
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,780
You're so talented,

267
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,780
but you're willing to be a chess piece.

268
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
Don't you feel sorry?

269
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,380
How do you know I'm a chess piece,

270
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,580
and not a person who knows chess?

271
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,580
Before I became the strongest person,

272
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
I always had no one.

273
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,180
But one day,

274
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,780
I'll take them all in my hands.

275
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,580
If you become the strongest,

276
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,580
you'll be tainted by your desires.

277
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,780
In the end, you can't even control yourself.

278
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,180
This way,

279
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,580
you'll easily lose yourself.

280
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,780
You don't need to say such useless words.

281
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,780
Tell me, why do you insist on taking me as your disciple?

282
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,380
Because for so many years,

283
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,980
you're the only martial spirit I've met.

284
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,780
You're the one who can inherit me the most.

285
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,380
Secondly,

286
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
you're too cruel.

287
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,580
It's fine if you haven't met me.

288
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,580
Since you've met me, I must teach you well.

289
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,840
Otherwise, you'll be killed and be a

290
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,340
living hell sooner or later.

291
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,580
Isn't it simple enough?

292
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,580
Then let's see how long you can hold me back.

293
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,980
I'll kill whoever wants to kill me sooner or later.

294
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,780
I see.

295
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,380
Fine.

296
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,180
Mu Qingge, the sect leader of West Mountain,

297
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,980
has broken the ground and has been in a state of water.

298
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,580
I'll allow her to take my life

299
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,980
without being controlled by the sect.

300
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,180
I'll kill you.

301
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
I'll kill you.

302
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,380
I'll kill you.

303
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,180
You want me to kill you?

304
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,380
Since you want to kill,

305
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I'll take the killing.

306
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,580
Don't regret it.

307
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,580
Sword Technique Tai Chi.

308
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,580
Killing me isn't for nothing.

309
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,980
Every time you fail, you have to suffer.

310
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,180
You're killing me with your own hands.

311
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
You don't want to live anymore?

312
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,580
It's good that I can kill you.

313
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,780
You're cruel to others and yourself.

314
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,180
You have to get punished.

315
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,180
What do you mean?

316
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,980
Play the zither for me.

317
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,780
Is this a punishment for a man?

318
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,180
It's not for others.

319
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,980
It's a severe punishment for you.

320
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
I won't play.

321
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,780
Then I'll take your sword.

322
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,980
From now on, you'll only play the zither.

323
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,780
It's good to be a zither teacher.

324
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,280
Want to learn the most thoughtful first practice of the zither first?

325
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,580
Let us go to the school.

326
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,980
Aj alignment.

327
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,780
A whole zither has West Lake's best slip,

328
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,480
a leading figure of Water Rogue.(i.e A euxine snake, A hao'uZi, from Qingqi's Ode to the Moonbright Spal você queria dizer spoilers de Nile,Go Bath, and the Seas of Heaven in Transcendents!)

329
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,980
It really hurts to hear this Arrangement roasted béta into my mouth tonight.

330
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,420
The good music

331
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,260
played by you

332
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,700
is still

333
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,860
a terrible song.

334
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,700
Come with me.

335
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,140
Mu Qing,

336
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,860
what are you going to do?

337
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,580
You have to kill the heart.

338
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,140
I'll leave these little things to you.

339
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,300
One more string

340
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,820
is a duet.

341
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,060
What do you mean?

342
00:22:49,060 --> 00:23:17,960
Have you finished

343
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,120
Start.

344
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,520
The cure is here.

345
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
All right.

346
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,200
People with disabilities

347
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,000
have to come and have it treated.

348
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
Such a good conduct...

349
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,360
Hm?

350
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,280
Be quick.

351
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,520
I was justos fever.

352
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,120
I couldn't sleep until I woke up in the morning.

353
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Are you scared?

354
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,840
Make do.

355
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,620
It looks so good.

356
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,720
Have a try.

357
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,860
What?

358
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,200
You ruined it?

359
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,860
I will definitely kill you.

360
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,400
We agreed to come back every three months to read the letter of love.

361
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
You almost got late.

362
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,240
I just got there.

363
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
Where's the letter of love?

364
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,880
It's not that late.

365
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I still remember that I'm a good old man.

366
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,280
Li Zi Gao.

367
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,640
When I picked you up on the roadside a few years ago,

368
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,480
you were hungry and had a runny nose.

369
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,960
After so many years,

370
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
I didn't expect you to grow so big.

371
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,960
Brother Qing, I heard you have a disciple.

372
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
What kind of person is he?

373
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
He's the son of Prince Ping.

374
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,160
He's a thorn.

375
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,440
I heard he's a cruel person.

376
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
How are you going to teach him?

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,840
First, I'll remove his murderous intent.

378
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,800
Then, I'll teach him to follow the right and wrong.

379
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,360
And then, I'll make him a golden elixir.

380
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,720
That way, the world will have a more righteous teacher.

381
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,000
If you really received a disciple,

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
wouldn't that be a shame to the royal family?

383
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,160
Do you think Prince Ping is a good person?

384
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,240
Of course not.

385
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,960
Prince Ping is a very cruel person.

386
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
On the contrary, Xiao Yu's father,

387
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Prince Zong, is a loving person.

388
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,520
He's a good prince who is kind and kind.

389
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,560
But it has nothing to do with me.

390
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,760
I just received a disciple. I'm happy.

391
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
This is a big trouble.

392
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,200
A few days ago, I was hanging a red sun for you.

393
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,600
But suddenly, it was covered by clouds.

394
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,120
Brother Qing, you have a lot of cultivation.

395
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,840
You should follow the will of the heavens and fly as soon as possible.

396
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,520
It's hard to take Su Yishu as your disciple.

397
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
Thank you for reminding me.

398
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
But even if there's a problem,

399
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,120
I'll just take it easy.

400
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,920
Fly as a fairy,

401
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,480
and feel lonely when I hear it.

402
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,160
The immortals in the heavens must be very boring.

403
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,320
Why don't you just be free and free in this world?

404
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,040
Eat, drink, and have fun.

405
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,280
And have a disciple to teach you.

406
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
How interesting!

407
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,040
There's a prostitute here.

408
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,960
I can't bear to leave.

409
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,360
The prostitute

410
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,040
is another burden.

411
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,840
If Su Yishu industry게 superior to yours,

412
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,960
what will you do the next time?

413
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,600
Of course I'll just need to clean up your stockfully잖아요.

414
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm afraid you can't do it.

415
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,920
Since you were a child, you're usually THE &%%$%%bres confused.

416
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,720
You almost vezes something bad in your Honest.

417
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Everything must be behind you.

418
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
But you have to know

419
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
that people have their own lives.

420
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,240
Sometimes,

421
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,600
you can save people,

422
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,240
but you can't save yourself.

423
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,440
Don't put yourself in it.

424
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
I won't.

425
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,280
Fine.

426
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,320
I know.

427
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,240
Sometimes,

428
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,960
you can't persuade a maid.

429
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
This yard has been here for so long.

430
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm tired of it.

431
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,960
It's time to go out.

432
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
Where are you going?

433
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm going to travel around the world.

434
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I'll see how interesting

435
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,760
the red dust you mentioned is.

436
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,360
I must heal myself and get out of this place.

437
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
Hurry and get back to my room.

438
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Your power is very small.

439
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,640
by making the difference over weather.

440
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,160
Why are you spaced out?

441
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,160
Make a seat.

442
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,880
Leng Z starving.

443
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,040
When did you let Swordsman leave his secret CLOCK anyways?

444
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,520
Subzi Tai Chi was in your hands

445
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,020
Humans are convinced that in a health fail,

446
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,940
there will be no hope.

447
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,280
Have faith and focus.

448
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,240
studied the new music

449
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,180
fight with your inner spirit

450
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,920
and become the

451
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,280
squadron's Overwatch statements.

452
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,540
Do you understand me?

453
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,940
Sister.

454
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,220
Hello.

455
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,800
What's wrong?

456
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
spotted it.

457
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,820
It's one of them,

458
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,200
while you only saw it in appearance.

459
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't know what it is.

460
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,100
It's quite something.

461
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,800
His hand is receipt of that hand.

462
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,800
That hand.

463
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,900
Only 9 billion gold coins ran out.

464
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,340
You eat them and sleep them.

465
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:14,520
And

466
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,280
I don't know that my father is already at the foot of the West Mountain.

467
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,080
Is that so?

468
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,880
Don't forget.

469
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,680
Once I can enter the spiritual power into your body, I can control you.

470
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,280
This Xuan Ying bottle is a container for the spiritual power.

471
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,280
As long as I gently shake it, I can attack the spiritual power in your body

472
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,680
and make you unable to escape.

473
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
You are not allowed to escape.

474
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,680
So, don't play tricks with me.

475
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,280
I dare not.

476
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,680
Do you know that you turned your head to the West Mountain and your identity was exposed?

477
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,280
The Jiuhua Sect has been asking me why you are disturbing the Xuan Gate.

478
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,280
I know.

479
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,080
Then why did you go to the West Mountain?

480
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,680
Mu Qingge likes the Southern color.

481
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,880
You were bewitched by her.

482
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,280
I didn't want to kill her for a day.

483
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,880
I was just deceived by her and had to be punished by her.

484
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
What?

485
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,880
You really had a soul-striking?

486
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,480
I thought you were a smart and cautious person.

487
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I didn't know you were a coward. If I had known, I would have killed you.

488
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,080
Father, please don't be angry. I have thought of a plan.

489
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
What?

490
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,880
You are about to become a demon?

491
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,680
Mu Qingge entered the Jiuhua Sect and entered the Mirror of the Unmissable.

492
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,480
I plan to learn from her and enter the Jiuhua Sect to take over the Demon Palace.

493
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
It will be easy.

494
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,680
Father, don't forget.

495
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,480
Even if you risk your life for Mu Qingge's soul-striking,

496
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,680
your life is still in my hands.

497
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,880
Why did you bring me here?

498
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
You will know soon.

499
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,280
You will know soon.

500
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,880
Thank you, Immortal.

501
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
It's easy to say.

502
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Thank you, Immortal, for saving my wife.

503
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
You don't need to thank me.

504
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,880
Thank you, Immortal.

505
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,880
Thank you, Immortal, for finding my son. Thank you, Immortal.

506
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
You are welcome.

507
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Thank you, Immortal.

508
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Thank you, Immortal, for taking my donkey back from the river.

509
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,680
Thank you, Immortal.

510
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
You don't need to thank me.

511
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,080
Mu Qingge, you actually made me earn money.

512
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,480
Why are you in a hurry? There is still a big order to be done.

513
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,880
You are not trying to earn money. You are doing good deeds, right?

514
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,280
I can't hide it from you.

515
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,680
There are thousands of people who need to be saved.

516
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,480
There is no doubt that you are doing good deeds.

517
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,080
It's good to save one person. It's better to have someone than not having one.

518
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,880
Moreover, can you still earn some money?

519
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,280
What's wrong?

520
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,880
Why are you calling your actions like this a demoness?

521
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
These old idiots.

522
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,880
They don't have to work hard to learn.

523
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,480
If the situation is different from them, it's called a evil demon who is a bad person.

524
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
They can learn their own way. It's none of their business.

525
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
I'm leaving.

526
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,880
Save him.

527
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,080
Save him.

528
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,880
Thank you, two of you.

529
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,080
These doors were tied to this pillar for no reason.

530
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,680
Yes.

531
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
There is also a doll.

532
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,280
You need to be good at doing good deeds. Hurry and go.

533
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,680
Don't be afraid. Do you know who made you fall?

534
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
I don't know.

535
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm giving this to my older brother and sister.

536
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Thank you.

537
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Mind your own business.

538
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,480
What's going on?

539
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,880
That child who took the doll away should be a god.

540
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
He gave us a shadow silk, so we were forced to move.

541
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Doing good deeds to save people.

542
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,480
Doing good deeds to save people, but in the end, you hurt yourself.

543
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
It's really funny.

544
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,880
Isn't this quite interesting?

545
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,680
Just seal that god back in the earth and save the doll.

546
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,480
Interesting? Okay.

547
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,680
Don't make such a big move.

548
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,480
Isn't it interesting?

549
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,080
As a god, you're not watching over a small land, but you're causing trouble.

550
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,680
Where else are you going?

551
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,280
Unleash the shadow silk.

552
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,680
You two have come to my area, but you still dare to be arrogant?

553
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
This is...

554
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
The Four Laws of Shadow Clan are not working anymore?

555
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,480
It seems that we were dragged into his prison.

556
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
You know a lot.

557
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
I was locked up here for thousands of years to guard the land.

558
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I was so bored that I finally found a place to hide.

559
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
You guys are causing me trouble.

560
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Then stay here forever.

561
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
You want to die?

562
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Zhe Xian Ice Thorn?

563
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
You're not being kind.

564
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
There's so much space here.

565
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Where do you want to escape?

566
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Let us out.

567
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You want to get out?

568
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
That's fine.

569
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
But there are so many people here.

570
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
You want to escape?

571
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
You want to escape?

572
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
You want to escape?

573
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Fine.

574
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,480
But every place here is sealed by the Immortal.

575
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Once you enter, you must obey.

576
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
My land needs two people to guard it.

577
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
The Immortal Realm is so small that I have to stay here for a thousand years.

578
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Now that you three are here, you can only leave two people.

579
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Leave one.

580
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
What nonsense are you saying?

581
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,480
If you kill me, you will also leave two people here.

582
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
If you're here, you decide for yourself.

583
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Xiao Shui, he didn't lie.

584
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
The Immortal Qi here has indeed restricted us.

585
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
But I have an idea.

586
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
What?

587
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Don't be afraid.

588
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Go home.

589
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Where's that sister?

590
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Sister, you're staying here.

591
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
You're out.

592
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
How did you break the Immortal Qi?

593
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,480
I've been through a lot of trouble with that Immortal.

594
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I couldn't resist until I used my 300 years of cultivation

595
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,480
to get the chance to open the door and get the chance to get the chance to open the door.

596
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
I'm so happy.

597
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I'm so happy.

598
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
I'm so happy.

599
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm so happy.

600
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm so happy.

601
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm so happy.

602
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm so happy.

603
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I'm so happy.

604
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I'm so happy.

605
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm so happy.

606
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Your Highness, this is a gift from the Immortal.

607
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm so happy.

608
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Your Highness, this is a gift from the Immortal.

609
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
You're so kind.

610
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm so happy.

611
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm so happy.

612
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
This is such a rare gift.

613
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I can't believe you bought it on your own.

614
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
I'm so happy.

615
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
I'm so happy.

616
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm so happy.

617
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm so happy.

618
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
What?

619
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Three, two, one.

620
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,960
Shadow Division?

621
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,960
This is what I call troublesome.

622
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,760
After leaving the prison,

623
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,520
the Shadow Division is working again.

624
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,480
How do we solve this thing?

625
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,200
We can only solve it in two hours.

626
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,920
Let's go.

627
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,320
Let's send the girl back to the village.

628
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Come on.

629
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,440
Let's sign the papers.

630
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,120
The Shadow Division

631
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,160
The Shadow Division

632
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,000
The Shadow Division

633
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,520
The Shadow Division

634
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,680
The Shadow Division

635
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,840
Master, you're the master.

636
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Let me drink first.

637
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,480
You love your apprentice the most.

638
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,160
Why don't you let me drink first?

639
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,080
You're being stubborn.

640
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,080
Fine.

641
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,920
Let's see how long you can last.

642
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,120
Be careful.

643
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,280
You...

644
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,000
This...

645
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,320
A woman with a picture of a wolf?

646
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
You're so stubborn.

647
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,440
Let's go.

648
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,440
You're drawing the image of a master.

649
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,480
You're the one who's drawing it.

650
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
Besides, you don't care about others' opinions.

651
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,600
You said I'm a devil.

652
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,120
You can't be a woman with a picture of a wolf.

653
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,040
Stop it.

654
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,280
We're like this.

655
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,240
It's like hurting our enemies and hurting ourselves.

656
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,080
Stop the battle.

657
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,080
Go to the inn after you finish your meal.

658
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,240
Wait for the time.

659
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,400
Didn't you stop the battle?

660
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,120
Why are you still here?

661
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Didn't you say it's been two hours?

662
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,880
I was injured at that time.

663
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,080
Didn't your body steel frame protect you?

664
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,480
Zhe Xian's ice stab is very powerful.

665
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,400
I heard that

666
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
the deviless Mu Qingge

667
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
has never been injured by accident.

668
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,960
Isn't this the first one?

669
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,600
Then let's go to the inn.

670
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,240
Let's go.

671
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,080
I was lucky before.

672
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,720
I'm a good man.

673
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,880
I'm not injured.

674
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,480
It's just a scar.

675
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
What's the harm?

676
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Let me do it.

677
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,960
Lower.

678
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,960
If the moon is full,

679
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,000
if the six years are gone,

680
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,520
I wish I could stay with you like the cloud.

681
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,120
I want to see the world without end,

682
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,080
and I want to keep my promise forever.

683
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,760
I will go through all the hardships.

684
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
A red thread,

685
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,080
a long story.

686
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,960
I can remember all the things in the world.

687
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,640
I love you and I will be with you forever.

688
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,000
You've been tired all day.

689
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,360
I'll go to sleep for a while.

690
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,880
Xiao Shui, go to the town and have a walk.

691
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,320
Don't disturb me.

692
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,800
11 years later

693
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,480
He actually has one curfew at night

694
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,700
Everyone,

695
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,340
find him the east village

696
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,940
He survived

697
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,020
He was larger and tenable

698
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,020
from his father to his sister

699
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,820
I'll be with Xifeng

700
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,580
any future difficulties

701
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,620
No

702
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,780
Taking him to West Campus

703
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,860
I can't

704
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,960
Hong holier

705
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,320
Is my brother

706
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm not afraid of the world with you

707
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,320
If love has me, I'm willing to give my life

708
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I'm willing to be with you

709
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I hope that you can be with me

710
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,320
I hope that you can be with me

711
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,320
I hope that you can be with me

712
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,320
I hope that you can be with me

713
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,320
I hope that you can be with me

714
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,320
I hope that you can be with me

715
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,320
I hope that you can be with me

716
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,320
I hope that you can be with me

717
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,320
I hope that you can be with me

718
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,320
I hope that you can be with me

719
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,320
I hope that you can be with me

720
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,320
I hope that you can be with me

721
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,320
If love has me, I'm willing to give my life

722
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,320
I'm willing to be with you

723
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,320
I hope that you can be with me

724
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,320
I hope that you can be with me

725
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I hope that you can be with me

726
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,920
I'll only miss you for the rest of my life.
