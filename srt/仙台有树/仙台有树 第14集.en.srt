[Grand Hall]

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
The Guardian has gone down the mountain for business.

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,050
Has he already left?

6
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,170
Didn't we just get guests?

7
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,280
I even made some delicious food.

8
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,630
He said we should go down the mountain for experience

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,960
and accumulate merits.

10
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,110
But where exactly should we go?

11
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,710
Master left without giving any instructions.

12
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,100
Ranran,

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,090
where do you think we should go?

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
No way,

15
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,250
direct disciples

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,480
can't just be all show and no substance.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,760
Don't you have any plans in mind?

18
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,630
How about we go to a place

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,030
with beautiful scenery?

20
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,150
The other day, the Paired Wings Auspicious Cloud

21
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,000
was in the sky from morning until noon.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,130
It was so beautiful.

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,520
Let's go to a place with such beautiful scenery.

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
The Paired Wings Auspicious Cloud?

25
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,960
Didn't it only appear for a moment

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,310
before being covered by other clouds?

27
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,910
Not at all.

28
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,750
I specially brought over a chair

29
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,810
and watched it outside for half a day.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
You saw it too?

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,870
Yes.

32
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,430
The auspicious clouds from the other day were so big,

33
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,520
just like a pair of birds flying wing to wing.

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,079
Many lovers must've

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,370
confessed their love successfully under those clouds.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,930
Why did I see something different?

37
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,750
Unless

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,170
someone used a Smokescreen on you.

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,120
But on our mountain,

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
there are only a few of us.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,220
Who would use such tactics on you?

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
You must have seen it wrong yourself.

43
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Could it be that Master noticed

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,310
my feelings for him

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
and deliberately wanted to discourage me?

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,770
Ranran,

47
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,040
why are you so jumpy?

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,520
I...

49
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,110
I'm tired of sitting.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,490
I'll take a walk.

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,470
If

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,950
Master is deliberately avoiding me...

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,730
Then that time when the rocks collapsed,

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,000
the sword energy that protected me must have been from Master.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,910
Ever since I was affected by the Peach Blossom Intoxication last time,

56
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,110
Master has been avoiding me for so long.

57
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,040
He didn't even show up to save me

58
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,590
and deliberately covered up the auspicious clouds.

59
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,630
Paired Wings Auspicious Cloud,

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,960
please listen to my wish.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,220
With Master, I hope...

62
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,870
What does this mean?

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,080
It means...

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Did Master

65
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,240
lose his focus too?

66
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,680
It must be so.

67
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,600
It seems I wasn't the only one who lost composure last time.

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,459
Master did too.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,750
Even the Unfeeling Mantra can be shaken.

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,960
Learn from this lesson.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,870
Next time, I absolutely can't

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,750
be so impulsive

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
to avoid scaring Master away again.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,659
Xue Ranran,

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
keep up the effort!

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,050
You still have a chance!

77
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,120
Ranran.

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Why are you

79
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,030
hiding over there laughing?

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
Of course I'm happy to go down

81
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,210
the mountain for experience and good deeds!

82
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,270
As you ordered,

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,430
I will make sure Xue Ranran and Su Yishui

84
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,450
get entangled with each other.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,430
This way,

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
we can discover the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
May I ask if you are

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,070
the Immortal Masters from Mount Wester?

89
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,930
Indeed, we are.

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,050
That's wonderful!

91
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,040
We've been waiting for Immortal Masters

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,430
to come down from Mount Wester.

93
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,240
Recently,

94
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,560
there have been soldiers

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
dying in the river where I fish.

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,840
Moreover,

97
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,870
their deaths are mysterious.

98
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,800
I beg you, Immortal Masters, to investigate.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,260
I hope it's not some kind of

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,040
evil creature harming people.

101
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
We were just looking for a place to gain experience.

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,170
What a coincidence!

103
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
Sir, where is

104
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,180
this fishing spot?

105
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,590
Wangxiang Pass.

106
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,270
We got it.

107
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,920
We will definitely go there.

108
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Thank you very much, Immortal Masters.

109
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,190
There's hope now!

110
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,390
There's hope now!

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,330
But to investigate the soldiers' deaths,

112
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,730
we need to enter the camp.

113
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,950
However, we can't

114
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,750
just enter the military camp

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,750
without a reason.

116
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,950
How does the Wangxiang Pass camp

117
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,190
have such strange occurrences?

118
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,870
We were just about to

119
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,120
go there to entertain the troops.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
That's right!

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
We four illusionists

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
have prepared some amazing tricks.

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,940
Yes, indeed.

124
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,720
We were hoping to earn some extra money.

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,110
Now with these strange events,

126
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,170
should we still go?

127
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,750
Yes,

128
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,630
troupe leader, should we still go?

129
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,960
Yes, should we still go?

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,690
This couldn't have worked out better.

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
You've been staring

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,410
at this compass for a while now.

133
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,210
What's the situation?

134
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,750
Su Yishui,

135
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,830
I'm talking to you.

136
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,830
Where are you going?

137
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,270
There's a demonic aura on the compass.

138
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,000
I need to consult the Earth Immortal of this area.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,560
Ranran,

140
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,310
we're going to disguise ourselves as illusionists to enter the military camp.

141
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,440
Won't we be exposed?

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,190
Soldiers are disappearing.

143
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,190
The officers fear it will demoralize the troops, so they're keeping it quiet.

144
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,870
This is our only way

145
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,159
to continue the investigation.

146
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,830
Don't worry.

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,360
It'll be fine.

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,890
Let's go.

149
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,570
Let's go.

150
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,390
This is the morgue?

151
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,060
Why are there so many salted fish here?

152
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,290
Are we in the wrong place?

153
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,120
They need to hide the bodies of the newly deceased soldiers.

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,980
Naturally, they use salted fish to mask the smell.

155
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,630
This is the place.

156
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,160
Let's go.

157
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,580
The corpses have turned pale from being soaked in water.

158
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,600
They have such large holes in their stomachs.

159
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,530
It must be the work of evil sorcery.

160
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,450
Here.

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
There's a demonic aura.

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,140
So it's the work of a demon.

163
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,270
What good does knowing all this do?

164
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,000
Anything can turn into a demon.

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,370
We still have no leads to investigate.

166
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,430
I have a way to see that demon.

167
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,310
Using the Seeing Sunflower

168
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,160
to trace what the corpse saw before death.

169
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,090
Ranran, you're really something.

170
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,480
I saw it.

171
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,870
The deceased was being controlled

172
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,080
and walked towards the riverbank.

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
There really was a demon behind him.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,120
That monster

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,970
was completely black,

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,650
shaped like a tiger or leopard.

177
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,580
Senior Gao Cang,

178
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,720
your hometown is not far from Wangxiang Pass.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,650
Are there such fierce beasts here?

180
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,960
Wangxiang Pass

181
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,600
had many casualties after the great battle of Fan Yao.

182
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,670
The netherworld opened up over a decade ago

183
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,960
and evil energy invaded again.

184
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,160
Add to that the years of border warfare,

185
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,910
and a Death Realm formed

186
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,030
not far from here.

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
Death Realm?

188
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,390
Yes,

189
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,870
it's a valley filled with corpses.

190
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,000
It's very sinister.

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,080
The entire Wangxiang Pass has become

192
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,440
barren of birds and beasts along with it.

193
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Livestock can hardly survive.

194
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,080
There aren't even any wild game to catch.

195
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,970
Fortunately, there are plenty of fish in the river.

196
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,120
So if the nearby residents

197
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
want to eat meat,

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,220
they can only eat fish.

199
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm certain that the huge beast you mentioned

200
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,360
can't exist here.

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
That beast

202
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,290
had one yellow eye

203
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,270
and one blue eye.

204
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,830
If not a fierce beast,

205
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,100
it seemed more like...

206
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,550
A cat?

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Perhaps that demon

208
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,210
is hiding in the military camp.

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
Let's split up and look around.

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
There must be some clues.

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
-Okay.
-Okay.

212
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,390
I use my blood

213
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,200
to summon the Earth Immortal of this place.

214
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Come to me!

215
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,440
Who dares to summon me?

216
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,590
It's you!

217
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,740
Over there.

218
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,600
Such a powerful earth energy fluctuation.

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,790
In the military camp,

220
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,480
there's suddenly such a strong disturbance.

221
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
It must be that demon.

222
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,320
Let's go.

223
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,630
Quick, follow me.

224
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,020
There's a demon in the camp.

225
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,810
Aren't you

226
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,600
the illusionists invited to entertain the troops?

227
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,730
I'll explain later.

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,080
Come with me to catch the demon.

229
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Hurry.

230
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,400
Let's go.

231
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,870
Follow me.

232
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,410
You, you, you...

233
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,700
More than a decade ago,

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,380
you stole the playmate I found

235
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,640
and that damned girl

236
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,840
forced me to lose 300 years of cultivation.

237
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,770
Now you have the nerve to summon me?

238
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,630
There are evil spirits running rampant here.

239
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,000
According to Heavenly rules,

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,750
as a cultivator,

241
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,270
I can summon the Earth Immortal of this place to inquire.

242
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm not listening.

243
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,240
I don't care to listen.

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,390
I sacrificed a drop of my essence blood

245
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,670
to set up this Spirit Dispelling Formation.

246
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,870
It's precisely to deal with uncooperative ones like you.

247
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,910
Since that's the case,

248
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll send you to the subordinate position.

249
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,100
I'll take the main position

250
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,750
and then command you to follow me to find the demon.

251
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,410
You have no choice but to obey.

252
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,330
How dare you!

253
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,020
Shameless!

254
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,030
What demon is it?

255
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,580
M-Master!

256
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,450
Silly girl!

257
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
You're here too?

258
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,030
I'll leave

259
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,770
this Spirit Dispelling Formation for you two to play with.

260
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,300
Goodbye.

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,670
This strange and ghostly thing

262
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,670
is indeed a demon.

263
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,320
And it's a pretty boy demon at that.

264
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:46,990
Catch him!

265
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,080
It's a misunderstanding.

266
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,280
A misunderstanding!

267
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,020
Young lady,

268
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,050
weren't you the one who wanted to catch demons?

269
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,600
This...

270
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,000
This is a warm-up act.

271
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,490
This gentleman here

272
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,090
is our

273
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,580
most famous illusionist.

274
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,970
What everyone just saw

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,260
was his warm-up trick.

276
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
That's right, that's right.

277
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,370
Everyone, please wait a bit for the main show.

278
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,010
Put away your swords first.

279
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,410
She already said it was a warm-up.

280
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,310
Disperse now.

281
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,750
Yes.

282
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,930
You are disciples from Mount Wester?

283
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,110
Yes.

284
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,760
May I ask who you are?

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,790
Qin Xuanjiu.

286
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,670
You're the one our founder

287
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,010
took as her last disciple.

288
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,140
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

289
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,300
So you're Su Yishui's disciples.

290
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,130
As expected, you're causing trouble.

291
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,000
You're playing tricks

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
to sneak into my military camp.

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
What are you up to?

294
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,670
Aren't there soldiers in the camp

295
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,980
who died mysteriously?

296
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,030
We came down the mountain to gain experience

297
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,510
and happened to investigate this case.

298
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,750
I've tried so hard to conceal this matter.

299
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,350
How did you find out about it?

300
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,790
Evil spirits hide well,

301
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,050
so of course we had to inquire carefully.

302
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,450
I detected

303
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,610
a trace of demonic aura on the corpses.

304
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,080
There's no need to investigate.

305
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
Go somewhere else for your training.

306
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,570
Leave immediately.

307
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,910
Why not investigate such a strange occurrence?

308
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,030
Why do we need to go elsewhere,

309
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,510
Master?

310
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,930
Since when do I

311
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
need to explain myself to you?

312
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,300
Still not leaving?

313
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,390
We're not leaving.

314
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,240
Master, you can't just make me leave like this.

315
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,840
Is that so?

316
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
Master?

317
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,850
Give me some water.

318
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,720
Xue Ranran!

319
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,140
The Spirit Dispelling Formation

320
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,720
had the positions of master and subordinate reversed.

321
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I stepped on the master's position

322
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,840
and you stepped on the subordinate's position,

323
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,510
didn't you?

324
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,240
Yes.

325
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,900
No more questions.

326
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,540
Master,

327
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,670
this isn't my fault.

328
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,360
Since things have come to this,

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,030
I want to investigate the case

330
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,000
and you can't drive me away,

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,480
so

332
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,750
you have no choice but to let me stay

333
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,480
by your side.

334
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,600
You're an interesting little girl.

335
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,460
Stay here then.

336
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,440
Seeing Su Yishui at a loss

337
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,150
really makes me feel good.

338
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,390
However,

339
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,910
when I asked Su Yishui earlier

340
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,970
about the compass,

341
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,960
he mentioned demonic aura.

342
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,420
You also detected demonic aura, didn't you?

343
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
What kind of demonic aura

344
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,460
did you detect?

345
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,840
Is the demon that killed the soldiers

346
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,790
the same one

347
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,120
that broke the compass?

348
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,630
Mr. Qin,

349
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,720
do you have any cats in your camp?

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,450
There is one.

351
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,490
A stray I found.

352
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,850
It's wild in nature,

353
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,620
but Coal is thin and weak.

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,050
It's nothing like a demon.

355
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,440
Then are there scratches

356
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,100
on your arm?

357
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,690
Coal scratched me.

358
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,570
What's the matter?

359
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,580
Now this is interesting.

360
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,790
Ranran!

361
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,930
-Master.
-Master.

362
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
Let's talk about this later.

363
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,440
It seems we really

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
need to perform some illusions now.

365
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,670
It was them just now

366
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,670
who warmed up the crowd with illusions.

367
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,800
It was quite a sight.

368
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,600
We're waiting for

369
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,370
your main performance now.

370
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,360
Mr. Qin.

371
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,210
This...

372
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,030
The commotion just now was too big.

373
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,630
I can't cover this up.

374
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,670
You guys,

375
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,360
figure out how to deal with it yourselves.

376
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
I'm going to watch the main show.

377
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,440
Ranran.

378
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,830
What should we do now?

379
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,430
I have an idea.

380
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,190
Gentlemen,

381
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,870
want to see some magic tricks?

382
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,320
Easy.

383
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,790
However, for the next performance,

384
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,390
I'll need your cooperation.

385
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,610
As long as it's good,

386
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,910
we're willing to do whatever

387
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,840
you want us to do.

388
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,440
Right?

389
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,030
Yes, yes, yes.

390
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Everyone,

391
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,260
raise your hands high.

392
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,240
What's this?

393
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,750
Let's just do as she says. Then what?

394
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,270
Like this.

395
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,880
Raise it up.

396
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,349
Like this?

397
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:07,960
We've raised them.

398
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,920
Why are you making us raise our hands?

399
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,270
Yeah.

400
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,020
Don't tell me

401
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,950
it's to catch an embroidered ball

402
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,950
for matchmaking?

403
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,150
Don't be impatient.

404
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
This performance

405
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,349
guarantees that all of you

406
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,000
will have good luck in love.

407
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,349
Really?

408
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,109
Great!

409
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,349
I can't wait anymore.

410
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,260
How magical!

411
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,690
There really are peach blossoms.

412
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,550
Yes, it's beautiful.

413
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,150
It's true.

414
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,830
These peach blossoms.

415
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,680
are getting bigger!

416
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,340
Look, look!

417
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,000
Amazing, and there are more and more!

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,680
Is that all?

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,270
What's happening?

420
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,920
Why did they disappear?

421
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,780
Are there more?

422
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,270
Yeah.

423
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh no.

424
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,770
Ranran's spiritual power is insufficient.

425
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,620
This is bad.

426
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,750
I just used the Seeing Sunflower.

427
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,410
The spiritual power consumption was too great.

428
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,510
Look!

429
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,140
It got bigger, bigger!

430
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,820
It got bigger, bigger!

431
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
It's even bigger!

432
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,000
Look!

433
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,180
It's amazing!

434
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,830
So beautiful!

435
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,720
So beautiful!

436
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,440
I want one, I want one!

437
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,770
-I want one.
-I want one.

438
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
I want one too!

439
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,970
There are peach blossoms!

440
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,710
Don't fight, there's enough for everyone!

441
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,820
I have some too!

442
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,200
Look how many I have!

443
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,370
Look, look at me!

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,130
How many do you have?

445
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,030
Amazing!

446
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,030
Bottoms up!

447
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,230
Come on, let's drink!

448
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,790
Come on, come on!

449
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,310
Ranran.

450
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:29,970
Mr. Qin.

451
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,310
What's the real reason behind

452
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,040
asking me to host this banquet?

453
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,440
Of course it's to mingle and investigate the case.

454
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
Investigate?

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,660
Come, come!

456
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,430
Come, let's drink together!

457
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,400
Well, do as you see fit.

458
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Pour him a drink!

459
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,260
You drink with him.

460
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,750
Come, come!

461
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,420
Come on!

462
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,170
Keep drinking!

463
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,440
Master,

464
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,230
I'll go over there first.

465
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,920
Come on, bottoms up, bottoms up!

466
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,580
Come on, drink, drink, drink!

467
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,480
Gentlemen.

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,930
Come on, come on!

469
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,220
Alright, thank you.

470
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,340
Let's play finger-guessing!

471
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,340
Young lady,

472
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,640
Drinking and playing finger-guessing now

473
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,770
have become boring.

474
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,970
We play cards while drinking now.

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,330
Immortal Master cards.

476
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,240
Immortal Kaiyuan?

477
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,350
That's right.

478
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,640
All the famous immortal masters

479
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,270
are engraved on the back.

480
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,750
Draw cards and compare their ranks.

481
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
The loser drinks.

482
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,750
We can bask in the aura of immortals

483
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,350
and have fun at the same time.

484
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,820
Come on.

485
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,660
Let's play a round together.

486
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,590
Let's play a round.

487
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,120
Alright.

488
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Yan Liangyu, the senior disciple of Eternal Sect.

489
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,510
I play the female Immortal Master of Hollow Sect,

490
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,440
Wen Hongshan.

491
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,120
It's higher than yours.

492
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,550
Eternal Sect is the top Heavenly sect in the universe.

493
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,070
And Yan Liangyu is the senior disciple.

494
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,070
How can your Wen Hongshan be higher?

495
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,070
Well, Immortal Master Yan has feelings for Immortal Master Wen.

496
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,430
With love in his heart,

497
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,520
he's naturally under her control.

498
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,490
Well...

499
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,590
That makes sense.

500
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,880
I play the sovereign of Scud Sect,

501
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,690
Lu Yun.

502
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,790
A sect sovereign!

503
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,530
There can't be anyone higher than him, right?

504
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,710
Sovereign Su Yishui of the Wester Sect.

505
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,510
Even the four major Heavenly sects can't match him.

506
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,000
My card is the highest.

507
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,360
You all

508
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,860
better get ready to drink.

509
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,790
You just got lucky.

510
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,200
You even managed to draw

511
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,880
a monster card like Su Yishui.

512
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:24,680
Young lady.

513
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,540
It's your turn.

514
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,180
With Su Yishui already drawn,

515
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,380
I guess you're not far from having to drink as punishment.

516
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,640
I won, I won!

517
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,830
The one I drew is

518
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
Sovereign Su's master,

519
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,510
Mu Qingge.

520
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Time to drink!

521
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,000
Alright, alright.

522
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,030
I'll drink, come on.

523
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,510
Come on, come on!

524
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,110
Alright, alright, let's go!

525
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,790
I've heard there are many strange happenings at Wangxiang Pass.

526
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,270
Has there been anything strange recently?

527
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,330
Tell me about them.

528
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,080
Speaking of strange things,

529
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,350
isn't it our mean captain

530
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,250
treating us all to drinks?

531
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,070
Right.

532
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,270
It's a pity those patrol brothers

533
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,590
missed out on this

534
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,070
once-in-a-century fun.

535
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Haven't seen him come back yet.

536
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,560
Wonder what kind of tough assignment it is.

537
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Do those on patrol

538
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,160
have anything in common?

539
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,350
Not much,

540
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,230
but those who go on patrol

541
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,400
all come from the Elite Armored Guard.

542
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,680
Come on.

543
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,510
Young lady, you're really good

544
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,200
at cards.

545
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,830
Winning every round

546
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,830
is so boring.

547
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,110
Besides,

548
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,310
you're so pretty.

549
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,070
Why don't you drink

550
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,270
with us two?

551
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,340
That's right.

552
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,030
The rule at the table is

553
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,360
you drink when you lose.

554
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,120
Won't drink with us?

555
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,370
If you won't,

556
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,260
then you'll have to keep us company with your smile.

557
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Gentlemen,

558
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,610
have you had too much to drink and fallen?

559
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,190
Put away your swords first.

560
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,070
How about this?

561
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,930
I'll toast you both a bowl of wine.

562
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,790
Have you forgotten that after you drink,

563
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,190
plants will grow wildly?

564
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,920
One bowl won't hurt.

565
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,360
We need to investigate the case after all.

566
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,440
Master,

567
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,920
your alcohol tolerance...

568
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm fine.

569
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,240
A great drinker!

570
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,010
Goodbye.

571
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,740
Did Master

572
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,270
drink on my behalf?

573
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,110
As soon as the Spirit Spring stirred,

574
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,840
you, Su Yishui, indeed eagerly

575
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,320
rushed to Wangxiang Pass.

576
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,440
It seems

577
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,880
I don't need to work hard.

578
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,230
Waiting to reap the benefits is enough.

579
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,190
Mr. Qin.

580
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,400
We don't keep outsiders in the military camp.

581
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,860
Follow me to stay at an inn.

582
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,550
But

583
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,400
Master hasn't woken up yet.

584
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,680
Don't look at me.

585
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,170
He's your master.

586
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,030
I don't care.

587
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,460
I'm sorry, Master.

588
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,960
Get up.

589
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,750
Okay.

590
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,140
Su Yishui, Su Yishui.

591
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,350
You deserve this.

592
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,730
Ranran.

593
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,400
Ranran.

594
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,820
If Master finds out

595
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
after he wakes up,

596
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,710
you're definitely in for it.

597
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,780
[Madam Wu's Inn]

598
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,830
Godmother.

599
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,500
Godmother.

600
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,280
[Owner: Madam Wu]

601
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,510
Xuanjiu,

602
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,950
are you

603
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,030
bringing friends to stay at the inn?

604
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,940
A friend who gets drunk after one cup.

605
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,510
This is the inn run by my godmother.

606
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,510
You can stay here.

607
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,410
Put it on my tab.

608
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,350
When your Master came down the mountain,

609
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,960
he was in such a hurry, as if fleeing from the plague.

610
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,760
It's possible

611
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,430
he didn't even bring money.

612
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,310
Master was in a great hurry to come down the mountain?

613
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,880
Yes,

614
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,440
he was in such a rush, as if he was on fire.

615
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,350
Since you're Xuanjiu's friends,

616
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,640
you're like family.

617
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,720
Please make yourselves at home.

618
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,650
Please, come in.

619
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,080
Let's go.

620
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,010
Mr. Qin said you were in a hurry to come down the mountain.

621
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,920
Why?

622
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,550
Could it be that you really knew

623
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,550
about my feelings

624
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,320
and rushed down to avoid me?

625
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
He avoids me

626
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,560
but can't help being nice to me.

627
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,680
I must find a way

628
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,660
to see through Master.

629
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,880
Master,

630
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,150
you're awake?

631
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,580
After a year of cultivation,

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,170
you've made quite some progress.

633
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,950
You've learned to oppose me at every turn.

634
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,240
Do you really think that I can't send you away

635
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,640
because you have the Spirit Dispelling Charm?

636
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,410
Master,

637
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,790
I didn't intentionally

638
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,250
step into that formation.

639
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,960
I didn't mean to make you angry.

640
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm also investigating the mysterious case at Wangxiang Pass.

641
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,200
If I give up halfway like this

642
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,270
an can't accumulate virtue,

643
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,400
it would be a shame.

644
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,550
Master,

645
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,350
I specially

646
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,640
made some delicious food for you.

647
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,370
Please try it

648
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,240
and calm down.

649
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,950
Please taste it, Master.

650
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,880
Xue Ranran.

651
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
It's delicious, isn't it?

652
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,360
This is my newly developed almond crackers.

653
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,560
It's all based on

654
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,750
your taste preferences.

655
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,680
Whichever dish you took an extra bite of,

656
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,310
whichever soup you had an extra spoonful of,

657
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,350
I remembered it all.

658
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,750
It must suit your palate.

659
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,110
So, Master,

660
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,310
considering how much effort I've put into this,

661
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,510
please let me stay.

662
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,790
You're only allowed to stay until the Spirit Dispelling Formation

663
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,960
loses its power.

664
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,810
Thank you, Master.

665
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,580
Master,

666
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,310
there's one thing I don't understand.

667
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,350
Why did that Earth Immortal know me?

668
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,880
Is it

669
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,490
related to my past life?

670
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,030
Since you've already said it's about your past life,

671
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,760
why ask more?

672
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,100
But when I entered the small vine,

673
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
in my memories,

674
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,710
I saw

675
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,130
that the vine master wanted to kill me.

676
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,050
Your memories

677
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,850
are indeed starting to recover.

678
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,920
Master,

679
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,690
was I a bad person in my past life?

680
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,160
No.

681
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,870
You were very good.

682
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,830
How good?

683
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,920
I've said there's no need to ask again.

684
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,850
Perhaps you want to settle

685
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,930
the score for your disrespect today

686
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,530
all at once

687
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,080
and punish you properly?

688
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,550
Fine, I won't ask.

689
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,270
Anyway, you can't hit me

690
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,200
with your ruler.

691
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,200
Mr. Qin.

692
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,750
You get drunk quickly

693
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,880
but sober up slowly.

694
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,640
Have you found anything?

695
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
May I ask if your cat

696
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,560
has injured one of its paws?

697
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,090
How do you know that?

698
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,150
You have three long and

699
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,640
one short scratch marks.

700
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,270
It must be from a cat with an injured paw.

701
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,680
I just saw that quite a few people

702
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,280
in the camp

703
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,910
have similar scratch marks.

704
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,650
In my camp,

705
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
there's only one cat.

706
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,330
When everyone plays with it,

707
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,270
they get scratched.

708
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,680
What's so strange about that?

709
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,350
The scratch marks

710
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,720
on those dead soldiers,

711
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,290
though larger in size,

712
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,300
are also three long and one short.

713
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,550
If that monster

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,330
also has an injured paw,

715
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
it would be too much of a coincidence.

716
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
Combined with the merging of demonic aura,

717
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
we can deduce that

718
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,830
your cat

719
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
is most likely a demon.

720
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,660
It can't be.

721
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,350
I've raised Coal for so many years.

722
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,400
It wouldn't harm anyone.

723
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,200
The disappearance of soldiers in the camp

724
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,000
has only happened in the past six months.

725
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,130
If Coal were a demon,

726
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,380
why didn't it act earlier?

727
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,830
Even if we take a step back,

728
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,920
if it wanted to harm people,

729
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,830
there are so many people in my camp.

730
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,430
Why would it specifically go to the riverside?

731
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,910
Becoming a demon

732
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,880
and harming people are not the same thing.

733
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,830
You're right.

734
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,510
Becoming a demon and harming people are not the same thing.

735
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,110
The cat being a demon is certain,

736
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,360
but whether it will harm people

737
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,830
is another matter to consider.

738
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,890
Thank you, Master.

739
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,160
Mr. Qin,

740
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,550
take this demon-revealing talisman.

741
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,070
When you see the cat, stick it on it.

742
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,920
Whether it's a demon or not

743
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,450
will be immediately clear.

744
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,850
If it's all for nothing,

745
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,370
you don't need to concern yourselves

746
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,650
with the affairs in my camp tomorrow.

747
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,620
Ranran,

748
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,350
you just said that harming people and becoming a demon

749
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,310
are not the same thing.

750
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,200
Then what about harming people?

751
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,360
How do we investigate that?

752
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,350
During my performance,

753
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,880
I used the conjured peach blossom petals

754
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
to place a Spirit-tracking Spell

755
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,200
on every soldier in the camp.

756
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,790
Whether the culprit is the cat or not,

757
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,000
if it likes to control people

758
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,330
to kill them by the river,

759
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,640
then once a soldier falls under its spell,

760
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,570
this tree branch

761
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,830
will help us go there

762
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,760
and catch it.

763
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,290
Master, where are you going?

764
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,490
Just focus on investigating your case.

765
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,610
There's a faint trace of resentment.

766
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,500
I couldn't sense it

767
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,560
without approaching the riverside.

768
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,320
The compass was damaged by demonic aura.

769
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,570
But there's resentment in this river.

770
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,440
Maybe I can find something

771
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,370
by investigating the resentment.

772
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,550
Coal.

773
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I'll give it a try.

774
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,450
It's also to shut others up.

775
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,200
I knew it.

776
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,410
How could Coal possibly be a demon?

777
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,710
[Madam Wu's Inn]

778
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,030
Su Yishui!

779
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,350
Su Yishui!

780
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,680
Su Yishui!

781
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,750
Mr. Qin?

782
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,700
Where's Su Yishui?

783
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,310
Master went out last night.

784
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,070
Mr. Qin, what's the urgent matter?

785
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,550
I...

786
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,440
Mr. Qin,

787
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,940
did the black cat touch the demon-detecting talisman?

788
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,560
It turned into a huge creature.

789
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,030
But it didn't hurt anyone.

790
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,350
Coal didn't hurt anyone.

791
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,110
Mr. Qin,

792
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,550
it has revealed its true form.

793
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,960
How can you still say it won't hurt anyone?

794
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,590
If I say it won't, then it won't.

795
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,000
I—

796
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,830
Xuanjiu.

797
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,550
It's so early in the morning.

798
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,830
What are you shouting about?

799
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,490
Godmother,

800
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,440
I got anxious.

801
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,790
Don't argue with your friends.

802
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,070
Come down,

803
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,710
it's time for breakfast.

804
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,980
Let's eat and talk.

805
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,720
Come on...

806
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,000
If you were any later,

807
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,030
you wouldn't get any.

808
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,830
This is the last batch for today.

809
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,030
Lucky you.

810
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,940
The buns made by my godmother

811
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,200
are the best in Wangxiang Pass.

812
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,110
My bros and I

813
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,570
often come for the buns.

814
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,110
Stop bragging about this for me.

815
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,070
Enjoy your meal.

816
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,030
Ranran,

817
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,720
you can have the porridge.

818
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,240
I'll ask my godmother to make some more tomorrow.

819
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,800
Mr. Qin,

820
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
may I ask

821
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,000
why Madam Wu is your godmother?

822
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,070
Madam Wu

823
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,200
is the mother

824
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
of my comrade.

825
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,750
Unfortunately, he died during patrol

826
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,880
and can't come back.

827
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,840
Since I've also lost my mom,

828
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,260
it's not bad to have

829
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,650
a godmother.

830
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,550
Ranran,

831
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,510
does your demon-revelation talisman

832
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,239
really work?

833
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,400
Could it be malfunctioning?

834
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,070
No way.

835
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,840
But it might not be what killed

836
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,639
the soldiers.

837
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,480
Really?

838
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,110
The black cat was sleeping peacefully in Mr. Qin's room,

839
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,880
but the Spirit-tracking Spell showed no response.

840
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,630
This indicates that nothing happened.

841
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,230
Moreover,

842
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,320
those forced to reveal their true forms by that talisman

843
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
will surely run wild

844
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,940
and unleash their beastly nature.

845
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,540
But right in front of Mr. Qin,

846
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,530
the black cat just ran away.

847
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,710
It means it suppressed its animal nature.

848
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,760
It doesn't seem like a harmful monster.

849
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
So none of those possibilities

850
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
make sense.

851
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,280
What now?

852
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,639
Just wait without doing anything?

853
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,050
We just need to wait.

854
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,880
Wait until someone else in the camp is bewitched.

855
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,630
It will surely activate my Spirit-tracking Spell.

856
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,320
Then

857
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,210
everything will become clear.

858
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,530
Something's wrong.

859
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,190
Another soldier in the camp has been bewitched

860
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,110
and left the camp.

861
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,280
Follow the Peach Blossom

862
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,880
and we'll definitely find

863
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
that evil demon.

864
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,440
But

865
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,110
Master hasn't returned yet.

866
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,230
How can we wait for

867
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,580
such an urgent matter?

868
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
It's alright.

869
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,690
It's definitely not Coal.

870
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,070
There's the soldier who has been bewitched.

871
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,470
The evil demon is nearby.

872
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Once it appears,

873
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,400
we'll form the Four Qi Condensation Formation,

874
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,260
and I'll be the formation's core.

875
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,650
Wake up.

876
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,450
Do you hear

877
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,410
a strange sound?

878
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,630
What sound?

879
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,410
You don't hear that?

880
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,370
It's like

881
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
the sound of a river flowing by my ears,

882
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,530
and it's very close.

883
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,880
Try covering your ears.

884
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,320
It doesn't work.

885
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
It sounds like

886
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,320
it's coming out of my head.

887
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,320
Form the formation.

888
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,270
No, wait.

889
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,450
Xue Ranran,

890
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,800
form the formation.

891
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,510
If the cat demon wanted to kill,

892
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,570
it wouldn't need to come to the riverside.

893
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,320
Something's not right.

894
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,800
You...

895
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,150
Transform Kun into Qian and exchange Kan for Li.

896
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,810
I'll be the formation's core.

897
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,920
This is Master's spiritual power.

898
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,800
This branch

899
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,320
will help us get there

900
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,070
and catch it.

901
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,490
Master added immortal power to protect us.

902
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,450
The resentment

903
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
went to Ranran.

904
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,550
Xi'er.

905
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,540
This is bad.

906
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,550
If I protect myself,

907
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,080
I won't be able to save them.

908
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,070
One wisp of qi

909
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,560
to break the galaxy!

910
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,260
One Wisp of Qi to Break the Galaxy.

911
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,230
Someone just used the "One Wisp of Qi to Break the Galaxy"

912
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,300
to extract my spiritual power

913
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,360
along with the Soul-Devouring Lock.

914
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,240
She's really still alive.

915
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,030
Qingge...

916
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,840
You just won't leave me alone.

917
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,840
Everything in this life

918
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,350
must be mine.

919
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,440
Are you hurt?

920
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm just a bit weak.

921
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,280
It's nothing.

922
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,570
This technique...

923
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,190
you learned it from the Vine's consciousness,

924
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,850
didn't you?

925
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,160
You'll gradually remember

926
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,190
everything from the past, right?

927
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,230
Don't use

928
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,550
this technique again in the future.

929
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,880
Isn't it a technique

930
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,080
I used in my past life?

931
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,480
All magical techniques

932
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,030
depend on the practitioner.

933
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,600
Your current cultivation is not enough.

934
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,670
Using this technique that borrows external power

935
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,480
will harm you.

936
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,890
External power?

937
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,390
Where did I borrow external power from?

938
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,320
You only need to know

939
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,340
that before forming your Golden Core,

940
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,880
you're not allowed to use it again.

941
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,460
Also,

942
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
don't mention anything you saw

943
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,000
in the Vine to others.

944
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,690
Understood.

945
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,610
What just happened?

946
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,410
Where did all those fish go?

947
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
The fish demon was injured and fled.

948
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,360
Master.

949
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,900
It was a half-human, half-fish demon

950
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,290
controlling the school of fish.

951
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,110
Demons are bound by the laws of nature.

952
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,770
They can never transform into human form.

953
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,360
How could there be

954
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
a half-human, half-fish creature?

955
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,360
Ranran,

956
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,330
you must have seen it wrong.

957
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,230
I saw it clearly

958
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,320
when I fought it.

959
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,040
I couldn't be mistaken.

960
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,960
Moreover...

961
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
It's human blood.

962
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,030
This doesn't make sense.

963
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,360
Resentment?

964
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,080
That's right.

965
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,400
What's on that fish monster isn't demonic aura,

966
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,330
but resentment.

967
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,480
At least we were right about one thing.

968
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,670
The fish demon harmed people,

969
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,800
while the cat demon was saving people.

970
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,870
That cat demon

971
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,340
did indeed shield us from a calamity.

972
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,760
The cat demon had already discovered

973
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,630
the truth about the fish demon harming people long ago.

974
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,900
Each time it rushed to the riverside,

975
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,710
it was trying to wake up

976
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,310
the soldiers under control.

977
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,960
That's why there were

978
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
scratch marks left on the deceased.

979
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,000
Then the strange bell sound we heard—

980
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,200
was it the fish demon's evil technique?

981
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,770
It was also resentment.

982
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,660
When did we also get affected by the resentment?

983
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,170
How come Ranran is fine?

984
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
We've always been together.

985
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,820
The only difference is...

986
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,670
The steamed buns.

987
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,330
It's the steamed buns.

988
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,710
Mr. Qin said

989
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,800
the soldiers in the camp also loved eating steamed buns.

990
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,360
If the resentment

991
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,190
was infused into the buns before they were eaten,

992
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,190
strange water sounds

993
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,360
would ring in their ears,

994
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,510
controlling them to walk to the riverside.

995
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,590
If there's something wrong with those buns,

996
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,000
then wouldn't that mean...

997
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,030
Let's wake up the soldier

998
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,030
and ask him first.

999
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,150
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

1000
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,280
Half-human, half-fish...

1001
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,140
Resentment...

1002
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,400
It must have something to do with the Spirit Spring.

1003
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,130
But how did it manage to do this?

1004
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,950
It's you, the immortal masters.

1005
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,030
Thank you for saving my life, immortal masters!

1006
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,830
It's our duty.

1007
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,160
Let me ask you,

1008
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,130
have you eaten

1009
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,590
Madam Wu's steamed buns recently?

1010
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,250
Yes, I have.

1011
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,760
In the past few days,

1012
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,940
did you interact with any of

1013
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,000
those missing Elite Armored Guards?

1014
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,970
Five years ago,

1015
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,550
we all served

1016
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,150
in a small border patrol unit

1017
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,520
for half a month.

1018
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,880
In that unit,

1019
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,050
besides you,

1020
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,680
how many are still alive?

1021
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,840
There's one more...

1022
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:38,710
Captain Qin.
