Ag nurtured

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,400
If it's too dark to see,

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
I will follow you all the way.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,600
I will face the love and hate of the world.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,000
I only wish to travel around the world a few times,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
to experience both the north and the west,

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,000
to have a good life and return to the right path.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I will give you a hundred years of happiness,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
to be with you forever.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,600
We are destined to be together in the mirror.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,200
But I am still fearless and fearless.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
When the flowers wither and the moon sets,

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I will still stay with you,

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,400
slowly leaving you.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I am him, he is me.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,600
If the Three Thousand Realms don't rise, I will not die nor perish.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
What will you gain from this?

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Using your own flesh to make such a treacherous thing,

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
even if you enter the Three Thousand Realms, you will have to cultivate your cultivation and become a mortal.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
But with my talent, even if I have to re-cultivate,

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
it won't take long.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
If you don't follow my wish, I will destroy everything again.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Re-cultivate the Three Thousand Realms.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
The Heavens have gone mad.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Now we only have one way.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Xiao Yue?

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,600
He and I have fought for so many years. I know him.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
There must be a soul in Su Yu's heart.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
But he can't bear to see it die.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
Su Yu! Wake up!

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Su Yu went to the Three Thousand Realms with me. It's a good thing.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Su Yu, save your breath.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Su Yu! If you can't protect the world,

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
then give me Su Yu's position.

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Don't be useless! Wake up!

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Xiao Yue, leave the altar.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Don't let the purple sword go out. Let the Heavens take it!

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Ran Ran, Su Yu...

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Su Yu, we have fought for so many years.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,800
If you still have the dignity of a traitor, then leave the altar.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,000
If you can't protect the world, then admit it. Don't hide from the Three Thousand Realms.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Stop dreaming.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Just you two, how can you fool him?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Su Yu Shui, you are a loser.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
You love to talk big.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
The world is mine.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,400
You want to protect it? Then protect it yourself.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Protect the Demon Trace?

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
When I was brought here on purpose,

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought about it all.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why?

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Our plan is about to succeed. Why did you do this?

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't you want to live a life of self-sacrifice?

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
I do!

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
But... I can't figure out what it is.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
It's good to be self-sacrificed.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,200
But every time, I can't figure out what it is.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Maybe Fei Hua is right.

70
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
That world...

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
doesn't belong to me.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You really let me down.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Right?

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
I was surprised too.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,600
In life, there are always ups and downs.

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
But these ups and downs,

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
each of them is unique.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Someone hates me,

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
someone loves me,

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
someone hates me,

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
someone loves me,

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
someone loves me.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
These ups and downs,

84
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
they are all memories.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
But now, when I think back,

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,200
every single one of them is so unique.

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Dun Tian!

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I know you won't let me go!

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Right now, I won't let myself go.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
I won't let you go!

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
I won't let you go!

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Tell Fei Hua, thank you for her.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,800
In this life,

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
I'll live a good life.

95
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll live a good life too.

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Xiao Yue!

97
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
Xiao Yue!

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Xiao Yue!

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Xiao Yue!

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
It's okay.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Even if both of them die, it's okay.

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200
Even if you die, you can still make it.

103
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
The Three Thousand Towers are about to be built.

104
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Everything can be done!

105
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
Xiao Shuai, look!

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,240
Someone is willing to die to return.

107
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,640
Dun Tian has the power to take the Three Thousand Towers.

108
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
He has a flaw.

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760
This is the chance that Xiao Yu gave us.

110
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,880
I'll hold him back.

111
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
You can point at him.

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
This tower is already a big city.

113
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,840
The power of Dun Tian to take the Three Thousand Towers will only be stronger.

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,360
You...

115
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't worry.

116
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,160
I will try my best to stop him.

117
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,400
I will try my best to live to accompany you.

118
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Hurry and go!

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,360
Kai Qi Sea.

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Through the power of the Deity.

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,000
It seems that you also know that this is the last moment in your life.

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,640
You really are going to live.

123
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,720
The situation of a dead fight should be like this.

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Milk enquanto precious oil

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,600
aaa

126
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
F phys Gabe

127
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,880
Kill her.

128
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Dragon power is really quite good.

129
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
You managed to break through the hole

130
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,000
through me by force.

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
I told you once.

132
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,440
This is about mending the old rule.

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,760
Get him.

134
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I'll kill you all together!

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Mo Jun!

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
You've been with me for so many years.

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Today, we'll be dead.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
We'll protect you till death.

139
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Xiao Shun!

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You go and control the hall.

141
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll go with you.

142
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll go with you.

143
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll go with you.

144
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I'll go with you.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll go with you.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll go with you.

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I'll go with you.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll go with you.

149
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll go with you.

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll go with you.

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll go with you.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll go with you.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll go with you.

154
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll go with you.

155
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I'll go with you.

156
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I'll go with you.

157
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I'll go with you.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll go with you.

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll go with you.

160
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll go with you.

161
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I'll go with you.

162
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I'll go with you.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll go with you.

164
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll go with you.

165
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I'll go with you.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll go with you.

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
I'll go with you.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll go with you.

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
I'll go with you.

170
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
I'll go with you.

171
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'll go with you.

172
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I'll go with you.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll go with you.

174
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll go with you.

175
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll go with you.

176
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'll go with you.

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I'll go with you.

178
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll go with you.

179
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, my!

180
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Ouch!

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
What's wrong with you?

182
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Dwriter,

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
it's over!

184
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,980
will come back!

185
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,740
The fiends of the Three Thousand Realms!

186
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,540
I'm willing to sacrifice everything in this world

187
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,420
and myself!

188
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,180
Come on!

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,460
Use my flesh and blood

190
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,860
to open the Three Thousand Realms!

191
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,960
Come on!

192
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,140
You can never

193
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,020
hate the heavens.

194
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm here.

195
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Deity.

196
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Deity.

197
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,940
How could you take over the mortal world?

198
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,100
You blocked the path of the Dragon Island and the Immortal Realm.

199
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,580
Luckily, Xue Ran Ran and Su Yi Shui

200
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,540
destroyed the Three Thousand Swords Tower.

201
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,900
That's how we arrived.

202
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,260
That's all for your ambition today.

203
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,140
Three Thousand Swords...

204
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,660
My Three Thousand Swords...

205
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,420
My Three Thousand Swords...

206
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,860
My Three Thousand Swords...

207
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,460
My Three Thousand Swords...

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,140
The Three Thousand Swords is false!

209
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,820
The blood of Ruin...

210
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,860
is even worse.

211
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,020
You guys are the reason...

212
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,220
for the Ram Adam manufactory.

213
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,980
You guys are the reason for everything!

214
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
and come to me.

215
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,220
You're too selfish.

216
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,620
You abandoned them first,

217
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,220
but you also buried them with a single soul

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,020
for your own regret.

219
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,860
In this way,

220
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,700
even if you're reborn,

221
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,500
you'll still be the same.

222
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,260
You'll never know.

223
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,220
I want to make chicken legs. It smells so good.

224
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
My husband, it's time to eat.

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Ruo Yao.

226
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,300
Dad, if you don't come,

227
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,100
I'll eat all the chicken legs and chicken feet.

228
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
Ruo Er.

229
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,180
Dad, I really ate them.

230
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,420
I won't leave them to you.

231
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Ruo Er.

232
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,940
The peach blossom is in full bloom in March.

233
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,940
I'll sing it with my daughter.

234
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Ruo Yao.

235
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,940
I'll drink wine and soup for one day.

236
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm not feeling well.

237
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,940
My heart is fluttering.

238
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Dragon God

239
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Thanks to Dragon God's arrival,

240
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
otherwise, the consequences would be unpredictable.

241
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
If it weren't for you,

242
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
I and those guys from the Immortal Realm

243
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
would have no choice.

244
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Qing Luo is badly injured.

245
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
I don't know when she'll recover.

246
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,940
The dragon clan is long-lived.

247
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Even if she's badly injured,

248
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
she'll be fine after a hundred years.

249
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
But you guys,

250
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,940
you don't need to tell me about your injuries.

251
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,940
The whole earth has been destroyed.

252
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
What are you going to do?

253
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
The human clan is short-lived,

254
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
but they are still alive.

255
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
That's right.

256
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,940
If we work together,

257
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,940
we can make everything come back to normal.

258
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Good girl.

259
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
I'll stay here if I can't.

260
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
I'll take Qing Luo to take her first.

261
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
If you have time,

262
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
come to Dragon Island again.

263
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
I'll welcome you anytime.

264
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Let's go.

265
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Master.

266
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Master.

267
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Ran Ran.

268
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Ran Ran.

269
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
You're fine.

270
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
That's great.

271
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Xi Er.

272
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Master and Ran Ran are fine.

273
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
They should be happy.

274
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
Don't cry.

275
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Yes.

276
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
It's a great joy to guard

277
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
this world.

278
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay.

279
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
It's good that you're fine.

280
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's good that you're fine.

281
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
You have been living a life of misery.

282
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,940
You saved all the people in danger.

283
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
You are the representative of our Xuan clan.

284
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Yes.

285
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Please accept our respect.

286
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
We are the same.

287
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
You don't have to be polite.

288
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,940
We saved ourselves.

289
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Besides, you risked your lives to protect each other.

290
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
This land

291
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
is not worth being a ruins.

292
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
It's over.

293
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,940
There are more things to do.

294
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,940
We should help the people to repair their homes first.

295
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
That's more important.

296
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,940
You're right.

297
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
I've finished writing.

298
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
Forget it.

299
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Let's do something serious.

300
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
The weight of the chief of Wei clan

301
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
may have moved.

302
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
It's a shame that it can't move.

303
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
The golden bone has fallen.

304
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,940
It's a pity that it was thrown out of the space.

305
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I protected his heart vein.

306
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
It doesn't matter if he's injured.

307
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
It's so easy to say.

308
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
It hurts.

309
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
Forget it.

310
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
I won't argue with you.

311
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
They say that the Xuantian clan is a demon clan.

313
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
But the chief of Wei clan and Elder Tu

314
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
are in danger.

315
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
It's our Xuantian clan's fault.

316
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
From today on,

317
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
the cultivators will no longer be divided into the Xuantian clan and the demon clan.

318
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
As long as we do justice,

319
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
the world will be one family.

320
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Who is one family with you?

321
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
We are still the one-on-one demon clan.

322
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm still the devil.

323
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
You...

324
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
If you see me in the future,

325
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,940
come and greet me.

326
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
I'll beat you.

327
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Ranran, Yishui,

328
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
do you have any plans?

329
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Plan?

330
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Now the West Mountain is destroyed.

331
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
No one can live there.

332
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
If you don't mind,

333
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
you can come to our empty mountain.

334
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Although the spiritual vein is damaged,

335
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,940
it's still the immortal mountain.

336
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Jiuhua Wildlands welcomes you all.

337
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
The world's best is to choose the best.

338
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Ranran,

339
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
let's go to the mountain.

340
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
We can drink good wine together.

341
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Right?

342
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Right.

343
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,940
It's good to drink from morning to night.

344
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
Thank you, Meiyi.

345
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
But the West Mountain is very good.

346
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
What Xiaoshui means is

347
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
the West Mountain is still our home.

348
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
It won't take long

349
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
until the West Mountain is restored.

350
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
I'm not sure.

351
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Let's drink together.

352
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
Sure.

353
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
The West Mountain

354
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
I climbed the mountain

355
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
with two tides

356
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
from afar.

357
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
I don't know what to do.

358
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
I can't see anyone.

360
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Xiaoshui.

361
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Su Yishui.

362
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Today is the seventh day.

363
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
I asked you to come to the mountain

364
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
to see the lanterns.

365
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,940
People put lanterns on the river.

366
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
But you came to the mountain top.

367
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Why do I need to see the lanterns

368
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
like others?

369
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
The fairy tree

370
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
is very meaningful to me.

371
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
It's here that I can

372
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
make my wish come true.

373
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Okay.

374
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Wait for the lanterns to light up.

375
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Let's drink.

376
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
Why are you in a hurry?

377
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
We haven't done the formalities.

378
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
I've already lit the lanterns.

379
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
What formalities?

380
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
You need to write love letters

381
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
when you light the lanterns.

382
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Have you written it?

383
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Sure.

384
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Give me one.

385
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
I'll write it for you.

386
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
One?

387
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
I've bought dozens of them.

388
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
You need to write dozens of them?

389
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm not a painter.

390
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
I don't have that many love letters.

391
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,940
The days that we have in the future

392
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
are very long.

393
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Can't you write dozens of love letters?

394
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
If you can't write it well,

395
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
don't think about drinking.

396
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
I'll watch you write it.

397
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
You need to watch it.

398
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Why do I need to watch it?

399
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
So many young people

400
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
from the Xuanmen Sect

401
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
are fascinated by you.

402
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
They are like ghosts.

403
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,940
Of course you need to watch it.

404
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
You don't need to do that.

405
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
In the past three years,

406
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
countless female masters

407
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
have sent gifts to the West Mountain.

408
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,940
So, Su,

409
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
you can't write the love letters

410
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
just for me.

411
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
You should write it with me.

412
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
Besides...

413
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
The ink sword?

414
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Mr. Jiu and Liang Wumeng

415
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
have been looking for it for three years.

416
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
It took three years to fix it.

417
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
If you don't write it,

418
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
I won't return it to you.

419
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Fine.

420
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
But the love letters are fine.

421
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I have something

422
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
more important to do.

423
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
If the moon is full,

424
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
if the yearning is gone,

425
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,940
I'd like to follow you like the clouds.

426
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,940
I want to see the world without eyes,

427
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,940
to see the one I love forever.

428
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
Eat more.

429
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Master, Ranran.

430
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Oh, no.

431
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
The chief of Wei Sect just broke into the West Mountain

432
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
to find Tu Zhangwao in Lingxi Palace.

433
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,940
You keep him in Lingxi Palace to hide from Wei Jiu,

434
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
but you still have to face him.

435
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
He had nowhere to go three years ago.

436
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
You have to help him.

437
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Oh, no.

438
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
What?

439
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
The sword formation in Lingxi Palace

440
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
is against our new plan.

441
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Wei Jiu doesn't have the West Mountain token.

442
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
If he breaks in,

443
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
he will open the sword formation.

444
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
Master.

445
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Master.

446
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
Shengjie.

447
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Please introduce me to him.

448
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
I'm out.

449
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
What do you want to say?

450
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Say it now.

451
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Shengjie, I was wrong.

452
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
I was wrong a lot.

453
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
I came here just to tell you.

454
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
You are a good person.

455
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
A good person is not a bad person.

456
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,940
I really don't want to be a bad person.

457
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,940
I want to be a good person.

458
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
I want to be a good person.

459
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
I want to be a good person.

460
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
I want to be a good person.

461
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
I want to be a good person.

462
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,940
I came just to tell you

463
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,580
that I really regretted it.

464
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,500
I raised many butterflies.

465
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,540
In the valley in the west of Mount Zhiyan,

466
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,380
I raised many butterflies for you.

467
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,980
Now,

468
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,420
it's called Butterfly Valley.

469
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,380
You don't have to avoid the Xuan Tian Village for me.

470
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
I'm leaving.

471
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,940
If you go back to Mount Zhiyan,

472
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll go and have a look.

473
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,180
Once my wish is fulfilled,

474
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,140
let's

475
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,100
part ways.

476
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,500
You left the mountain gate and didn't care.

477
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,500
Where are you going?

478
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm going to think about my fault.

479
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,900
You can't leave.

480
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,140
The old sect leader entrusted everything to you,

481
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,020
but you're hiding from thinking about your fault.

482
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,860
Is this called being lazy?

483
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,660
If you really want to think about your fault,

484
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,140
then change your past and rebuild the Nuo Sect.

485
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,700
It's not that I don't want to.

486
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,940
It's just that in the past,

487
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,540
you and I used to work together.

488
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,540
But now,

489
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
I've lost the person I most relied on.

490
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
Why would I have the face to rebuild the Nuo Sect?

491
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,380
Forget it.

492
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,100
I'll help you for a year.

493
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,140
If in this year,

494
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,660
I won't let the old sect leader

495
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,460
take care of what you've done.

496
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll make another year

497
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,740
until I'm sure that

498
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
you've completely changed your mind.

499
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,580
Really?

500
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,620
Don't think that's forgiveness.

501
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I just don't want to let the old sect leader down.

502
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,860
Okay.

503
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,580
Okay.

504
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,980
I'll take you there.

505
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,300
No.

506
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
I'll take you back.

507
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,500
Bui Bai Shan,

508
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,980
I think

509
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,220
Junhao and you

510
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,140
will definitely have a happy try.

511
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,620
Aren't I something

512
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,380
that I 1-year-old

513
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,140
didn't want to do though?

514
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,580
Master, did I do something wrong again?

515
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,340
You're very young. What mistake did you make?

516
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Get up.

517
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,180
I don't want to be the west mountain chief anymore.

518
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,780
You're the big disciple of the west mountain. Of course, you should take over.

519
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:23,900
Master, I've made a big mistake.

520
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,660
Senior Brother, who wouldn't make a mistake?

521
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,460
You've been working hard to rebuild the west mountain for the past three years.

522
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,820
Everyone is very impressed.

523
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,420
It's only right that I give you the position of the chief.

524
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,220
Don't push the three ancestral temples anymore.

525
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,500
Do you want to cut off the inheritance of the west mountain?

526
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,220
Take my order.

527
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
I will definitely make the west mountain

528
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
more prosperous.

529
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,380
We don't need to make it more prosperous.

530
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Just follow the fate.

531
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
I will do my best.

532
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,020
This is the guest list and the wedding list of the wedding banquet.

533
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Wedding banquet?

534
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
The wedding list?

535
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
The wedding list?

536
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
The wedding list?

537
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
The wedding list?

538
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Wedding banquet? The wedding list?

539
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,020
Three years ago, we agreed that we would get married after the west mountain was rebuilt.

540
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Now, it's time.

541
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,420
My wedding with Ran Ran

542
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,220
is held in the west mountain.

543
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,620
No wonder so many boxes were delivered today.

544
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,420
The love is for the wedding.

545
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,420
It's a happy event. It's a great happiness.

546
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,420
The wedding is the first big event of my being the chief.

547
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,020
Master, Ran Ran,

548
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I will handle the wedding.

549
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,420
Senior, the wedding is too complicated.

550
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,220
I'm so confused.

551
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,220
I will leave the life of my master to you.

552
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Everyone, be quick.

553
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Work faster.

554
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,420
Be careful. Don't fall.

555
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
Don't worry, Senior.

556
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,620
What?

557
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,620
The chief of the west mountain still doesn't understand?

558
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,420
Senior, it's a big event.

559
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,820
Don't make fun of me.

560
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,220
How satisfied.

561
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,720
What a good day to have the wedding.

562
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,620
Why are you entering the house with the heaven and earth stillế

563
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,020
and aren't standing yet?

564
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,540
will take care of your marriage last.

565
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,360
Go.

566
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:19,800
Where's the

567
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
fairy fundamentalistР

568
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,440
What let Animation

569
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,500
letここ

570
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,740
tell you

571
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,120
where's tombstone

572
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,900
How should I prepare for it?

573
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,940
They say you were a demoness in your previous life.

574
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,740
Now it seems

575
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,620
you have a reputation.

576
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,780
I have a reputation.

577
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,780
Are you experienced?

578
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,700
No.

579
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
But for the past twenty years,

580
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,860
I've been dreaming of a girl.

581
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,420
She's seducing me

582
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,060
while changing my water.

583
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,260
Maybe I've been dreaming too much

584
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,460
and I've lost my way in many things.

585
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,780
I've never heard anyone

586
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,180
learn this in their dreams.

587
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,900
The one who's in your dream is a fox demoness.

588
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,540
Then check it out tonight.

589
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,540
How many fox tails does she have?

590
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,580
You...

591
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,420
You should get out of here.

592
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,900
Don't disturb my makeup.

593
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,740
Put this off!

594
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,660
The difference of power

595
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,780
is more obvious now.

596
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,380
The mind and deinequ are equal.

597
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Everyone, what are you waiting for?

598
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Hurry and come outside to get your money!

599
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Tui Tui!

600
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,620
Come, come, your money is here!

601
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Don't worry, we all have it!

602
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Actually, I didn't come to steal these things.

603
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
I just wanted to give my child some money.

604
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
I'm still very happy.

605
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Yuan'er, I'll give you all of them.

606
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Put the horse down!

607
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Newly-weds cross the river!

608
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
The flowers bloom and the land is in peace!

609
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
First bow to heaven and earth!

610
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Second bow to the high pagoda!

611
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Husband and wife bow to each other!

612
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Bow!

613
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
The moon that came again,

614
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,620
has been re-appear again.

615
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
I wish you two new people a happy marriage,

616
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
love and friendship!

617
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
Love and friendship will last forever!

618
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
Then let's wish for a hundred years of good marriage.

619
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
May you have a long life!

620
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
May everything go well with you!

621
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Su Yishui...

622
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Su Yishui,

623
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
please help me with my chores!

624
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
What do you mean by that?

625
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
I wish you two

626
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
a long life,

627
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,620
a long life,

628
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
and a long life.

629
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Okay!

630
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Then I wish

631
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
that there will be good wine every day,

632
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
and that everything will be fine!

633
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
I wish you a long life,

634
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
a long life,

635
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
and a long life.

636
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Come, come, come!

637
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
Come, let's all drink a toast to the bride and groom!

638
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Come!

639
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Let's drink this toast together!

640
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Everyone, please!

641
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,620
Okay, let's drink together!

642
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
Let's go!

643
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Here, drink this.

644
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
What's wrong?

645
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
You're drunk?

646
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
I'll drink them all up

647
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
and then we'll go to the bridal chamber.

648
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Your alcohol tolerance...

649
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
I'll use three sugar five-day-old

650
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
to exchange with the old wine.

651
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
I'll drink till I'm drunk.

652
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Master, Ren Ran!

653
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
Cheers!

654
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Cheers!

655
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,620
What kind of wine did you drink?

656
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
This taste...

657
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
It's a wine that's good for the heart.

658
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
You...

659
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
My dear, it's getting late.

660
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
We should rest early too.

661
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,160
We didn't get to come today,

662
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,000
We dream of summer

663
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Due to our combative pick,

664
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Master

665
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,840
It's been three days

666
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Why aren't Ranran and master here?

667
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Ranran

668
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Master

669
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Master

670
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Ranran

671
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,280
We are contented

672
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
We have nothing to ask for

673
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,800
We will travel the world together

674
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,880
We will meet in the future

675
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,680
If we are destined, we will meet again

676
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Master

677
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,600
What should we do?

678
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
What?

679
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,200
You are the chief of West Mountain

680
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,560
You will take care of the daily life of the sect

681
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We are still Zhang Yanzhuang

682
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,960
When will they come back?

683
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,400
Maybe when they are tired

684
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,520
Maybe when they miss home

685
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,520
Maybe when they are born

686
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Who knows?

687
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You two

688
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,600
The new disciples of West Mountain are very good

689
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,800
Will you teach me?

690
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,040
I don't know how to write

691
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,920
Look at my beard

692
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,040
Is it growing?

693
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,640
You have to teach me

694
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,120
You have to teach me

695
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,040
The two chiefs of West Mountain

696
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,120
Go to the market

697
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,600
Let me do this

698
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Moreover

699
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
Your new chief

700
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,240
Hasn't he adjusted the rules of West Mountain?

701
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,960
We just drink tea and plant flowers

702
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,680
Come, drink tea

703
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Tea

704
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,440
This tree was planted by the chief of West Mountain

705
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,920
For the fourth chief

706
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,080
The war 16 years ago

707
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
Although it became a tomb

708
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,960
We didn't raise it with our spiritual power

709
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,360
And now it's not only alive

710
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,960
It's even more prosperous

711
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
This is the road of the west mountain chief

712
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,360
It tells the story of Mu Qingge and Su Yishui

713
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
The chief of West Mountain

714
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,640
I heard that they are traveling around the world

715
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
To kill demons

716
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,440
They are really fairies

717
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,200
I don't know if they are fairies

718
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,520
Fairies?

719
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,080
That's boring

720
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,240
In our West Mountain training

721
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
We never ask for fairies

722
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,240
Just have fun and have fun in the world

723
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,960
It's better than being fairies

724
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,440
costume

725
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,440
Ready

726
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
Go

727
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,400
Sweet potato

728
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,480
Bro, give me

729
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,760
Hurry

730
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,000
We need to eat

731
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,720
You spilled the porridge.

732
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,600
You clean and cook for me.

733
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,840
Why do you always come to me for porridge?

734
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,040
Who told you to make money and be an apprentice?

735
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,640
Of course I'll pay you back.

736
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,680
When I was an apprentice,

737
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,880
I was the one who played the zither and looked at me making the chicken nest.

738
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,160
I made a dirty hand.

739
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,400
Okay.

740
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,320
You look good tonight.

741
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,480
You're not good at making money.

742
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,920
I'll make another one.

743
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm afraid I won't be able to make it.

744
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
Dad, are the pancakes ready?

745
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,840
I really want to eat them.

746
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,800
Okay.

747
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,840
Dad is coming.

748
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,720
He'll be out of the pot soon.

749
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,680
Let's go have fun.

750
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,560
Okay.

751
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
Don't stay under the sun for too long.

752
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,680
The meal is almost ready.

753
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,120
As expected,

754
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,400
a place with trees is home.
