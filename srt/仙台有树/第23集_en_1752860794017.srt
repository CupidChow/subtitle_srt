& D 발

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times,

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
travel to the north and west,

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if I have to go back and forth a thousand times,

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am destined to be alone.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I am still fearless and never regret.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't wait for the falling flowers to bloom and the people to become one.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I hate you for slowly leaving me.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Love and Hate

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh no. The situation is even earlier than I thought.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
His ice chain has completely broken.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ice chain?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He used half of the gold elixir to transfer the holy tree to the yin and yang.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So he had to cultivate the ice chain to replenish the gold elixir.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now that the ice chain is broken, half of the gold elixir is broken too.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So he fell into the magic machine.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
His spiritual power is at this time.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If he can't find a way to stabilize his spiritual power,

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
he will be in trouble and die.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will find a way to save him.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But I hope it's a little bit more subtle.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shifu, I will help you control your spiritual power.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Isn't he very privileged?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I brought him food today.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You wished to put your hard work into helping others.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How much eyes can't do what you like?

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Open your eyes.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,720
Master.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,280
Don't move.

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,120
It's dangerous. Don't run.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,320
Master.

35
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,720
I can save you.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
I will definitely save you.

37
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,880
Xiaotang, help me.

38
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,160
I want to be like Master.

39
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,340
You can die as long as we can get out.

40
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,460
Kelly.

41
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,540
Master.

42
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,300
Master.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
How can I save you?

44
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Teacher's illness is so severe,

45
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
he fell into the flower bed.

46
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,200
That's why he can't control his spiritual power,

47
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
and that's why he has such an endless pain.

48
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,400
He is the reincarnation fruit that Teacher raised.

49
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
It's the same as Teacher.

50
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,200
My primordial power can help Teacher.

51
00:05:44,200 --> 00:06:06,440

Master!

57
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Are you alright?

58
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Master!

59
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
What happened?

60
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Master!

61
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Master, please forgive me!

62
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
This is a good deed you've done!

63
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Master, please forgive me!

64
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
What is this?

65
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
This is the Three Flower Pavilion!

66
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Master, please forgive me!

67
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Master!

68
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Master!

Master!

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Master!

72
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Master!

73
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Master!

74
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Master!

75
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Master!

76
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
This is the order of the Third Prince's death!

77
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Master, we've never had any grudges against the Third Prince!

78
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Why would he kill you?

79
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
What else could it be?

80
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm with the Crown Prince.

81
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
His hand is already here.

82
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Let's talk when we get back.

83
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes.

84
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Why?

85
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Why can't you cure my wound?

86
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm afraid it's because I'm too worried.

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm afraid it's because I'm too worried.

88
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
You're too worried.

89
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Master, please don't panic.

90
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Give me some more time.

91
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Time?

92
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm getting married soon.

93
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
How can I wait for time?

94
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I finally got this.

95
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You should find a way to cure me as soon as possible.

96
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Xiao Yu, why aren't you here yet?

97
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Didn't I tell you to go and ask for help?

98
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Why aren't you sending someone to rush us?

99
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Your Highness, we're here to see you.

100
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Please.

101
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yes.

102
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Your Highness.

103
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Where's Xiao Yu?

104
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Your Highness has something important to do.

105
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm afraid you can't come to visit tonight.

106
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Please rest in peace.

107
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't you know that I'm injured?

108
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
And I was plotted against on the road.

109
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
That was done by the Third Prince.

110
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
He wasn't just targeting me.

111
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I have to tell Xiao Yu about one of the details

112
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
so that he can be careful.

113
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Your Highness, the Third Prince and you are close.

114
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Your Highness mustn't forget about it.

115
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
He will investigate this matter.

116
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Once the truth is found,

117
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
we will seek justice for Your Highness.

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Also, Your Highness said that Your Highness's face is damaged.

119
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
The wedding will be postponed.

120
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
We'll discuss it another day.

121
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
What do you mean by another day?

122
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
If I don't recover from this injury,

123
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
then I won't get married for a day.

124
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
No.

125
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I have to go and explain to Your Highness.

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Your Highness, the Crown Prince has been

127
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
taking the medicine for Your Majesty for days.

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Your Highness, you haven't continued to practice.

129
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
The Crown Prince has already given up on him.

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Please forgive him.

131
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Your Highness,

132
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I heard that Your Highness was injured.

133
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I brought you a bottle of secret medicine.

134
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It's said that Your Highness made it with the secret recipe

135
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
to treat the injury of the magic lock.

136
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I hope that it can help Your Highness recover.

137
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Let her get out!

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

139
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
All of you, get out!

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Teacher.

141
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
You still want me to lose favor in front of the Crown Prince.

142
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
How can you give me such a good medicine?

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
This bitch.

144
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
She wants to take advantage of the opportunity to get promoted.

145
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I think she's too heartless.

146
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,260
Just a bottle of

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
the medicine can cure me.

148
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I will definitely practice it again.

149
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
A bottle of the medicine.

150
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Wang Sui Zhi.

151
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Did you find the spirit grass I asked you to find?

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Teacher.

153
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
That kind of grass medicine that improves spiritual power in a short time.

154
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
In the past, you didn't let us take it.

155
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
It's very harmful.

156
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's also easy to get back to the body.

157
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
It's not a long-term solution.

158
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Give it to me.

159
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Teacher.

160
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Please listen to me.

161
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Please leave the palace.

162
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't force yourself to break through this life for Su Yu.

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
It's not worth it.

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Is it worth it?

165
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
How can you tell me?

166
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
This time, I found the spirit grass I asked you to find.

167
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I just found that

168
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Wu Mi was also looking for this grass.

169
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
This grass has not only improved spiritual power,

170
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
but also has the effect of detoxifying poison.

171
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I was curious.

172
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I followed this guard

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
and entered the Crown Prince's Palace.

174
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I saw...

175
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
It turns out that he was poisoned.

176
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
He died not long ago.

177
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I followed this guard.

178
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Do you know who poisoned him?

179
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,200
It was the second prince who was saved by Su Yu's men many years ago.

180
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Isn't that second prince dead?

181
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
That's right.

182
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
So Su Yu was poisoned.

183
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Ten years ago,

184
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
the elixir of the bottle was not what the emperor wanted.

185
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
It was the Crown Prince who did it for himself.

186
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Master, you can't master the high-quality elixir of the bottle.

187
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
How can it be useful to him?

188
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Under the imperial power, there is no true love.

189
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
He has long been a trickster.

190
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
He is a man of great power.

191
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
He is not the one you miss.

192
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Impossible.

193
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
He loves me.

194
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
He loves me.

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
He has waited for me for 18 years.

196
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
He can't be poor.

197
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Master, if he really loves you,

198
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
he won't promote you to the Xi Sui pond.

199
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
He just deliberately exposed the secret to the third prince.

200
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,200
He just wants you to be a target to help him block the Ming Qiang case.

201
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Enough.

202
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
If that's the case,

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I won't leave.

204
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
As long as I'm strong enough,

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Su Yu can't leave me.

206
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I will get his heart sooner or later.

207
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I haven't thought about

208
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
being rich and rich in this life.

209
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm not a rich man.

210
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I'm just a poor man.

211
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I've been training my mother in the last life.

212
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm still training my mother in the present life.

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I will restore my spiritual power

214
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
and help her free herself.

215
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Master.

216
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Stop talking.

217
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
You should get everything back I want.

218
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
I was born to be a martial artist.

219
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm helping you every day.

220
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I will never leave Su Yu.

221
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I will never give the crown prince's title

222
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
to anyone.

223
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Master.

224
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
You're awake.

225
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Are you still feeling unwell?

226
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Are you going to get up?

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Let me help you.

228
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
No need.

229
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Let me help you.

230
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Get out.

231
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm going to get you up.

232
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
I'm going to get you up.

233
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Get up.

234
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Get up.

235
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Get up.

236
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Get up.

237
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Get up.

238
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Get up.

239
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Get up.

240
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Get up.

241
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Get up.

242
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Get up.

243
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Get up.

244
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Master's injury hasn't healed yet.

245
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I have to protect you.

246
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm no longer your master.

247
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

248
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Why are you still staying in the Western Mountains?

249
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I will never leave you.

250
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I will never leave the Western Mountains.

251
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
When you're better,

252
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I will go to find Liang Wu Meng.

253
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
I will definitely find a way to return the spiritual power to you.

254
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Didn't you already know my identity

255
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
in Liu Yin Dong?

256
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
You still dare to stay here.

257
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

258
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm not afraid.

259
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I know whatever your identity is.

260
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
You will never harm me.

261
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I know that.

262
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Your ice lotus bow is cold and cold only to yourself.

263
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Your heartless path is also only heartless to yourself.

264
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
You did so much for me,

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
but you didn't tell me anything.

266
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I thought about it for a long time.

267
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Master,

268
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
can I just guess

269
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
that you have me in your heart?

270
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Your disciple knows that you are a demon

271
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
and doesn't dislike you.

272
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Let me go.

273
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Let me enter your heart and help you keep it.

274
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
What are you waiting for?

275
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Don't you want it?

276
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Are you still willing to let go of this life?

277
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Let me help you.

278
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Shut up!

279
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Master, what's wrong with you?

280
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Does your brain ache?

281
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Who taught you to talk to yourself?

282
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm afraid that you will come out of the Tienmai Mountain

284
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
and get trapped in the West Mountain.

285
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I was fed up with it all my life,

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
so I helped you.

287
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
But I was the one who made a mistake.

288
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I failed in my skills

289
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
and I couldn't get out of the White Tiger's body.

290
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
I didn't know that you were so useless

291
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
and dragged me to this point.

292
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
If I knew that you would have such a bad memory,

293
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I shouldn't have helped you.

294
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
As expected,

295
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
you're so useless.

296
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Master, you're going to say these

297
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
heartless words to hurt people again.

298
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Do you think I will believe it?

299
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
How can anyone hate others

300
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
and give up a soul to protect him?

301
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Master, you have to pretend to be cold and ruthless,

302
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
and you have to act like a hero.

303
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
If I was too weak in the past,

304
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
but now I've become a golden elixir,

305
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
what can we face together?

306
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Do you know why I'm so cruel to you?

307
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Why?

308
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Of course it's because of Mu Qingge.

309
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Didn't you know

310
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
that I love her deeply?

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
But she didn't know my feelings for her.

312
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
She was a bad person in the past,

313
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
trying to save everyone.

314
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Even a traitor like me

315
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
didn't care about helping others.

316
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
But she told me

317
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
that she wanted to meet me

318
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
in the end of her life.

319
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
What could I do?

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I could only prove to her

321
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
that I could be a good person.

322
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
That's why I took care of you.

323
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
She was also

324
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
so kind to me.

325
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
I could only do what she wanted me to do

326
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
so that she could get back

327
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
what she wanted.

328
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Master, I don't believe

329
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,200
that you don't love me at all.

330
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
No.

331
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
If I had made you feel

332
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
the same way I did to you,

333
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I would have told you clearly today

334
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
that I had no feelings

335
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
for Mu Qingge.

336
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
It's all Mu Qingge's fault.

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
She didn't love you at all.

338
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
But you knew it.

339
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
That Mu Xian Shi

340
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
is not Mu Qingge at all.

341
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I know it very well.

342
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
This is between her and me.

343
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
It's not your turn to interfere.

344
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I took you as my disciple

345
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
and I did what I should do.

346
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
You should have your own rules.

347
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
If you have such an ungrateful thought,

348
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
get out of my life.

349
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Master's coldness

350
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
makes me confused.

351
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
But everything you did

352
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
is only your duty.

353
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I don't believe it.

354
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I don't believe it.

355
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I don't believe it.

356
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Get out.

357
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Don't delay my recovery.

358
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Can you stop your disciple

359
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
from being nice to you

360
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
by saying these cruel words to her?

361
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
You are not a good person.

362
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
What's wrong with

363
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
following your own desires and ambitions?

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
What do you want to do?

365
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
You are so miserable.

366
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
You sealed me

367
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
by sealing your true feelings.

368
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Anyway, you have fallen into the mortal realm.

369
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Su Yishui,

370
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
you will die if you seal me.

371
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Aren't you afraid of death?

372
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I am afraid I can't seal the spiritual spring for long.

373
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't have much time.

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I need to recover quickly

375
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
and get the Black Sky Pellet.

376
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Master,

377
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
you are so kind.

378
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
I am afraid you can't

379
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
get the spiritual spring for long.

380
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
I don't have much time.

381
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I need to recover quickly

382
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
and get the Black Sky Pellet.

383
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Master,

384
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
you are so kind.

385
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Okay.

386
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Ranran.

387
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Master Y noticed.

388
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Why are you crying?

389
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Did he scold you?

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I know it all.

391
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Ling Xiao is my master's soul.

392
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
You already knew about it, right?

393
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Ah, this...

394
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I can feel that Master has been hiding a lot from me.

395
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm sure that you won't tell me even if you ask Master.

396
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
But I will never leave Mount Xi at this time.

397
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I will immediately send a letter to Liang Wu Meng

398
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
and ask him to send back the method of soul-repeating.

399
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
It's been 19 years.

400
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
How can there be such a method?

401
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Even if there is,

402
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
there is.

403
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
You can't bear the price.

404
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Since your master gave you back then,

405
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
you never thought of taking it back.

406
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
But that's Master's kindness.

407
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't just accept his kindness.

408
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
He always arranged for me to take care of me.

409
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
But I've grown up now.

410
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I want to take care of him too.

411
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I want to stand by his side and protect him from the wind and rain.

412
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
That's what he owes you.

413
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
He should do that.

414
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Anyway,

415
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,200
it's natural for a master to take care of his disciple.

416
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Don't think too much about it.

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
But does he really only care about Master's kindness to me?

418
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
But what if I still have more dreams?

419
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
That is to say,

420
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
I've started to yearn for him.

421
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Master,

422
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I've started to yearn for him.

423
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Master,

424
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
what kind of person is Mu Qingge?

425
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Why does Master care so much about him?

426
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
He is a very good person.

427
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
You are the same.

428
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
You deserve better.

429
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
But I don't want anything better.

430
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
If Master can't bear the pain of the past,

431
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
he will come back.

432
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
One day,

433
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
you will see me.

434
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Congratulations, Master.

435
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Master,

436
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
you not only regained your spiritual power from the Black Division,

437
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
but also reached the peak of the Cloud.

438
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
If it weren't for Mu Qingge's scheme,

439
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I would have become stronger.

440
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
It's a pity that

441
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
without spiritual power,

442
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I still can't open the Chiyan Mountain.

443
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Where is Tu Jiuyuan?

444
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Why doesn't he come to welcome me?

445
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Master,

446
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
since Master Tu was hurt by Su Yishui

447
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
in the last time,

448
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
he hasn't recovered.

449
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
He has been recovering from old injuries.

450
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Master.

451
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Master.

452
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Did you do it on purpose?

453
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
When did you become so ungrateful?

454
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
What is this?

456
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Black Water.

457
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
The whole mountain is covered with water.

458
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
The Mermaid Clan took it out.

459
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
It's cheap.

460
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
If you can't deal with Su Yishui with your spiritual power,

461
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
next time,

462
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
don't be beaten to death.

463
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Thank you, Master.

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
You came out of the Black Pool

465
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
and reached the peak.

466
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Why did you take the water from the Water Pool?

467
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
It seems that

468
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
you brought the water back for the Elder.

469
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I don't know if I should say this,

470
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
but why does Elder always have a hard time?

471
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
You mean...

472
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
If Elder wants to achieve his dream,

473
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
he should be soft-hearted.

474
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
He is like a hard steel,

475
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
better than a real steel.

476
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Master.

477
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Master.

478
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Guards.

479
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Who is not open-minded?

480
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
You took the account book as wine

481
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
and brought it to me.

482
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Why did I see someone else?

483
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
He looks like the Elder.

484
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
You didn't see it wrong.

485
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
It's me.

486
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Why are you dressed like this?

487
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I used the Black Pool water from the Elder

488
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
to heal my internal injury.

489
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
I came to thank you on purpose.

490
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
All right.

491
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
How do I see you?

492
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Your mouth is much redder than usual.

493
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Your face is much white,

494
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
as if you have a fever.

495
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
You are not a good person.

496
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Your face is much white,

497
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
as if you have been poisoned.

498
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Master,

499
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
the Elder stole the rouge powder.

500
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I made some snacks myself.

501
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
They are all your favorite.

502
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
All right.

503
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Don't delay your work when you recover.

504
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
You are not a person

505
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
who teaches etiquette.

506
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
You can just kill a few more people for me.

507
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Making some snacks

508
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
is not like you.

509
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
I made it for you before.

510
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
When you were young,

511
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
you liked to eat the回香糕.

512
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
When you were tired,

513
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I asked Senior Sister to take you to eat it.

514
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Later, the shop moved away.

515
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I learned it.

516
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Really?

517
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Why don't I remember?

518
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I still like this.

519
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Time flies.

520
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
People change

521
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
over time.

522
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
You are right.

523
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
That Mu Qingge

524
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
used to be

525
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
so handsome and cool.

526
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
She was different from everyone else.

527
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Now,

528
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
she is different.

529
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Now,

530
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
she is so cool.

531
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
She is so boring

532
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
and so vicious.

533
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
It's so annoying.

534
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
It's good

535
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
that you can see her clearly.

536
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Su Yishui,

537
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
that disciple,

538
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
is very suitable for my taste.

539
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
She is a bit like

540
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
the old Mu Qingge.

541
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Hey,

542
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
prepare some gifts

543
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
for Ranran.

544
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
She is a little hard-working.

545
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
She doesn't have much to sell.

546
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
She should be easy to sell.

547
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
This回香糕 is good.

548
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Bring it to her.

549
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
She is a disciple of the righteous sect.

550
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm afraid she won't be able to eat

551
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
your shabby snacks.

552
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
What righteous sect?

553
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Just kill her for me.

554
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Su Yishui will go back

555
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
from the water bath.

556
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Even if she is killed,

557
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I'm afraid she won't be able to

558
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
suppress Lingquan for long.

559
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
She will try her best

560
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
to find the door to the evil world.

561
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
At that time,

562
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
I'll give her a hand

563
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
to kill her,

564
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
the west mountain sect leader.

565
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
At that time,

566
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Lingquan and her

567
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
beautiful disciple,

568
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I can take them all in my pocket.

569
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Where are you going?

570
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Aren't you going to drink with me?

571
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
The great ambition of the Honorable Superior,

572
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
you'd better taste it alone.

573
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
This...

574
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
What's wrong with her?

575
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Isn't this a good way

576
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
to kill Su Yishui?

577
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
When the moon is in front of the window,

578
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I often think of you,

579
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
who gave me sweet potato chips.

580
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I'm grateful

581
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
and I deliberately gave you a good gift.

582
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm afraid you have a bloody skin,

583
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
and your eyes are swollen.

584
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I'll give you a good medicine.

585
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
I hope to see you again next time

586
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
when you're as cold as ice.

587
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I hope you can be with me

588
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
when I'm writing poems.

589
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Wei Jiu.

590
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Junior sister,

591
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
what the Honorable Superior wrote is love poems.

592
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
What is he going to do?

593
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
You're silly.

594
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Isn't it obvious

595
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
that you like our junior sister?

596
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
The pills sent here are all good pills.

597
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
It seems that the Honorable Superior

598
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
has really put blood in it.

599
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Junior sister,

600
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
look,

601
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
how to deal with these things?

602
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Burn it with fire.

603
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
I'll burn it with fire.

604
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I'll burn it with fire.

605
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I'll burn it with fire.

606
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Burn these things.

607
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Burn it with fire.

608
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Shanran,

609
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
there's a kind of

610
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
fire-resistant material on your body.

611
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
What's wrong?

612
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Master told me

613
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
not to tell others about his injury

614
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
in case it would confuse everyone's heart.

615
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Master, in order to protect us,

616
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
he's been blocking the sword formation.

617
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Don't worry.

618
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
If there's a letter from the Honorable Superior,

619
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
you must notify me immediately.

620
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
There's a letter

621
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
for Master.

622
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
It should be Su Yu's.

623
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll go get it for Master.

624
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Burn it.

625
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Burn it.

626
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Master.

627
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Master.

628
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Master.

629
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
The damage of the Soul-gathering Tree is so huge.

630
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Will Master have any sequelae?

631
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
The person who uses the Soul-gathering Tree

632
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
has stored the soul fragments

633
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
in the spirit beast's body.

634
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
So, within a month,

635
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
the spirit beast will be on the body.

636
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Sometimes,

637
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
it will maintain some of the spirit beast's habits.

638
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
You'll see the other spirits.

639
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
So, it's the post-traumatic stress.

640
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Master.

641
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Are you going to let me

642
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
play with you like Xiao Bai?

643
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Do you like it, Master?

644
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
You're still so good, Master.

645
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
You're not out of human rights at all.

646
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Master, are you hungry?

647
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I made some delicious food for you.

648
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I thought you'd take me out

649
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
with a bowl and a person.

650
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Here.

651
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Here.

652
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
When did you come in?

653
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Master,

654
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
when I came in,

655
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I saw Xiao Bai

656
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
on your body.

657
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
You asked me to touch you.

658
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
So, I...

659
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Didn't I tell you

660
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
to stay away from me?

661
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You can't hear me.

662
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Then, just take me

663
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
as a traitor.

664
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Master Zeng said

665
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
that you'll have

666
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
the post-traumatic stress

667
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
of the Soul-gathering Tree

668
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
in the next few days.

669
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Sometimes, you'll be like a little tiger.

670
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
You'll be a traitor

671
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
even if you're a beast.

672
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I'm not a beast.

673
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I'm a human.

674
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm a human.

675
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I have to guard you

676
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
and help you

677
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
to get some sleep.

678
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
You...

679
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Master, are you hungry?

680
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Do you want to eat

681
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
the food I made?

682
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Xue Ran Ran,

683
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
don't think that I'm not

684
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
trying to punish you.

685
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Master,

686
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
for what reason?

687
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Do you like me?

688
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I've turned over

689
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
the Western Mountain Rules several times.

690
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
None of them says

691
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
that you can't

692
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
be affectionate to your master.

693
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Besides,

694
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
isn't our Western Mountain

695
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
a holy place for traitors?

696
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I think that you

697
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
were just like me.

698
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Since you have someone else in your heart,

699
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
I'm late.

700
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I admit it.

701
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
But I can't

702
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
take you out of my heart.

703
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Master is kind to you

704
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
because of the Immortal of Wood.

705
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
He loves you deeply.

706
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
That's your cause and effect.

707
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
I spend days and nights with Master.

708
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
I love him

709
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
and I'm devoted to him.

710
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
That's the cause and effect

711
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
between me and him.

712
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Since the first day

713
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
you took me to the mountain,

714
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
you've been telling me

715
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
that there are ways to the West Mountain

716
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
and I should follow my own way.

717
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I've listened to you.

718
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
You have your persistence.

719
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I have mine.

720
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
You protect yours.

721
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I protect mine.

722
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
We have a long way to go.

723
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
I won't give up.

724
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
You're in charge of the Heaven,

725
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
the Earth and the Earth.

726
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
You can't control my heart.

727
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Master, what's wrong with your eyes?

728
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I don't have time

729
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
to listen to your nonsense.

730
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
It's so ridiculous.

731
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
From now on,

732
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I'll cook delicious food every day

733
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
to heal your wounds.

734
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Now I'm the best

735
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
single-servant on the mountain.

736
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
The food I cook

737
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
is delicious and can replenish your body.

738
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Master, don't eat it.

739
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
When your wounds are healed,

740
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
you can eat it.

741
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Don't eat it.

742
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Only when your wounds are healed

743
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
can you fight with your disciple

744
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
for a long time, right?

745
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Look what your disciple

746
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
cooked for you.

747
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Red bean porridge.

748
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Red bean to relieve the pain.

749
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
After waiting for more than ten years,

750
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
the response is right in front of you.

751
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Can you bear to die?

752
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
Are you so cruel to yourself?

753
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Master, I don't believe it.

754
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Everything you did to me

755
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
is not a little bit of love.

756
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You have your persistence.

757
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
I also have my persistence.

758
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
You protect yours.

759
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I protect mine.

760
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
We have a long way to go.

761
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I won't give up.

762
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Let me stay with you.

763
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
This time, the ending will be different.

764
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Trust me.

765
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I'll give you strength.

766
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
You can definitely control me.

767
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
No one in the world can bear it for you.

768
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
No one dares to hurt Xue Ran Ran again.

769
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I'll let you stay.

770
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I'll be the one who will hurt her in the future.

771
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I will never let the past repeat itself.

772
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Su Yu has seen Ran Ran's real identity.

773
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Master,

774
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
what does the letter mean?

775
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
There is no name in the letter.

776
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
But actually, in Puxin Village,

777
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Su Yu already knew

778
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Muran Wu's real identity.

779
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
But she didn't receive it.

780
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
She was so worried.

781
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
She was so worried.

782
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
She was so worried.

783
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
She was so worried.

784
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
She was so worried.

785
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
She was so worried.

786
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
But she didn't receive it.

787
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Instead, she was sent to the Western Water Pool.

788
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
She should have something to do.

789
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I guess she planned this.

790
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
It should be related to the Dragon Mother in Puxin Village.

791
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Master, you mean,

792
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Su Yu will be in the Dream Land?

793
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Isn't it an accident that

794
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
she appeared in Puxin Village?

795
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
My cousin,

796
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Ling Long is more concerned about me than me.

797
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I've been busy these days.

798
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
I should go to the palace

799
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
to get Nian Ce's Xuan Tian.

800
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I'll go to the palace

801
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
and see what medicine she sells.

802
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
What about Ruan Ruan?

803
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
She will have her own life.

804
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Zhan Xin's life

805
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
will be different from mine.

806
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
She will have her own life.

807
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Zhan Xin's life

808
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
will be different from mine.

809
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Ruan Ruan.

810
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm responsible for your transfer.

811
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
That's why I asked you to go back to the Western Mountain.

812
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Now the grudge is over.

813
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I have more important things to do.

814
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
I'll go to the Western Water Pool

815
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
and ask for your help.

816
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I'll go to the Western Water Pool

817
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
and ask for your help.

818
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I'll go to the Western Water Pool

819
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
and ask for your help.

820
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I'll go to the Western Water Pool

821
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
and ask for your help.

822
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I won't go back to this place.

823
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
You can go there yourself.

824
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
If you still think I'm your master,

825
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
promise me

826
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
not to be dragged by anything

827
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
and to be as free as the wind.

828
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,200
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,200
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,200
I can't sleep without hearing the sound of the flute.

869
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
I can't pass the test of fate.

870
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,200
I look forward to turning into a sky full of clouds.

871
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,200
I once held the sword in my hand.

872
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,200
I was the one who held the sword in my hand.

873
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
I met you.

874
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,200
A lifetime of ten thousand years.
