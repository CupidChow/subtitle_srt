[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,930
[Episode 16]

3
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,430
I didn't realize there was a finite number

4
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,890
of good days in one's life.

5
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,520
In the blink of an eye,

6
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,790
all has passed and only a few memories

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,120
are left for me to savor.

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm sorry I have failed you.

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,940
If there's a next life,

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,530
I'll give you a proper apology.

11
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,640
Do you know where she's buried?

12
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,000
[Tomb of My Dear Friend Mrs. Jiang]

13
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,040
It's said that burning a child's swaddling cloth

14
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,710
at his or her mother's grave

15
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,440
is a way to thank the mother for raising the child.

16
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,600
Your mother will rest in peace.

17
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,829
They never asked me.

18
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,990
They just made decisions for me.

19
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,110
They lived and ended their lives because of me.

20
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,710
Maybe

21
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,310
I just don't have the right to decide anything.

22
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,970
After all, I'm the reason for all that has happened.

23
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,350
The Heavenly Bottle didn't bother me anymore,

24
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000
but you still risked your life to get it.

25
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,960
Mrs. Jiang

26
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,770
just wanted you

27
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,860
to live a good life.

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,180
As for why she made decisions for you,

29
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,170
I don't think the reason is complicated.

30
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,570
When you love someone with all your heart,

31
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
you can think of nothing

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
but a simple idea.

33
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,870
That is, to give what you consider the best

34
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,960
to this person.

35
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,800
But the gods of fate love playing tricks on people.

36
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,100
If someone takes

37
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,160
just one more step forward,

38
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,220
everything will be different.

39
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,830
But that step

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,460
happens to be the hardest to take.

41
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,650
Master,

42
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,010
this is not her fault,

43
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,070
nor is it yours.

44
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,240
You see,

45
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,680
one cannot undo the past,

46
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,550
so it's no use clinging to it.

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,490
If what has happened is too messy to figure out,

48
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,690
then just leave it be.

49
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
The most important thing

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
is to live in the present day.

51
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,630
Just drink the wine you want now,

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,950
and meet

53
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,890
whoever you'd love to see.

54
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,950
Only when you live your life this way,

55
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,480
will you be free of regrets,

56
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,630
and make every second count.

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,010
Master, take your time with the mourning.

58
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,990
I'll wait for you over there.

59
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
The power of the Spirit Dispelling Formation is gone.

60
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
There is no more excuse for me

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,390
to stay with Master.

62
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,720
Tomorrow morning,

63
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,630
Master will probably ask me to go back to Mount Wester.

64
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,470
Meet whoever I'd love to see,

65
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
and make every second count.

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,950
Master told me to hold his hand.

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,000
His hand felt so soft!

68
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,630
I wish I could be struck by the Peach Blossom Intoxication

69
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,430
again.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,510
I haven't gotten a chance

71
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,250
to rub Master's cheeks.

72
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,070
Well,

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,720
do you think Master

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,830
likes me back?

75
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,230
If someone takes

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,210
just one more step forward,

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,330
everything will be different.

78
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,560
But that step

79
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,130
happens to be the hardest to take.

80
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,020
You are getting back

81
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,350
more and more memories.

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
You will finally recall

83
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,940
everything from the past.

84
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,990
Good times never last long.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,460
Why don't I indulge myself

86
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,159
for just one time?

87
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,450
Stiffly Su,

88
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,510
your emotions are all stirred up.

89
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,910
What are you trying to do?

90
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,960
I know this is not a wise decision.

91
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,030
That said,

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,130
I still want to do it.

93
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,600
But the effort you've put into practicing the Ice Lotus Technique

94
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,750
will go down the drain.

95
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,200
Then what will you have

96
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,410
to seal the Spirit Spring with?

97
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:28,960
Your life?

98
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,790
So what?

99
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,510
You're crazy, crazy!

100
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,440
You've absolutely lost your mind!

101
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,150
I...

102
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,750
Su Yishui!

103
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,670
Did you just destroy my precious

104
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,330
Teleportation Jade Pendant?

105
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,990
That previous "Break the Galaxy" attack

106
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,240
has drained much of my original spiritual power.

107
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,870
Now that I've taken precautions,

108
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,510
I'll be able to resist attacks of the same sort.

109
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,000
But if Qingge rises to a new level,

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,730
then I'll inevitably get hurt,

111
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,840
and lose a lot of power

112
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,670
to her.

113
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,440
You are born

114
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,620
to be my opponents!

115
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,940
I've formed a Golden Core.

116
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,290
I can be of help to Yu now!

117
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,720
Check this out.

118
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,670
What happened to me?

119
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,510
You've practiced too many quick-and-dirty techniques.

120
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,370
Various types of impure energy are repelling one another in the void

121
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,790
and causing a backlash on your body.

122
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,550
You must rid yourself of all the techniques.

123
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,860
[Heavenly Sect
Doctor]

124
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,840
Otherwise,

125
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,750
your life will be in danger.

126
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,200
No way!

127
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,720
I took great pains to finally form a Golden Core.

128
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,840
I can't give up now.

129
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,120
Tell me

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,910
what else I can do!

131
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,480
Well,

132
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,270
the other option is for you to use another person's spiritual power

133
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,670
to suppress the impure energy in your body.

134
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,910
But this...

135
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,400
is practically demonic cultivation.

136
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,000
You...

137
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,550
hate your sister.

138
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,360
I just want her to disappear.

139
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,910
With her around,

140
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,200
people will never notice me.

141
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,320
I must beat her down.

142
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,750
Your Golden Core is falling apart.

143
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,030
Your life is in danger.

144
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,130
How can you beat your sister down?

145
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,590
Then what should I do?

146
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,440
If you absorb her spiritual power,

147
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,120
you will survive.

148
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,690
Don't worry.

149
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,970
I'll make you stronger.

150
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,390
This Soul-Devouring Lock

151
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,720
will help you get

152
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,750
whatever she has.

153
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,630
In this life,

154
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,390
everything is already mine.

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
I won't let you take anything from me again!

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
The Resentment Liquid...

157
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
Because of my unstable spiritual power,

158
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,150
the Resentment Liquid is acting up.

159
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,880
But Su Yishui

160
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,360
has solved this problem for me, hasn't he?

161
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,000
You're not half bad.

162
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,790
The Resentment Liquid in you has been suppressed for a year.

163
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,990
Too bad that you can't escape your fate.

164
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,800
If you don't want to suffer,

165
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
come to meet me immediately.

166
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,750
Mu Qingge,

167
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,260
we're finally meeting again.

168
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,050
We're friends, Sovereign Wei.

169
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,950
There's no reason for me not to meet you.

170
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,030
You have never

171
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,160
taken me seriously.

172
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,880
But now,

173
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,570
you're saying we're friends.

174
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,150
Indeed,

175
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,890
the Resentment Liquid works better than anything.

176
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,870
Back on Mount Absolute,

177
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,150
I did mean to be cooperative

178
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,880
when you set up that formation,

179
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
but I was held back by too many concerns.

180
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,850
We could have had a discussion.

181
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,220
Why did you have to resort to the Resentment Liquid?

182
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
At that time, you were so righteous and tough.

183
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
It looked like

184
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,350
you and the Heavenly Sect were about to execute me.

185
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,360
I didn't know we could've had a discussion.

186
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,750
Fine.

187
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,210
What would you like to discuss?

188
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Like how to spend a wonderful night with me?

189
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,880
You're a sovereign.

190
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,600
Why are you making a joke like that?

191
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,240
You think I'm joking?

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,930
In your previous life, back in the capital,

193
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,960
you humiliated me in front of so many people.

194
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,690
Today, I'll make you pay for it!

195
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,550
Come on!

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,670
Beg me.

197
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,200
Then I'll free you from the Resentment Liquid.

198
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,790
No!

199
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
I've never seen

200
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,120
Mu Qingge beg anyone.

201
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll give you what you asked!

202
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:18,910
What?

203
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
But I need the deal to be documented!

204
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,650
What's wrong with you?

205
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,440
I just got it started and you've already surrendered?

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,430
In this new life of yours,

207
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,030
it's no fun to fight you at all.

208
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,750
So boring.

209
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,380
So you're just toying with me.

210
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
Then the Resentment Liquid in me...

211
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,440
If you do want to get rid of it,

212
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,950
you'll have to do my bidding from now on.

213
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,050
Sovereign,

214
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,240
I've only received a small portion of memories and spiritual power

215
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,570
from the previous life.

216
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm afraid I won't be of help to you.

217
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
You sure love making excuses, don't you?

218
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,450
I'm not lying to you!

219
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,890
Soul-Devouring Lock?

220
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,600
The Reincarnation Tree bore two pieces of fruit.

221
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,390
The other one

222
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,690
should be my sister, Mu Ranwu.

223
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,360
The fact that this Soul-Devouring Lock exists

224
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
means she is still alive.

225
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,100
I just don't know

226
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,380
her identity and whereabouts in this life.

227
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,320
But she did take away

228
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
part of my spiritual power and memories.

229
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,780
The other piece of Reincarnation Fruit is still alive?

230
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,390
Her spiritual sense is ruined,

231
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,250
and she's dead!

232
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,930
You've ruined my plan!

233
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,080
Smokescreen...

234
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,550
It's so vicious and foolish of your little sister.

235
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,320
If she had used the Soul-Devouring Lock

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
with caution,

237
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,240
she wouldn't have hurt herself.

238
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,960
Anyway,

239
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,270
about the Spirit Spring I'm looking for

240
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,270
and the fruit you're searching for,

241
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,030
we can discover clues from one person.

242
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
You mean Su Yishui?

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,080
The Reincarnation Tree

244
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
was formed by his Golden Core after all.

245
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
If the other piece of fruit is alive,

246
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,150
he surely knows something about it.

247
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,120
Now that we've talked about all that,

248
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,250
you'd better agree to partner with me.

249
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,360
Or do you think

250
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,910
you have a better choice?

251
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,840
I am ready

252
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,810
to do your bidding, Sovereign.

253
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,720
By the way,

254
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,720
the Crown Prince

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,400
has doubts about you.

256
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,810
Yu has sent someone to stalk me.

257
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,450
He has found me suspicious, hasn't he?

258
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,480
Qingge,

259
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,550
I will find you and kill you

260
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,210
before the truth is revealed.

261
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,550
Yu can only be mine.

262
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,829
Master,

263
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000
did you tell me to come here

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,510
because the Spirit Dispelling Formation has lost its effects

265
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,770
and you want me to return to Mount Wester?

266
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,920
I know

267
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,109
we've all had a good rest.

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,960
Next,

269
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,550
you're going to meet your friend

270
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,480
and try to find clues about the Seven Evil Transformation Spell.

271
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,880
But...

272
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,349
I want to go with you

273
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,480
to find out where the Spirit Spring is.

274
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,970
This is the only way I can

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
put Madam Wu's matter behind.

276
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,880
Are you done talking?

277
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,790
I asked you to come

278
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,920
because of the scenery here.

279
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,350
There used to be malicious energy at Wangxiang Pass.

280
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,830
Now that the malicious energy is gone,

281
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,690
this place has taken on a new look.

282
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,910
These night mayflies can purify spiritual energy,

283
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,200
which is good for cultivation.

284
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,530
Moreover, this scenery

285
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,240
is very similar to

286
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,400
a certain marvelous auspicious cloud phenomenon in the sky.

287
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,460
It's worth seeing.

288
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,400
I thought

289
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,880
you might want to see it.

290
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
So beautiful.

291
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,440
Wait.

292
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Master,

293
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,140
you're not asking me to leave?

294
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,520
Does it mean I can stay

295
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,880
and adventure with you?

296
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,540
You can stay.

297
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,160
Thank you, Master.

298
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Ranran,

299
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,070
I need to talk with your master

300
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,290
about an important issue.

301
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,820
Please go tell him I'm here.

302
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,650
Master Mu, you're a brutal killer.

303
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,360
I don't want anything to do with you.

304
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,750
You've made a big enough scene here.

305
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,880
If my master would like to meet you,

306
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,810
he will come out.

307
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,790
Here are some presents.

308
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,920
Please do us a favor.

309
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,530
You must be Mr. Wang Suizhi.

310
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,400
Did the former Wester Sect disciples

311
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,790
accept bribes?

312
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,070
Cut the nonsense!

313
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,500
You'd better be polite,

314
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,980
or I will take down this...

315
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,600
[Mu Ranwu's disciple
Lin Yeting]

316
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,040
Say what you want

317
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,680
and do not waste my time.

318
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,270
Shui,

319
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,920
I have something important to tell you.

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Can we have a word in private?

321
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,720
You're the only one I'd like to talk to.

322
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
It's about the Reincarnation Tree.

323
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,840
Come with me.

324
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,750
Isn't Grandmaster in love with Mr. Yu?

325
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,770
Why would she want a meeting with Master?

326
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,930
Ranran,

327
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,160
I think someone is jealous.

328
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Are you into...

329
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,000
I...

330
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,290
I'm going to shop for fish.

331
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,550
What do you want to know about the Reincarnation Tree?

332
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,880
The Reincarnation Tree

333
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,990
actually bore two pieces of fruit,

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,600
didn't it?

335
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,720
All I did was grow it with my Golden Core.

336
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,510
How am I supposed to know

337
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,400
how many pieces of fruit it bore?

338
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,880
If there was a second piece of fruit,

339
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,750
you would know best

340
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,310
since you grew on the same tree, right?

341
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,680
Before I was born,

342
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,030
I had sensed the existence

343
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,490
of another piece of fruit.

344
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,440
That sounds odd.

345
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,070
What little spiritual power I had

346
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,860
could only support one person's reincarnation.

347
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,190
You've turned out well.

348
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,000
That means you must have absorbed

349
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,420
most of the spiritual power.

350
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,880
If there was another girl,

351
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,320
could she have survived?

352
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,110
So you know nothing about it?

353
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm not interested in it, either.

354
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,120
The curse between me and Mount Wester has been lifted.

355
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,510
I have nothing to do with any other issue.

356
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,200
Goodbye.

357
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,380
Hold on!

358
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,270
A year ago, you rid me of the Resentment Liquid.

359
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,670
Why is it acting up again?

360
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,440
The Resentment Liquid has stronger Yin energy

361
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,550
than any other thing in the universe.

362
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,900
It was formed after years of fermentation in the Abysmal Abyss.

363
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm only able to suppress it,

364
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,680
not to completely eliminate it.

365
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,520
I didn't make it clear back then,

366
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,550
but now I've explained it to you.

367
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,590
A temporary fix will do.

368
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,790
I'm feeling so much pain...

369
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,070
The spiritual medicine has run out.

370
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,470
There's nothing I can do.

371
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,110
You should ask Yu.

372
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,940
I bet he can give you an answer.

373
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,200
Shui,

374
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,550
do you still hate Yu?

375
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,940
Actually, since my rebirth,

376
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
it has always been you

377
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,370
who I truly care about.

378
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,370
Do you remember?

379
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,510
In my previous life, when my hand was injured,

380
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,750
you made an ointment for me.

381
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,150
Your innermost thoughts

382
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,330
are no secret to me.

383
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,240
You should have told me earlier.

384
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,730
You must be having a misunderstanding.

385
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,070
As you said, that happened in your previous life.

386
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,240
It has nothing to do with this life of yours.

387
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,480
You're lucky to have started a new life, so cherish it.

388
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,270
Don't let down those

389
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,590
who wish you well.

390
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,790
Are you gonna sit back and watch

391
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,520
the Resentment Liquid kill me?

392
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,680
You've always been a resourceful woman.

393
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,790
You would do

394
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,030
whatever it takes

395
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,160
to get what you want.

396
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,200
Since this is a life-threatening problem,

397
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
I believe you'll find a cure.

398
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,530
Am I wrong about

399
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,600
his feelings for Qingge in the previous life,

400
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,310
or is it true

401
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,100
that Qingge has been hidden by him?

402
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,750
Now that this is the case,

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,860
I hope you won't blame me for teaming up with Wei Jiu.

404
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,710
Sir,

405
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,160
why are you closing business so early?

406
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,640
Miss,

407
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,240
I usually sell fish in the morning.

408
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,100
Today's fish have sold out by now.

409
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay.

410
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,620
Ranran.

411
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,320
Mr. Yu.

412
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,210
Do you want to buy fish?

413
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,880
Come aboard my boat.

414
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm going to check the waterways at Wangxiang Pass.

415
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
I can take you to the middle of the river

416
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,720
where you can catch some fresh fish.

417
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

418
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,970
Let's go.

419
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,590
Mr. Yu sure is handsome,

420
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,680
but Master is more charming

421
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,350
owing to his unworldly face.

422
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,030
Ranran,

423
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,720
listen,

424
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,610
I have an old friend

425
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,610
who I had missed dearly

426
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
but hadn't seen in years.

427
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,970
I racked my brains to find a way

428
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,240
to reunite with her.

429
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,250
But when I met her again,

430
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,070
I felt despondent.

431
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,990
It is odd, isn't it?

432
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,350
The friend you're talking about

433
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,480
is Master Mu, right?

434
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
I shouldn't share

435
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,720
such kind of things with others.

436
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,750
I don't know why,

437
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,590
but I always find myself telling you my thoughts

438
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,850
without realizing it.

439
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,950
Confiding your troubles to someone

440
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,480
would make you feel better.

441
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,340
Just speak your mind.

442
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,670
I'll be a good listener.

443
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,410
When I was young,

444
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,650
I went with my father to provide famine relief.

445
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,910
We helped many people.

446
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,650
Only a little girl

447
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,810
said she'd repay me.

448
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,360
In those chaotic times,

449
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,640
anyone's survival would be a miracle.

450
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,200
So I didn't take her promise seriously at the time.

451
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,060
Unexpectedly,

452
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,290
eight years after that,

453
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,740
she did show up.

454
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,110
Later on,

455
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,600
the Spirit Spring appeared,

456
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,640
and I learned that she died.

457
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,080
In the 18 years after her death,

458
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,270
I kept paying annual visits to Mount Absolute

459
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,670
for any news about the Reincarnation Tree.

460
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,160
I swore a million times

461
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,640
that if I could start it all over again,

462
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,090
I would protect Qingge with all my might.

463
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Fortunately,

464
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,240
Master Mu has come back to life now.

465
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,270
Yes.

466
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,280
Qingge is back and alive now.

467
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,050
But for some reason,

468
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,440
I feel

469
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,410
that she is different from before.

470
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,790
Perhaps that's what happens when one's dream

471
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,720
finally comes true after years of waiting.

472
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,050
But what does it matter?

473
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,590
All is fine as long as you and Master Mu

474
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,850
care about each other.

475
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,100
Life is uneventful in its nature.

476
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,960
Maybe after a while, you'll realize

477
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,750
that simple companionship

478
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,110
is the most precious.

479
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,020
You're right.

480
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,420
Ranran,

481
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,830
thank you.

482
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,880
Anytime.

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,460
We're friends, remember?

484
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,590
Your Highness,

485
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,320
these are freshly caught fish.

486
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,070
Why don't I make a novel dish

487
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,070
to cheer you up?

488
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,590
Okay.

489
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,680
This is my chance to try cooking this dish.

490
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,880
I'll make it again for Master back home.

491
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,340
Here comes the final step.

492
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,790
This dish

493
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,270
is called "Getting Drunk in River in Broad Daylight."

494
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,960
I learned it from the Collection of Entertainment.

495
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,890
The Collection of Entertainment?

496
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,640
This is...

497
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,810
Qingge's handwriting.

498
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,680
I

499
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,030
discovered it in Mount Wester.

500
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,730
Master said I could keep it.

501
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,350
Mr. Yu,

502
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,680
you won't give it to Master Mu, will you?

503
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,750
I won't.

504
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,000
That's a relief!

505
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,830
It records so much fun stuff.

506
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,490
This is my own treasure chest.

507
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,680
Su Yishui

508
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,830
said you could keep it?

509
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Yes.

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,920
This book contains

511
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,320
much of Su Yishui's past.

512
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,010
It's unusual for him

513
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,240
to give it away. What changed him?

514
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Mr. Yu.

515
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,550
Mr. Yu?

516
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,130
Aren't you gonna give it back to me?

517
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,490
Your master is very nice to you.

518
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,400
Of course.

519
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
But sometimes

520
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,810
he is very harsh.

521
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
Would he be harsh on you?

522
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,590
Sure thing.

523
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,070
When I was new to Mount Wester,

524
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,590
he punished me quite often.

525
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,310
Nonetheless,

526
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,800
since I got the Collection of Entertainment,

527
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,830
I've figured out quite a few ways

528
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,830
to please Master.

529
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,830
Part of the writing is inaccurate, though.

530
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,510
For example,

531
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,880
the salt-preserved dried longan written in it

532
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,680
doesn't appeal to his appetite.

533
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,160
Salt-preserved dried longan

534
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,820
is popular among poor people.

535
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,380
Its sweetness is too light

536
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,750
compared to its sourness and bitterness.

537
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,400
I think that's the kind of snack his mother made him

538
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,860
before he moved to Prince Ping's residence.

539
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,640
Now I understand why there was dried longan

540
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,240
beside his swaddling cloth.

541
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,480
Your Master was sold

542
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,960
to Prince Ping's residence by his own mother.

543
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Judging from his temperament,

544
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,590
he takes dried longan with him

545
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,320
so it can constantly remind him

546
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,830
to achieve more than most others

547
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,960
and to seek revenge.

548
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,030
No.

549
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,310
I think

550
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,450
Master values

551
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,210
this mother-son relationship more than anyone.

552
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,270
You seem to know a lot about your master.

553
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,210
Let's change the topic.

554
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,790
Mr. Yu,

555
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,090
have some fish soup.

556
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,370
Surprisingly,

557
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,640
the soup she made

558
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,400
tastes the same as that made by Qingge.

559
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,930
So does the wine she brewed.

560
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,110
Ranran,

561
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,550
we've known each other for a long time,

562
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,720
but I haven't heard much

563
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
about your story.

564
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
Tell me more about yourself.

565
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,510
The fish you cooked is delicious.

566
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,720
I had great fun today.

567
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
Next time when you come to the capital,

568
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,920
don't forget to visit me in the royal palace.

569
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,790
I would love to

570
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,200
show you a good time.

571
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,480
Miss, hold on!

572
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,270
This is a gift from His Highness.

573
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,350
It's token of appreciation.

574
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,350
Please do take it.

575
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,720
No need for this.

576
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,070
I only made some ordinary dishes.

577
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,710
Mr. Yu doesn't need to give me a gift.

578
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,960
Miss, just do me favor and accept it.

579
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,350
You solved a major case for the military.

580
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,070
For that,

581
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,200
we already owe you a lot.

582
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,830
Or do you

583
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,650
actually want something else?

584
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,130
Alright, alright.

585
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,120
Thank you.

586
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,160
Yu,

587
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,220
it is late at night now.

588
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,470
How can I help you?

589
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,720
Previously, I asked you

590
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,570
to make a Health Pill

591
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,720
to boost my father's health.

592
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,980
It has been over a year.

593
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,560
Have you finished it yet?

594
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,360
I'll go get it right now.

595
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,200
I've completed the inspection of the waterways

596
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
at Wangxiang Pass today.

597
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,270
We'll set out for the next destination tomorrow.

598
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,800
You should have a good rest.

599
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,830
It just came to my mind

600
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,680
that I have a personal affair to deal with.

601
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm afraid I can't be with you tomorrow.

602
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,510
When it's done,

603
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,850
I'll come find you.

604
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:49,960
Okay.

605
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,260
How is the quality?

606
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,030
The lowest kind.

607
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,860
Due to unstable power?

608
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,480
It has nothing to do with power.

609
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
Poor talent is the reason.

610
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,310
Your Highness,

611
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,750
we got some news from the capital.

612
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,550
Someone cast a Nightmare Curse on Concubine Zhou.

613
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,920
If it weren't for the protective jade,

614
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,510
she might have been killed.

615
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,230
Who did it?

616
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,440
It was Madam Mu's order.

617
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,130
Maybe Madam Mu

618
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,880
cares too much about Your Highness,

619
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,830
so she got jealous of Concubine Zhou

620
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,200
and took extreme action.

621
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,860
Besides...

622
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Besides what?

623
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,970
I saw Madam Mu meet

624
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,510
with the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu today.

625
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,370
But I don't know what that was for.

626
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,920
I see.

627
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,110
Inspecting all the waterways

628
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,240
is our top priority.

629
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,160
Anything else can wait.

630
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,310
Keep doing your job of protecting Qingge.

631
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,750
Yes.

632
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,450
After several days of care,

633
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,960
you've finally expelled some poison out of your system.

634
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
You need to take some more pills,

635
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
and get more rest.

636
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,350
Our master's friend who knows about talismans

637
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,410
is in Mount Cuiwei.

638
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,880
God knows how many days this trip will take.

639
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,280
Let's go.

640
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,750
Yes.

641
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,830
Master,

642
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,240
aren't we gonna say goodbye

643
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,960
to Mr. Yu?

644
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,440
He already left.

645
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,890
He didn't, did he?

646
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,790
Just now, I saw

647
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,640
the Crown Prince's flag

648
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,300
hoisted at the camp entrance.

649
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,080
What about Mr. Qin?

650
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,040
Come on. Just go.

651
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,150
[Leisure]

652
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,450
This is Mount Cuiwei, isn't it?

653
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,740
What a beautiful place!

654
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm curious about Master's

655
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,390
mysterious friend.

656
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,200
Su Yishui requests a meeting with Alcohol Immortal.

657
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,750
Who?

658
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,750
Su Yishui.

659
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,830
Su Yishui is a punk.

660
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,250
Your request is denied!

661
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,510
Master,

662
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,270
is this friend of yours

663
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,720
feuding with you?

664
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,450
He often drank alcohol with Mu Qingge in her last life.

665
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,270
He's the world's top talisman guru.

666
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,930
This is bad.

667
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,090
He is not really a friend of Master's,

668
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,280
but Grandmaster's.

669
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
I don't think he'll let us in.

670
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,900
Mr. Alcohol Immortal,

671
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,270
my master is asking to meet you

672
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,310
because there are demons hurting people.

673
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,310
He is not here for a personal affair.

674
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,960
My grandmaster Mu Qingge

675
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,270
has already reincarnated and started a new life.

676
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,480
We saw her yesterday.

677
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,680
Why do you have to dwell on the past?

678
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,030
Forget it, Ranran.

679
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,680
A drunkard like him

680
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,070
probably can't hear

681
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,160
anything you say.

682
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,410
Such a failure!

683
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Failure!

684
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,920
Your name is Alcohol Immortal,

685
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,310
but the wine you brewed is not as good as Mistaken Divine.

686
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,270
What a failure!

687
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,510
You've tasted Mistaken Divine?

688
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,440
I've not only tasted it,

689
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,040
but I also know how to make it.

690
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,400
Try some.

691
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,440
Yes!

692
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,370
It is Mistaken Divine.

693
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
And it's freshly brewed!

694
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,360
You...

695
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Where did you get this?

696
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,350
As you said, it's freshly brewed.

697
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,920
This is my creation, of course.

698
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,050
That's impossible!

699
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,900
I dare you to

700
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,400
write me the recipe!

701
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,380
Easy peasy.

702
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,640
My master

703
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,030
would like a meeting with you.

704
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,070
If you agree to meet him,

705
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,340
I'll not only give you the recipe,

706
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,240
but also help you

707
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,830
brew a jar of Mistaken Divine.

708
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,240
But if you disagree,

709
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,740
I'll have to leave with my master.

710
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,320
Come on in!

711
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,370
Thank you, sir!

712
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,130
Speak your mind.

713
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,240
The Seven Evil Transformation Spell?

714
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,830
How did you get it?

715
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,910
Someone at Wangxiang Pass was cursed by this spell.

716
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,190
There was malicious energy around the waterways.

717
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,630
I guess

718
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,440
it was done by the Spirit Spring

719
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,699
when it made an attempt to break the seal.

720
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,110
Years ago,

721
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,840
you people killed Mu

722
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,679
and the Spirit Spring went missing.

723
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,440
If it still exists in the mortal world,

724
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,100
it could've done what you said

725
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,210
though many years have passed.

726
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,230
The Spirit Spring infused the river

727
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,560
with malicious energy,

728
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,850
found those holding grudges,

729
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,010
and demonized them with the Seven Evil Transformation Spell,

730
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,000
so they could kill innocent people for the spring

731
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,840
and accumulate more malicious energy.

732
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,969
It's the Mortal-Demon Lord's tactic.

733
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,770
You're good-looking

734
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,630
and smart.

735
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,600
It's no wonder Mu would fall for your trick.

736
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,130
Now that you've solved

737
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,210
most of the puzzle,

738
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,270
why would you want to meet me?

739
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,989
I only know the Spirit Spring's purpose,

740
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,190
but not its location.

741
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,400
I came here to ask you

742
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,710
to track down the Spirit Spring

743
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,480
based on this Seven Evil Transformation Spell.

744
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,940
There isn't a useful lead.

745
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
This spell alone

746
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,100
can't help me find out who cast the curse.

747
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,790
That said,

748
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,360
I do have an idea.

749
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,030
What idea?

750
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,360
The Spirit Spring is related to Mu.

751
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,030
Something with her spiritual energy attached

752
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,990
could lead us

753
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,270
to the Spirit Spring.

754
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,000
Sir,

755
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,800
I brewed a new pot of Mistaken Divine.

756
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,480
Already?

757
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,210
I have my own way.

758
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,260
Master,

759
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,370
how is it going?

760
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,880
The Spirit Spring is sealed by her Golden Core.

761
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,550
Perhaps

762
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,910
she can sense the Spirit Spring.

763
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,320
But...

764
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,820
Anyway,

765
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,880
our lives have been entangled.

766
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,610
Maybe I should end this with her

767
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,210
so I can put all the worries behind sooner.

768
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,540
Alcohol Immortal,

769
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,800
please allow the two of us

770
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,060
to stay a few days here.

771
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,410
You're really pushing your luck, lad.

772
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,150
Sir,

773
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
if you let us stay,

774
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,330
I'll make you

775
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,890
whatever you want to drink.

776
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,770
You're so luck to have this disciple.

777
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,110
Master, are you saying

778
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,040
that I can sense the Spirit Spring?

779
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,510
When Mu Qingge sealed the Spirit Spring,

780
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,440
a trail of her spiritual power was left.

781
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,800
She and you grew on the same tree.

782
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,320
Your spiritual power and hers were connected.

783
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Maybe you can also sense the spring.

784
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,360
When Master mentioned Mu Qingge,

785
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,360
he didn't seem

786
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,710
to be emotional.

787
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,090
Well...

788
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,610
Master, tell me how to sense it.

789
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,480
Show the tree now.

790
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I will protect you

791
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,960
to make sure you are not interrupted

792
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,160
when you release your spiritual power.

793
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,360
Try your best to detect

794
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,870
where there has the strongest malicious energy.

795
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,870
which happens to resonate with your spiritual power.

796
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,840
Release your spiritual power.

797
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,170
Close your eyes to feel.

798
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,580
Focus up and stay calm.

799
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm feeling it.

800
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,240
The Spirit Spring is in the southeast.

801
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,510
You guys

802
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,110
were wounded by demonic poison

803
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,440
and have not fully recovered.

804
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,630
You should take a rest here and expel the poison.

805
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,890
We'll set out in 5 days.

806
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,230
Yes.

807
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,880
About the Spirit Spring,

808
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,510
don't tell others what we found.

809
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,040
Or they might make hasty and wrong decisions.

810
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,230
Is it a secret

811
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,230
only between you and me?

812
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,840
Yes.

813
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,620
Let's go.

814
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,460
It's time for practice and detoxification.

815
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,630
Ling Xiao,

816
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,550
Master has treated me

817
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,590
very gently and differently these days,

818
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,550
hasn't he?

819
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,620
Master knows my feelings for him, right?

820
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,560
What exactly

821
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,880
is he thinking?

822
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,480
That's Su Yishui's disciple.

823
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,280
If we capture him,

824
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,940
we'll know Su Yishui's plans.

825
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,160
Su Yishui is a cautious man.

826
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,630
He doesn't easily disclose

827
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,690
important matters to his disciples.

828
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,110
Now this disciple of his

829
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,070
is alone here.

830
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,150
Why don't we turn him

831
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,710
into our bait

832
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,920
to get Su Yishui on the hook?

833
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,840
Mu Qingge,

834
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,030
in this new life of yours,

835
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,880
you've become more cunning.

836
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,710
Now you can think of ruses and scams

837
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,710
faster than I can.

838
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,190
We'd better go after him now.

839
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,280
[A market at the foot of Mount Cuiwei]

840
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,360
Go away!

841
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,030
Hurry up!

842
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,030
Leave!

843
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,710
Listen up,

844
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,890
our pawn shop

845
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,810
is no home for

846
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,570
crappy junk.

847
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,480
You...

848
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,510
This is a top-tier item for sword cultivators.

849
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,670
It's a Sword Heart Pill!

850
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,000
You ignorant fool!

851
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,280
Sword Heart Pill?

852
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,440
My friend,

853
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,850
is it true

854
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,460
that this is a top-tier Sword Heart Pill

855
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,550
that helps sword cultivators

856
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,920
quickly make progress?

857
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,360
I can tell

858
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,220
that you have a good eye for nice stuff.

859
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,550
To know if the pill is true,

860
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,630
just sniff it.

861
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,700
I wouldn't sell it to someone else

862
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,900
if I weren't in desperate need of money.

863
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,880
I believe

864
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,800
you're a sophisticated man

865
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,190
with many talents.

866
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm sure you know how good this pill is.

867
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,400
It's fate that brought us here today.

868
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,460
I'll only charge you 8 taels of silver

869
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,620
for this

870
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Sword Heart Pill.

871
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,690
I think it'll be in good hands.

872
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,210
It is indeed a good pill.

873
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,130
But my master forbids me

874
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,070
from taking other pills

875
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,600
than those made in the sect.

876
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,800
What a shame!

877
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,050
Give it to me.

878
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,940
I'll buy it.

879
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,300
It's yours now.

880
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,440
If I eat this pill at the foot of the mountain,

881
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,170
Master might not figure it out.

882
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,440
Sir...

883
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,670
Sir...

884
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,510
Are you okay?

885
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,030
You're sweating a lot, sir.

886
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,630
Sir,

887
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,510
I have a tea house

888
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,070
right in front.

889
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,150
Why don't you come with me and have some tea

890
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,520
to beat the heat?

891
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,070
Stop stealing food!

892
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,920
A spiritual soul is attached to this vine, right?

893
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,590
A spiritual soul that was detached

894
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,000
from the body over 20 years ago.

895
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,730
How strange.

896
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,320
Why hasn't it disappeared yet?

897
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,840
What did you use to keep it alive?

898
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,700
What are you...

899
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,230
No, that's not right.

900
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,840
Even if it is nourished with the Blood Chalcedony,

901
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,970
it shouldn't have such strong energy.

902
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,320
Could it be...

903
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,760
Ranran!

904
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,590
Just a misunderstanding!

905
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,190
Calm down.

906
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,920
Calm down.

907
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,830
Liang Wumeng,

908
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,670
you're injured and having a secluded session.

909
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,460
Shouldn't you be resting and recovering

910
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,120
instead of making a mess here?

911
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,280
You wanna die or what?

912
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,080
Liang Wumeng?

913
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,880
Master Liang!

914
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,570
Please help me.

915
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,030
Alright, young lady.

916
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,960
No need to beg me.

917
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,960
Young lady,

918
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,070
I'm starting to take a liking to you.
