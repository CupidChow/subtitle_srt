00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,080
will

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to travel between the north and the west.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of it.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am destined to be the one to give my life for the love.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I still have no fear or regret.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When the light is out, the fallen flowers are in full bloom.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am destined to be the one to give my life for the love.

Episode 15

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is this what you said about being fine?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's just a little bit of cold poison.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's okay.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It will be fine tomorrow.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will be fine.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will be fine.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are fine now.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You...

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You waited all night?

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If I leave because I am injured,

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you will be the one to blame for the cold poison.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Xiao Shui is really a kind person.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have done everything I should. Go back quickly.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No rush.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have something special today.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You don't remember what day it is?

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's your birthday.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Teacher needs to celebrate it for you.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No need.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am not interested in such a boring thing.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will let you go out and rest for a day.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want it either.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I will let you out of the jade butterfly

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and have a happy day.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can go wherever you want.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Go.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Qingge,

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the disciple you said you wanted to take

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
is Su Yishui?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This guy is really talented.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He thought he could get the elixir in five years,

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
but he broke the bottleneck in three years.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Qingge,

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
he is the son of Prince of Pingqing.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You said the Xuan family can't participate in the royal family affairs.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But why did you take Su Yishui as your disciple?

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
As my disciple,

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I won't be involved in the royal family affairs.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why not?

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
His Majesty hasn't established a state yet,

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and he is in need of help.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Father and Prince of Pingqing will fight for him sooner or later.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Su Yishui will help Prince of Pingqing.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is not a man who can survive in such a struggle.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Survive in a struggle?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Father and Prince of Pingqing haven't fought yet.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I went to find the prince who was out of town.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is also the son of the royal family.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Father scolded me for a day

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and asked me to meet him.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Greetings, Uncle.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who knew Prince of Pingqing said that the new prince was not feeling well.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was sick and couldn't see him.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So my father and Prince of Pingqing had tea and talked.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was too young to sit still.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I sneaked out and wandered around the palace.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I broke into the back garden.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I heard a strange sound here.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I went to check it out.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I knew that the young man was Su Yishui.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I didn't expect that Xiao Shui was so pitiful.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After experiencing these,

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
no matter what kind of person he is, he will be destroyed by Prince of Pingqing.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Brother, I'm afraid that you will be honest

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and bring someone to the moment when he is bitten by a bat.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sister, the prince is right.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have to be careful.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Prince of Pingqing brought him here

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to make him into a killing knife.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But now, this knife has entered the West Mountain.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will put the cold in his throat

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and don't let him hurt people or people.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What if he is not as you wish?

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Prince of Pingqing

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Prince of Pingqing

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Young Master, did you just get lazy?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I saw you getting lazy.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I let you get lazy.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let you get lazy.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Get out!

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is my house!

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I let you get lazy.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I let you get lazy.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why did I give birth to you?

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't come back again, okay?

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Prince of Pingqing

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Xiao Bao, I prepared a gift for you.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go and have a look.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, let's go.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's go.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Prince of Pingqing

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Prince of Pingqing

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you doing here?

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Your father and I have already won the silver and silver.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We have no relationship anymore.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Today, Xiao Bao entered the school

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and had a happy day.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who?

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You should leave far away.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't come and poison me again.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Prince of Pingqing

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Look who is here.

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Isn't this the father who hasn't seen you for ten years?

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why did you give up your son?

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I fed him and raised him.

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can't take him away.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You should make up for it.

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not a prostitute.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is not enough.

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you want?

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let me go.

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Forty-four jin, eleven taels.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Look, it's so heavy.

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I have to pay thirty taels of silver.

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yang Zhi, Bai Yu.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can make another house.

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, that's enough.

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Take him away.

141
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mother, I'm afraid you will hurt me again.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I won't do it again.

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let me go back.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When can you wait?

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's your turn to pay.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mother.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You have two options.

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
One, wait for your death at the door.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Two, get in the car and go home with me.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Mother.

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mother, I'm so tired. I can't.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm not patient.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll count to three.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
One.

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Mother, I'm so weak.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I only eat one meal a day.

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't afford to pay.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Two.

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Three.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mother.

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Mother, open the door.

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mother.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mother, open the door.

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Mother.

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's something in her hand.

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Give it to me.

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Give it to me.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's mine.

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's mine.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Here, take it.

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Put it on.

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's too cold.

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Here, hold on.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're almost home.

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's cold.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's go.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll help you.

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Liu.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Mother.

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're back.

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's this?

183
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Look.

184
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Red noodle.

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a pity that it's dried.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It tastes good.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Mother.

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No.

189
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't have a home.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mother.

193
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Fire.

194
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Get some water.

195
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Get some water.

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Get some water.

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Get some water.

198
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Get some water.

199
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Open the door.

200
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I told you to keep it closed.

201
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You have to keep the door open.

202
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The wind is strong.

203
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Open the door.

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes.

205
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,640
She finally went home.

206
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Wait for me to disperse and return your life to me

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I will return your favor immediately

208
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Gradually, my heart is locked in love

209
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you looking at? Let's go

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But, words are hard to say

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I should just be by your side

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
For a moment, I finally know when there is a limit in the world

213
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Maybe we met because of the time

214
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Maybe the time is too short and too short

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's why I give you and me this round

216
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Using our fate as a bridge

217
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
To exchange for an endless face

218
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Maybe we met yesterday

219
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There is still a long way to go

220
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Using the long world to make it come true

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's make our wish come true

222
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Reunite again

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's still hot. Hurry and eat

224
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I made you birthday noodles

225
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm not hungry

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What about the gift? Do you want it?

227
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm not hungry

228
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What is this?

229
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What is this?

230
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Come on

231
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Throw it in the soil

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hurry up

233
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Hurry up

234
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What do you think? Do you like it?

235
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's just a tree

236
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Xiao Shui, you are wrong

237
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Trees are not planted randomly

238
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Spring has a green heart, summer has a wind

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Spring has a green heart, summer has a wind

241
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Autumn has fruit, winter has firewood

242
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
In the morning, the birds are singing

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
In the afternoon, the shade is getting darker

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
In the evening, the wind blows

245
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We drink and chat under the tree

246
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
When there is a tree in front of a house

247
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not just a house

248
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a house

249
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How is it? Are you feeling better?

250
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Enjoying the tree

251
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Drink

252
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't drink

253
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Wine is the best thing in the world

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Take a sip

255
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ok, I drink it myself

256
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The first sip is for the present

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Wish Xiao Shui a happy birthday

258
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Good wine

259
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The second sip is for the past

260
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wish you and me don't feel sad for the past

261
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The new sweet fruit

262
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We only eat sweet and don't eat bitter

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't need sweet

264
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Sweetness will make people forget

265
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Bitterness will be remembered

266
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I just need bitter

267
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It reminds me never to forget

268
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not worth it

269
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
People are so generous

270
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's ok if you have suffered a lot

271
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You can choose

272
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why bother yourself?

273
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
How about this?

274
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When we meet unhappy things

275
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We can have a good drink

276
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Call your brothers and sisters

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Squeeze the unhappiness out

278
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Call them now

279
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Mo Qing

280
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You don't know my past

281
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You don't know what kind of person I am

282
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't need someone to make plans for me

283
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't be nice to me

284
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Tell me

285
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What kind of person you were

286
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What kind of person you want to be

287
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What kind of person you want to be

288
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I want to be the highest being in the world

289
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I want to make those who despise me

290
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Kneel in front of me

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Please spare their lives

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If you are as cruel as you said

293
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You won't leave the fate of the second son of the royal family

294
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't kill because I don't want my father to punish me

295
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I have my own arrangement

296
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So you want to trick the king of Ping

297
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I have to be more cruel than others

298
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I can put pressure on them

299
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If you don't want to be manipulated in this world

300
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
There is only one way to go, no choice

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Actually when I was a kid

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I almost walked the evil road

303
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That year, there was a famine

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The mountain bandits wanted me to poison the well in the village

305
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I had food as long as I was down

306
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I didn't want to go down

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But my sister was hungry for several days

308
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It snowed that night

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I thought about it

310
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If it was a frost

311
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The innocent will die

312
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If not

313
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
My sister and I will die

314
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So you poisoned

315
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I ran out in the snow night behind my sister

316
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I thought I would die like this

317
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But I survived after I left

318
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Xiaoshui

319
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Sometimes people are like flies in a box

320
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I thought I was lost

321
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But once I went out

322
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I knew the world was vast

323
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
There is always a choice

324
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You have already left the mansion of the king of Ping

325
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I will help you find the second way

326
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I asked around

327
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No one was kidnapped except me

328
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You care about me so much

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Is it because of Su Yu

330
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You walked very close before

331
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I said it earlier

332
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because you are a martial arts root

333
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I want you to teach me to paint

334
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Teach me martial arts

335
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So I can eat and play every day

336
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Lying down and thinking about it

337
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I want you to teach me to paint

338
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Eat and play every day

339
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Lying down and thinking about it

340
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Such a good life

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You can't

342
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You are really boring

343
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Drink

344
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Drink

345
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Drink

346
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
No wonder you don't drink

347
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This kid is drunk

348
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Su's brother is in a good mood today

349
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It seems like another person

350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The little chickens in the right garden

351
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I have a good relationship with Su

352
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Really

353
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Focus on painting

354
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What to paint

355
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What to paint

356
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Strange

357
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You want to take the elixir

358
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But there is something in the spiritual platform

359
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You have been seriously injured

360
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Or have you been hit by any strange magic

361
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I put this spiritual power into your heart

362
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No

363
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Maybe there is a breath of heaven in the body

364
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Influence cultivation

365
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The valley in the west is called Xifeng Valley

366
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Stable spiritual power

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You go first, I'll come later

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm going to take a break

369
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going to take a break

370
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm going to take a break

371
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm going to take a break

372
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm going to take a break

373
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm going to take a break

374
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm going to take a break

375
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm going to take a break

376
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to take a break

377
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm going to take a break

378
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm going to take a break

379
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm going to take a break

380
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm going to take a break

381
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm going to take a break

382
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Take this elixir

383
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Take a break

384
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This elixir I just made is very bitter

385
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Drink it with this dragon eye liver

386
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I added the liver grass

387
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Stable spiritual power

388
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll help you get the elixir

389
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's done

390
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's the elixir

391
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Xiao Shui finally got the elixir

392
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Not the demon elixir

393
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Xiao Shui

394
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You are now the elixir cultivator

395
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Help me get the elixir to the soul

396
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's a small matter

397
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What's wrong with your hand

398
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I just picked the immortal grass

399
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I just picked the immortal grass

400
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's hard to pick the immortal grass

401
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Thank you

402
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The sun came out in the west

403
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Xiao Shui would say thank you

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Actually

405
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What I want to hear now is not

406
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Xiao Shui

407
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Xiao Shui

408
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Xiao Shui

409
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Xiao Shui

410
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Xiao Shui

411
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Xiao Shui

412
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What I want to hear now is not thank you

413
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What do you want to hear

414
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I've been up the mountain for so many years

415
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Should I call me a master

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
My hands are hurt

417
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Power loss

418
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I can't change my life

419
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Master

420
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Okay

421
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Good boy

422
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Senior Su

423
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You are so quiet

424
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Not going to the valley for a few days

425
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I've been grinding medicine all day

426
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What's the use of the elixir

427
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What's the use of the elixir

428
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I

429
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
My hands are hurt

430
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Do not move, let me see

431
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Not bad

432
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm sorry

433
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm sorry

434
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry

435
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Can't I be a good boy

436
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm sorry

437
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm sorry

438
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm sorry

439
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry

440
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry

441
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Xiao Shui, what's the matter

442
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The medicine on your hand

443
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Su Yishui?

444
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,200
Yes.

445
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,000
A person like Su Yishui

446
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
would personally make ointment for you.

447
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
And she made a mistake in front of the door.

448
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
She must have fallen for you.

449
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
No wonder you

450
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,000
would be accused of being a disciple of Jiuhua Sect.

451
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,000
And you allowed her to do whatever she wanted in the West Mountain.

452
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
How can you not let her

453
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
have a good life with you?

454
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
I'm not a good person.

455
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
I'm not a good person.

456
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
How can I not let her

457
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
have a good life with me?

458
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,600
But what I'm most afraid of is...

459
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What?

460
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,000
You're good to your disciple.

461
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,800
But you're not as good as Su Yishui.

462
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,600
Could it be that you also...

463
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
You're so easy-going.

464
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
How could you be so selfish?

465
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
Otherwise, I would have asked my mother

466
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,600
to go to the West Mountain to propose.

467
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I've always left the position of the Crown Princess to her.

468
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,600
How can you force yourself to do such a thing?

469
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
It's only worth it

470
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,400
if you can pretend to be the person in front of you.

471
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Guards.

472
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Yes.

473
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Send my order.

474
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
From today,

475
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Zhao Mu will be able to go to the West Mountain.

476
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,600
You should build a palace for Qingge.

477
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
The name is...

478
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Lingxi Palace.

479
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Yes.

480
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
The water-climbing platform...

481
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Lingxi is better.

482
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
I think...

483
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Lingxi is better.

484
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,600
Mu Qingge.

485
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
What are you doing?

486
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Prince Zong Qing and his son, Su Yu,

487
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,200
are going to build Lingxi Palace for us.

488
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm not doing this for money.

489
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm just doing it for fun.

490
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Yu has already spent the money.

491
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
It's not good for his goodwill.

492
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Zeng Yi, you should stay and take care of the family.

493
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
You, come with me.

494
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Go?

495
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,000
We'll go to the capital and do something important.

496
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
De Weixuan, eat while it's hot.

497
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Is this the important thing you want to do?

498
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,600
Isn't eating and drinking important?

499
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,200
This is delicious.

500
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,200
Xiao Yu said it's better than what the imperial cook cooked.

501
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
Why should I eat something recommended by others?

502
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Okay.

503
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Then I'll eat what Master recommended.

504
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Okay.

505
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,800
I'll eat it.

506
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay.

507
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll eat it.

508
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'll eat it.

509
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I'll eat it.

510
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
Then what Master recommended is okay, right?

511
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
This book of Play of the Golden Snake

512
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,600
is a collection of your master's

513
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
life-long efforts.

514
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,200
Let me show you one by one.

515
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
You wrote a book just for eating and drinking?

516
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,800
You can't be careless when eating and drinking.

517
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
The so-called world is full of delicious food.

518
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
Only then can you learn the essence of the great road.

519
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,400
Come on.

520
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,200
After eating this,

521
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
Master will take you around the capital.

522
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Come on.

523
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,000
Boss, I want a fried pork belly.

524
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
It's just cooked.

525
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Enjoy.

526
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Here.

527
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
It's delicious.

528
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,400
Look.

529
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
It's a red flower ball.

530
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Look at it.

531
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Try it.

532
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
It's delicious.

533
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
It's delicious.

534
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Good.

535
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Good.

536
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Mr. Ding,

537
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
22,000.

538
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,560
national writer of Didi,

539
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,800
This is for Teresa.

540
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,320
Hello.

541
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:27,480
I'm burger's

542
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,000
weather report from the money store.

543
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,000
It's Kan Youran's change.

544
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,000
This is what you beneficial to me?

545
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm Wei Jiu.

546
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,320
I've admired you for a long time.

547
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,880
How so?

548
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,760
You're young and you're already like a painting.

549
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,920
I heard that your new disciple, Su Yi Shui,

550
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
is only three years old.

551
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,320
He's already become a golden elixir.

552
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,440
I think he's going to have a chance to make a living.

553
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm willing to give up my position as the Young Master of the Chis.

554
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I'll change my position to the West Mountain.

555
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm sorry.

556
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
We're not going to be able to meet you.

557
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm afraid that you'll have to wait for a long time.

558
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I'll wait for you to come back.

559
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I'm sorry.

560
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Our Water Immortal is very talented.

561
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
She doesn't have any good skills.

562
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,000
I think that your talent is just so-so.

563
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,800
It's no use if you're going to the West Mountain.

564
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Forget it.

565
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
I heard that you like handsome disciples.

566
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Wei Jiu is not talented.

567
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
He's considered a handsome man.

568
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
He also learned a lot of skills.

569
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
If he's accepted,

570
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,400
the West Mountain will surely be a great place to visit.

571
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,600
Wei Jiu, right?

572
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,400
Not to mention the other things,

573
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
you're far worse than my disciple, Su Yi Shui,

574
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
in terms of beauty.

575
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Where can you find a talent like that?

576
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
Immortal Mu,

577
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
my reputation is known to the world.

578
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,400
How can Su Yi Shui be compared to me?

579
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
Immortal, are you trying to make trouble?

580
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Water Immortal, come here.

581
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Everyone, please give us your comments.

582
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
How does this one look?

583
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,400
Is it considered a sign?

584
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
It's not bad.

585
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Move over.

586
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
What about this one?

587
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
It's hard to compare.

588
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,200
This is the Immortal Zhe.

589
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
This friend of mine is considered a sign.

590
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,400
He's compared to this Immortal Zhe.

591
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
You guys say,

592
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,600
who's taller and who's shorter?

593
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
This is a special case.

594
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Look.

595
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,400
If you're not afraid of trouble,

596
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
you're afraid of being compared to others.

597
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Go back.

598
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Mu Qingge,

599
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,400
you'll regret it in the future.

600
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Remember this.

601
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Water,

602
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
you're really a good teacher.

603
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Here.

604
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
This is...

605
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
The most important thing to go down the mountain this time

606
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
is this.

607
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Take it.

608
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,800
Your present for the Golden Pellet City.

609
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Water,

610
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,600
have you been living well in the capital these days?

611
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Yes.

612
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,000
I've been living well.

613
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Interesting.

614
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,200
In this world,

615
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,800
there are always interesting places like this.

616
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,600
In the future, I will take you to every place

617
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,000
and play with you.

618
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,400
Take this sword

619
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
and follow me

620
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,600
to guard this interesting world.

621
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
The night falls, the snow falls,

622
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
the sky is empty.

623
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,200
The sky is blue, the clouds are blue,

624
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,400
the sky is blue, the clouds are blue.

625
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,400
Tears are like a dream,

626
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,000
this part

627
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,400
is so beautiful.

628
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,200
The moon in front of me,

629
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,800
I return to you,

630
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
my heart is still watered down.

631
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,600
The tears in front of me,

632
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
my heart is still unbending.

633
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,800
The moon in front of me,

634
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,600
I pass through the snow.

635
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,400
The fate is in my side,

636
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,800
the wind and the waves are still the same.

637
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,600
With you, I'm not afraid of

638
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,600
the world.

639
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,400
If I could only have one year of my life,

640
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,600
I would be with you forever.

641
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
I can't forget the day we met,

642
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,400
I hope we could turn back time.

643
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,200
Why is it that I can't forget our love?

644
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,600
I chase after the eternal night.

645
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,200
I only want to be with you,

646
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,000
day after day, year after year.

647
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,600
If I could only have one year of my life,

648
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,400
I would be with you forever.

649
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,600
I can't forget the day we met,

650
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,400
I hope we could turn back time.

651
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I once dreamed of the sword in my hand,

652
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,600
I was the one who shot through the sky.

653
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,000
I can't forget the day we met,

654
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,600
I once dreamed of the sword in my hand,

655
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,200
I once dreamed of the sword in my hand,

656
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,600
before we met.

657
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:22,800
I once dreamed of the sword in my hand,

658
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,620
The fragments of you heroically

659
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,700
happened in the past two weeks

660
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,960
But you are finally here

661
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,740
returned to your original Position

662
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,380
as your Dover

663
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,260
A laugh

664
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,320
especially

665
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,360
this moment

666
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,260
both parents

667
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,040
two them

668
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,740
Finishing

669
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,520
as me

670
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,000
So

671
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,280
it turns out
