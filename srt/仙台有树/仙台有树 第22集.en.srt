[Episode 22]

3
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,350
That's already going against fate.

4
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,710
If you wish to enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

5
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,440
and attain instant ascension,

6
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,280
you must bear the risks that come with it.

7
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Then my master...

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,290
That's your master, right?

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,110
It's indeed Master's technique.

10
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,470
Master did use the Soul Control Technique

11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,800
to reside in Bai's body.

12
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,840
That woman

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,260
should be too preoccupied to fight your master now.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,280
Girl,

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
you made it out of the Treasure Cave.

16
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,470
This is the final test of the trial.

17
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,079
Let's go.

18
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,910
That's…

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,750
Senior Lu Yun?

20
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,840
This cave is called the Memory Cave.

21
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,030
[The Memory Cave, Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

22
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,840
Those who pass the trial of Heavenly Meridian Mountain

23
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,680
will leave their obsessions

24
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
here.

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,890
I suppose this is the bit of amusement Dun Tian sought

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,130
in exchange for opening the Mountain.

27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,810
Dun Tian was so great. I thought he did this

28
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,800
to support the younger generations.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
If it were just about offering support,

30
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,770
throwing down some immortal herbs and pills

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
would be enough.

32
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,560
Just to see

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,020
other people's memories?

34
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,960
Wouldn't that be too boring?

35
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,840
But immortals live too long,

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
and the Immortal Realm is forever the same.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
After a while,

38
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,000
it all becomes unbearably dull.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
So I followed Dun Tian

40
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,590
to observe this once-in-nineteen-years trial

41
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,430
and watch them

42
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,810
leave behind

43
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,800
memories of joy or sorrow.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,780
Only then did I realize

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
that the mortal world

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
holds the most fascinating things.

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,310
So even those who have entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,370
are also like this.

49
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,400
It seems that every heart

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,800
carries its own desires.

51
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,680
♫In March, we make rice milk♫

Sit down.

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,960
Whose obsession is this?

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,090
Dun Tian's.

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,750
Dun Tian's obsession

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,650
was his wife and daughters?

71
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,240
Indeed.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,870
Chang'e must regret stealing the spiritual medicine,

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,870
gazing at the blue sky night after night with a heavy heart.

74
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,200
Did he regret it deeply?

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Back then, Dun Tian

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,140
glimpsed the secrets of fate.

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,920
He knew that to attain ascension,

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,820
he had to sever all worldly attachments,

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
slay the Mortal-Demon Lord,

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,890
and prove his worth for immortality.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,560
So,

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,830
in his final battle...

83
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,480
Dun Tian!

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,930
Save our children!

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,150
Dun Tian!

86
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,210
He didn't save

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,390
his wife, Rong Yao,

88
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,790
and their two daughters.

89
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,680
In the end,

90
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,070
he ascended to the Immortal Realm,

91
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,240
but his wife and daughters

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,830
suffered tragic deaths.

93
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,250
Of course, he regretted it.

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,409
The loss outweighed the gain.

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,120
A happy family

96
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,230
should've been what he pursued.

97
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,600
We only fight evil to protect

98
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
our family, don't we?

99
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,870
To attain the hollow ascension,

100
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,800
he cast away what was most precious

101
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,000
and then regretted it.

102
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,660
Wasn't it all for nothing

103
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,260
but self-inflicted misery?

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
It's all over now.

105
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,000
What's done is done.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Decades ago,

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,890
a dark force invaded the Celestial Palace

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,150
for the Heavenly Book.

109
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,950
Dun Tian fought fiercely against it

110
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,610
and unfortunately perished.

111
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,310
Now, in the whole universe,

112
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,410
only this Memory Cave

113
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
holds traces of him.

114
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,770
Take this spiritual light

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,430
and leave your obsession

116
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,680
here as well.

117
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,680
Then,

118
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,830
the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

119
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,870
will open for you.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
May I ask

121
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,570
where my master's obsession is?

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,430
I want to see it.

123
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,330
Your master entered the Black Pool back then.

124
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,020
His obsession is not here.

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
The Black Pool?

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Once you enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,130
you'll understand.

128
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,040
The Pool is divided into two: one white and one black.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
The White Pool

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,630
strengthens one's cultivation,

131
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,160
allowing for steady and righteous progress,

132
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,400
while the Black Pool

133
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,890
grants rapid advancement

134
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,820
at the cost of awakening one's inner demons.

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,830
Your master

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
chose the Black Pool.

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,630
So when Heavenly Meridian Mountain trembled,

138
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,240
his obsession

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,570
was lost to the unknown.

140
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,250
It's getting late.

141
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,490
I should head back.

142
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,720
Girl,

143
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,830
please

144
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,200
tell that drunkard brother of mine

145
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,040
to drink less.

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,280
After all,

147
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,670
he's my only family left.

148
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,890
I'll pass on your message.

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
So,

150
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,000
all my memories with Master…

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,200
have become my obsession.

152
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,550
I wonder what Master's obsession is.

153
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,130
Perhaps it's Grandmaster.

154
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,360
The Marrow-Cleansing Pool is just ahead.

155
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,270
Once I enter,

156
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,880
I'll form my Golden Core

157
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,200
and can leave Mount Wester.

158
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,130
I wonder if after that,

159
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,150
Master will

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,670
occasionally think of me.

161
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,150
Xue Ranran,

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,730
don't overthink it.

163
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,960
After completing your training,

164
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,030
go back and bid Master a proper farewell.

165
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,480
You can still visit him during holidays

166
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,790
to pay your respects.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
You'll surely see him again.

168
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,540
[Marrow-Cleansing Pool, Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,630
So this is the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

170
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,910
The Black Pool

171
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,880
truly holds immense spiritual power,

172
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,770
but it's also filled with a lot of resentment.

173
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,220
Any righteous cultivator

174
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
would surely choose the White Pool.

175
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,540
Why did Master choose the Black Pool?

176
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,690
Let go of the past.

177
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,630
Master is fine.

178
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,630
Now,

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,870
you should make your choice.

180
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,160
I've formed my Golden Core.

181
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,220
I'm a Golden Core cultivator now!

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,440
Master!

183
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,200
Mu Qingge!

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,030
Don't!

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,390
Did I just see…

186
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,720
Master?

187
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,130
Was that a memory from my past life

188
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,370
or from Ling Xiao's?

189
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
And why was Master in it?

190
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,840
My cultivation

191
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
has dropped to the early Golden Core stage.

192
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,930
She…

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,260
She entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool!

194
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,390
It's that demon, Gui Baqian?

195
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,120
I finally made it

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,600
to the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

197
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,270
but its power

198
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,840
has been mostly taken by you.

199
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,320
Girl,

200
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,600
do you have a death wish?

201
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,460
Stop right now!

202
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,510
I followed the rules of Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

203
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,120
You barged in using dark magic,

204
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,270
yet you're asking me to stop.

205
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,130
Sovereign Wei,

206
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,720
you're so brazen.

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
How did you figure it out?

208
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,360
When I met the blood-sucking vines,

209
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
I knew that Gui Baqian

210
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
was a demon.

211
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,480
Few demons

212
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,600
would dare sneak into

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

214
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
And even fewer

215
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,150
have lost their cultivation

216
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,950
and are desperate to recover it.

217
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,720
You meet all these criteria, Sovereign Wei.

218
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,050
It wasn't hard to guess.

219
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
I hoped to use the Pool

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,030
to reach the Transcendence Realm,

221
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,600
but the little power left has only

222
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,790
brought me back to the peak of the Nascent Soul Realm.

223
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,450
Xue Ranran,

224
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,870
I'll kill you right now

225
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,000
and take your power!

226
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,670
Let's see how long you can hold me off!

227
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,130
It doesn't need to be long.

228
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
The trial is over.

229
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,170
What's going on?

230
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,750
Why is everyone back?

231
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,630
Someone entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

232
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,630
The trial is over.

233
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,710
Who entered the Pool?

234
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,150
Ranran!

235
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,300
-Ranran!
-Ranran!

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,750
Ranran,

237
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,030
you really made it.

238
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
You have the spiritual mark on your forehead.

239
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
You really entered the Pool.

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
We'll talk about that later.

241
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,630
Be careful of Wei Jiu.

242
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,230
Wei Jiu?

243
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,200
Why is that demon Wei Jiu

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,390
here in Heavenly Meridian Mountain?

245
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,000
He has the Pool's

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,630
spiritual mark on his forehead too.

247
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,560
What's going on?

248
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,840
Wei Jiu used dark magic to disguise himself as Gui Baqian,

249
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,870
then forced his way into the Pool,

250
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,320
and took a part of its power.

251
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Guys, let's take him down together!

252
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,840
Pathetic fools.

253
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,730
Ranran.

254
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,030
You've formed your Golden Core.

255
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,830
That's great!

256
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,480
Mu Qingge,

257
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,720
don't just watch!

258
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Help me!

259
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,030
Demonic scum,

260
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,080
everyone wants to kill you.

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,350
Why should I help you?

262
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,750
Have you forgotten about the Resentment Liquid?

263
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,980
Let me remind you.

264
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,270
You've broken free of it?

265
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,960
Yeah.

266
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,480
Sovereign Wei, your chances of survival are slim.

267
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,540
If you want to live,

268
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,710
I'm afraid there's only one way:

269
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,720
beg me.

270
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,750
Dream on!

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,670
If you said that in your past life,

272
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,630
it'd make some sense.

273
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,670
But in this life?

274
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Why the hell should I beg you?

275
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,720
Master Mu,

276
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,240
how can you try to collude with this demon?

277
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,040
Forget it.

278
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,490
It was just for amusement anyway.

279
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
You've gained power from the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

280
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,660
Congratulations.

281
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,270
The Imperial Heaven-Reversing Seal!

282
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,680
It's an imperial artifact.

283
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,910
The Crown Prince actually

284
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,710
lent it to you.

285
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,900
Today, I'll use this artifact

286
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,630
to exact my revenge!

287
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,550
Mu Qingge!

288
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,080
What are you going to do?

289
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
You're all dead!

290
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,000
Why won't the Seal kill?

291
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
What went wrong?

292
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

293
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,240
The Heaven-Reversing Seal

294
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,360
has shattered the celestial rocks in Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

295
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,320
The last

296
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
of the Four-Way Waterways

297
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
has now been cleared.

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,480
Soon,

299
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,880
the waters will flow into the capital.

300
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,080
Clearing the waterway on the Heavenly Ones' sacred land

301
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
was no easy feat.

302
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,540
I must thank her for her help.

303
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,950
Master Mu, you must be mistaken.

304
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,720
Imperial artifacts

305
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,510
can only be activated by imperial blood.

306
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,390
Young Master Yu would never

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,990
let you use it to harm people.

308
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,730
You tried to kill us but only embarrassed yourself.

309
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,849
How amusing.

310
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,640
Your reputation among the Heavenly Ones

311
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,069
is as good as ruined.

312
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,380
But

313
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,310
I can offer you a way out.

314
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,829
Kill everyone here for me,

315
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,960
and I'll keep

316
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
your secret safe.

317
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,410
I prefer to solve this myself.

318
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,150
Watch out!

319
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,830
Devourer Bugs!

320
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,920
Mu Qingge, you're insane

321
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,780
for raising these cursed things!

322
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,740
Sovereign Wei,

323
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,680
you and everyone here

324
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
have to die today!

325
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,880
That's the safest way

326
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,960
to keep a secret!

327
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,850
Mu Qingge ran away?

328
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,240
Devourer Bugs feed on spiritual power.

329
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,640
Even ascended immortals

330
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,510
can't resist so many of them.

331
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,030
Let's run in different directions!

332
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,550
Take these Escape Talismans!

333
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,000
Once I distract the Devourer Bugs,

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
you'll activate them

335
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,240
and get down the mountain!

336
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,510
Distract the Devourer Bugs?

337
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,640
How will you escape?

338
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,000
I've formed my Golden Core.

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,790
I'll find a way.

340
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,270
Run!

341
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,650
We're not leaving!

342
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,400
Master?

343
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,740
Go!

344
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,650
It's really you!

345
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,440
Jump into the water!

346
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,770
[The foot of Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

347
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,830
The spiritual light in Heavenly Meridian Mountain just faded.

348
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,880
Someone has entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool?

349
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
Since the trial is over,

350
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,010
why hasn't anyone come out?

351
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,440
Help!

352
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,240
Master.

353
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,880
It's Wei Jiu.

354
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,960
Wei Jiu?

355
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,240
He's in Heavenly Meridian Mountain?

356
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,440
How is that possible?

357
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,140
Wei Jiu used dark magic

358
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,960
to disguise himself as Gui Baqian from Lingdi Sect.

359
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,420
He snuck into the mountain

360
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
and released Devourer Bugs.

361
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,580
Devourer Bugs?

362
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,940
That's…

363
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,020
Devourer Bugs? Devourer Bugs?

364
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,240
I did everything I could

365
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,370
to make it out alive.

366
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,120
I'm afraid the others...

367
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,200
What should we do?

368
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,370
How did Wei Jiu obtain those deadly bugs?

369
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,160
The barrier is still in place.

370
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,960
We can't get inside to save them.

371
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,620
W-What should we do?

372
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,700
[Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

373
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,640
Master,

374
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,760
are you alright?

375
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,440
Master,

376
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,150
the bugs I gave you,

377
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
are you satisfied with them?

378
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,070
They got in your way,

379
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,530
so just let those bugs

380
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,860
send them to hell.

381
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,830
Once everything's settled,

382
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,760
I'll escort you back to the palace.

383
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,400
Hurry!

384
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,830
The Devourer Bugs will

385
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,290
track our power here soon.

386
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,110
Master,

387
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,810
what is this place?

388
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
You've been here before?

389
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Su Yishui?

390
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,470
Soul Control Technique?

391
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,960
You actually resorted to such a method

392
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,090
to enter Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

393
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,490
Let's go.

394
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,710
I'm not finished yet!

395
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,070
No wonder you were able to enter the Pool.

396
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,730
So Su Yishui helped you cheat.

397
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,080
Does it hurt?

398
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,030
The Devourer Bugs drained quite a bit

399
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,830
of your power.

400
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,700
You're gravely injured.

401
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,070
So what?

402
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,310
Since we've all

403
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,750
lost a great deal of power,

404
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,960
why not call a temporary truce

405
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,910
to recover first

406
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,270
and find a way out?

407
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,680
Fine.

408
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,970
Break the binding spell first.

409
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,200
Sovereign Wei, your reputation is terrible.

410
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
How can I trust you so easily?

411
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,160
End of conversation.

412
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,310
Enjoy your solitude.

413
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,920
Farewell.

414
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,960
Wait.

415
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,310
A truce it is.

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm not afraid of you anyway.

417
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,310
You're so rough with an injured person!

418
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,590
Master,

419
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,550
the Devourer Bugs have damaged your meridians.

420
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,550
Take this Meridian Repairing Pill.

421
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,330
I'm injured too.

422
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
Feel free

423
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,840
to use these medicines.

424
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Don't treat me like a beggar.

425
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,930
You just said

426
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,110
the Devourer Bugs damaged the meridians.

427
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,880
What use are these external wound medicines?

428
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,590
There's only one Meridian Repairing Pill.

429
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,920
It has to go to my master.

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,260
You'll have to make do.

431
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,270
What's that?

432
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,640
Ranran,

433
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,920
give me the pill.

434
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Wei Jiu is cunning.

435
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,110
We can't let him live.

436
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,400
It's better to kill him now.

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Su Yishui,

438
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,270
you can't kill me!

439
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,490
You used the Soul Control Technique to possess the White Tiger

440
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,110
and fought Mu Qingge

441
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,270
and the Devourer Bugs.

442
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,310
You've been greatly weakened.

443
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,160
If you kill me now,

444
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,490
you…

445
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,390
you'll suffer severe injuries.

446
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,410
What are you doing?

447
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,480
Is it true?

448
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Has the Soul Control Technique

449
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,520
really weakened you so much?

450
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,640
Of course it's true.

451
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,610
Possessing a divine beast

452
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,400
drains one's spiritual soul

453
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
every time one practices magic.

454
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,920
If their spiritual soul is already incomplete,

455
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,830
it'll shorten their lifespan,

456
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,690
causing death!

457
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,180
Ranran,

458
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,910
your master must be severely injured.

459
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,840
Otherwise, he wouldn't have used illusions to hide…

460
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,870
You trust him?

461
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,030
I don't.

462
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,750
It's just that we agreed to a temporary truce.

463
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,950
I should keep my word.

464
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,920
Moreover,

465
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,840
your spiritual power

466
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,770
is indeed weaker than before.

467
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,750
Whether it's true or not,

468
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,450
I don't want you to get hurt.

469
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,590
If you insist,

470
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,520
I'll drop it.

471
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,650
But I'm truly fine.

472
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,400
I don't need the Meridian Repairing Pill.

473
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,830
You take it.

474
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,130
Half for each of us.

475
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,350
Meditate now.

476
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,550
Master.

477
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,290
I'll find a way to treat your injuries.

478
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,880
Eat something first.

479
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,550
With damaged meridians, fasting won't work.

480
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,010
You need to eat something.

481
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,260
The dried sweet potato is delicious.

482
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,000
I saw a lot of vegetation

483
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,330
outside the waterfall.

484
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
There might be medicinal herbs.

485
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,700
I'll go take a look.

486
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
If you behave

487
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,840
and don't wake my master up,

488
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,570
I'll share some with you later.

489
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,930
You won't take this chance to break free

490
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,530
and hurt my master, will you?

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,110
Still,

492
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
better safe than sorry.

493
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,260
Don't blame me.

494
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,790
See you in a bit.

495
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,480
Prajna Orchid Herb!

496
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
It's mine now!

497
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,030
So this place

498
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,640
is the Memory Cave for those who entered

499
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,500
the Black Pool.

500
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,800
Master entered the Black Pool,

501
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
so his obsession...

502
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,930
Where's Ranran?

503
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,310
She's your disciple.

504
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,510
Why are you asking me?

505
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,870
I'm asking you—where is Ranran?

506
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,080
She...

507
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,350
she said she went out to find herbs

508
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,680
to treat your injuries.

509
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,640
Ling Xiao,

510
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,360
you can break this seal?

511
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,350
The obsession on it

512
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,600
belongs to your soul owner?

513
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,880
I don't need a son.

514
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,830
I need someone valuable.

515
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,920
I…

516
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,720
I…

517
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,790
I'll definitely become

518
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,790
a person of value.

519
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,590
And you

520
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,170
are the one-in-a-million

521
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Demon's child.

522
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,220
I feel the Spirit Spring.

523
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,530
Why is it Master?

524
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,510
I saw it before.

525
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,810
Ling Xiao's soul owner is the Demon's child.

526
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,370
But Master is also the Demon's child.

527
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,260
Could it be that

528
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,640
the soul owner is Master?

529
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,990
Everything you saw is true.

530
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,480
It's me.

531
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,270
I'm the one who brought calamities to the world,

532
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,400
the one all Heavenly Ones want to kill.

533
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
Is this why

534
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,440
you want me to leave?

535
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,690
Exactly.

536
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,520
Now that you've seen the truth,

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,740
leave Mount Wester

538
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
after you go back.

539
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,570
Who cares about the Demon's child?

540
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,570
I've just found out—

541
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,070
♫Who is that alone under the tree?♫

542
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,110
the one I've been searching for

543
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,970
is you, Master;

544
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,110
the one who's protected me by my side since I was a child

545
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,000
is also you;

546
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,340
♫Stained with a light and clear glow♫

547
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,350
in that icy spiritual sense,

548
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,200
the one who quietly listened to me

549
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,070
was still you.

550
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,210
♫Repeatedly awakened from dreams by the shattered shadow of the moon♫

551
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,520
In this world,

552
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,590
only you truly care about me.

553
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,470
♫Outside the mountain, longing reflected in the limpid eyes♫

554
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,590
I don't care if you're the Demon's child.

555
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,520
All I know is that

556
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,560
you're the one

557
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,280
who treats me the best in this world.

558
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,960
♫With a gentle nudge of the night breeze, the lantern is empty♫

559
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,810
♫Time passed can never be brought back♫

560
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,600
♫On sleepless nights, I toast to the world and drown my sorrows♫

561
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,020
It's all just a twist of fate.

562
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,360
Even if I care for you,

563
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,090
♫My lovesickness comprises only of you♫

564
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,320
it's for the sake of that old friend of mine.

565
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,440
I've spent so long with you in Mount Wester.

566
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,110
I know you better

567
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,070
than you think.

568
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,170
♫If the long night is too dark, I'll keep you company all the way♫

569
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,550
When you have something weighing on you,

570
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,210
you say things you don't mean.

571
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,400
I won't believe

572
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,290
♫To face all the love and hatred, the rights and wrongs♫

573
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,960
a single word you say.

574
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,580
Don't even think about pushing me away again.

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,540
♫Our tortuous fate alternating endlessly between partings and reunions, joy and sorrow♫

576
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,070
Master,

577
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,120
you've never abandoned me,

578
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,440
and I'll never abandon you either.

579
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,850
♫Only after experiencing death and rebirth do you realize its preciousness♫

580
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,310
Why is Master so badly injured?

581
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:05,610
♫A destiny full of twists and turns, a love fraught with hardship♫

582
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,160
Illusions…

583
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,530
Master used illusions to hide his injuries.

584
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,920
♫But I remain fearless with no regrets♫

585
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,000
Master,

586
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,680
let me heal your wounds.

587
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:17,120
♫Waiting for the fallen flowers to dance and silhouettes to pair up♫

588
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,750
♫Eventually nestling in each other's arms again♫

589
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Master,

590
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,830
have a rest in the Qiankun Pouch.

591
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
There's one left.

592
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,550
Something feels off.

593
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,840
Look around.

594
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,440
There's not a single plant here.

595
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,570
What's going on?

596
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,050
It's the Devourer Bugs.

597
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,350
Trapped in Heavenly Meridian Mountain

598
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,550
with no power as food,

599
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,820
they must be gnawing away at the mountain veins.

600
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,950
That's horrifying.

601
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,600
Those bugs

602
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,830
were once a calamity in the Immortal Realm.

603
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,590
It took everything the Immortal Realm had

604
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,520
to wipe them out.

605
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,630
Where did Master Mu get them?

606
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,750
She couldn't have raised them herself.

607
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,740
Devourer Bugs need to feed on

608
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,160
corpses and blood for decades

609
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
just to hatch.

610
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,250
Mu Qingge was reborn less than two years ago.

611
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,640
There's no way she could've raised them.

612
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,110
What will happen if the mountain veins here

613
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,440
are completely severed

614
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,050
by those Devourer Bugs?

615
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
Heavenly Meridian Mountain will collapse.

616
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,970
We'll all be buried alive here.

617
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Let's find a way to escape together.

618
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,960
Aren't you afraid I'll hurt you?

619
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,370
If a man of your stature

620
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,440
were to break his word at a time like this

621
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,700
just to fight a junior,

622
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,350
he'd be unworthy of his reputation.

623
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,920
What are you doing?

624
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Let's go.

625
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,590
That Vermilion Bird is suppressed by Heavenly Meridian Mountain

626
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,920
and can't use its power.

627
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,100
It's injured now.

628
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,370
I have to save it.

629
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,240
At a time like this,

630
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,400
you're worried about a bird?

631
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,310
If the Devourer Bugs find us,

632
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,110
we're doomed!

633
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,960
We're almost there.

634
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
The mountain gate

635
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,470
is just beyond this pass.

636
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,960
What are you doing now?

637
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,550
Let's go!

638
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,270
We can't just leave like this.

639
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,110
After the Devourer Bugs sever the mountain veins,

640
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,200
they'll fly out and wreak havoc in the mortal world.

641
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,590
By then, even though the mortal world is vast,

642
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,520
there will be nowhere left to hide.

643
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,400
Then let's hide while we can.

644
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,860
Living one more day is better than dying now.

645
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,480
The mountain veins are about to break.

646
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,350
Spiritual energy is leaking.

647
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,940
I'll use it to kill the Devourer Bugs.

648
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,870
You leave first.

649
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,150
You're crazy!

650
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,239
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

651
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,190
The mountain veins are severed.

652
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,550
The restrictions are gone.

653
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,210
Vermilion Bird, you can show your true form now!

654
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,630
Why is the Mountain completely drained of spiritual energy

655
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,630
and its mountain veins all severed?

656
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,409
The barrier is open.

657
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,909
Let's go in and save them!

658
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,449
Let's go!

659
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It must be Wei Jiu.

660
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,630
What a tragedy.

661
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,070
The disciples in there for training

662
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,730
were all killed by that demon.

663
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,640
You're still alive?

664
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,710
You actually believe

665
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,770
this woman's lies?

666
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,710
She was the one who released the Devourer Bugs!

667
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,170
Wei Jiu,

668
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,190
don't pin the blame on someone else!

669
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,960
Idiot!

670
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,290
I snuck in

671
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,920
for the power of the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

672
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,710
Why would I destroy the Mountain?

673
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,310
So many disciples have died,

674
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
and you're still lying here.

675
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,710
Everyone,

676
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,420
let's kill this demon together!

677
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,020
Let's avenge our disciples!

678
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,130
Wei Jiu isn't lying.

679
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,350
The havoc today

680
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,130
was all Master Mu's doing.

681
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,360
I thought

682
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,770
you were just selfish.

683
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,810
I never imagined

684
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,710
you could be so malicious.

685
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,280
Xue Ranran,

686
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
why are you speaking such nonsense?

687
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
Wei Jiu

688
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,070
even managed to get into the Mountain.

689
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,870
He's really great at dark magic.

690
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,960
Xue Ranran must have

691
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,690
fallen under his spell as well.

692
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,000
But what Xue Ranran just put in her bag

693
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,730
was the Vermilion Bird, right?

694
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,800
With that divine bird with her,

695
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,540
she couldn't possibly be under any evil spell.

696
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,090
I'm so glad you're all safe.

697
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,320
Master Mu

698
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,250
released swarms of Devourer Bugs.

699
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,780
We thought we were doomed.

700
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,960
Luckily, you gave us plenty of talismans.

701
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,490
We hid in the water all night

702
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,110
and barely escaped with our lives.

703
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,760
If not for Master Wen arriving in time,

704
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,240
we wouldn't have survived.

705
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,880
You didn't expect

706
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,410
so many survivors, did you?

707
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,210
You're a habitual liar.

708
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,980
Are you still going to deny it?

709
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,590
Yes,

710
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,440
it was me.

711
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,400
But do you think

712
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,730
I wanted this to happen?

713
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,880
Look at

714
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Xue Ranran and Wei Jiu's foreheads.

715
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,340
What do you see?

716
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,280
The spiritual mark of the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

717
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
They both have it.

718
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,010
The Pool has always

719
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,230
allowed only one person to enter.

720
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,660
But why did both Xue Ranran

721
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,360
and Wei Jiu enter it?

722
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,860
The Vermilion Bird

723
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,140
was sealed by Dun Tian.

724
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,110
Why did it follow Xue Ranran

725
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,090
after the Mountain collapsed?

726
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,840
It's because

727
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
Xue Ranran and Wei Jiu have been conspiring

728
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,800
from the start!

729
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,600
Everyone, look.

730
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,920
They used Resentment Liquid early on

731
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,720
to control me.

732
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,560
They forced me to obtain Devourer Bugs.

733
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,270
Otherwise, how could I have such things

734
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,680
so soon after my rebirth?

735
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,030
This is all their

736
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,310
elaborate scheme to deceive everyone.

737
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,580
And now, they're trying to pin everything on me!

738
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,710
Xue Ranran wouldn't do that!

739
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,330
As for Ranran's identity,

740
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,490
I hope that no matter when or what,

741
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,400
you won't mention it to others.

742
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,460
I have my own plans.

743
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,280
I've said

744
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,860
all there is to say.

745
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,880
If you still don't believe me,

746
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,000
then take my life.

747
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,920
This is complex. It's hard to distinguish truth from lies.

748
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,580
Let's put Xue Ranran, Wei Jiu,

749
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,730
and Mu Qingge

750
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,870
into the Bone-Scraping Tower

751
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,320
for interrogation.

752
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,790
Have you all gone mad?

753
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,390
Based on a few words from this vicious woman,

754
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,000
you're going to make Xue Ranran and me

755
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,060
suffer the agony of shattered bones and burning souls?

756
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,960
Everyone,

757
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,280
if we judge others recklessly,

758
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,920
how can we call ourselves righteous?

759
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,520
Elder Wen,

760
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,040
letting villains roam free

761
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,000
is even less righteous.

762
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,280
They just need

763
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,150
to suffer a bit to prove their innocence.

764
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,150
The truth will come out eventually.

765
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,760
No!

766
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,190
Elder Wen,

767
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,040
don't worry about me.

768
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,940
We won't accept this treatment without a fight.

769
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,640
Fine.

770
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,680
I'll just need to kill a few more people.

771
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,500
You think you can take me down?

772
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,510
Wei Jiu,

773
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,290
do you really think

774
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
we wouldn't take precautions for guarding

775
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,060
the sacred Heavenly Meridian Mountain?

776
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,240
Activate the formation!

777
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:50,970
Everyone!

778
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,030
The Annihilation Sword Formation!

779
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,190
How dare you mess with the Westers!

780
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,450
You must have a death wish!

781
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,160
Master!

782
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,290
Su Yishui!

783
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,190
Su Yishui?

784
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,710
Blame everything that happened today on me.

785
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,160
Mount Wester is right here.

786
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,010
Come anytime.

787
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll be waiting.

788
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,710
Su Yishui

789
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,110
is so powerful,

790
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,510
suppressing the formation from thousands of miles away.

791
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,040
How much spiritual power must that have cost?

792
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,630
The Westers are all gone.

793
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,820
Wei Jiu also escaped in the chaos.

794
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,200
Where's Mu Qingge?

795
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,090
Of course, she escaped with them.

796
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,360
I made all these arrangements

797
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,890
just to push you

798
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,150
to this point.

799
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Your Ice Lotus Technique

800
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,840
must have failed, right?

801
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,670
The day of success

802
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,440
is even closer now!

803
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,320
Master is so powerful.

804
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,580
I wonder how he managed

805
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,190
to suppress

806
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,120
that terrifying sword formation.

807
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,630
Ranran,

808
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,230
the spiritual mark on your forehead

809
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,410
vanished as soon as we left Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

810
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,350
I'll continue my seclusion.

811
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,080
I'm leaving.

812
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,630
Ranran!

813
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,280
Master!

814
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,630
I, Su Yishui, sovereign of Wester Sect,

815
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,940
lift the restrictions on Xue Ranran,

816
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,510
allow her to complete her training,

817
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,840
and leave Mount Wester.

818
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,070
From today on,

819
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,760
in this vast world,

820
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,700
she may come and go as she pleases.

821
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,410
Master, you still want me to leave?

822
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
The time has come.

823
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,770
No matter what happens,

824
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,590
I only want

825
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,960
to stay by your side.

826
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,210
Mount Wester is not a place where you can do

827
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,360
whatever you want.

828
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,110
Master…

829
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,510
Leave now.

830
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,630
Master!

831
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,000
Ranran!

832
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,230
Mr. Zeng,

833
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,400
save Master!

834
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
Please, save Master!

835
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,550
He had split off a part of his soul to protect me,

836
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,210
and just now he used the Soul Control Technique.

837
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,550
Oh no.

838
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,530
His condition is worse than I thought.

839
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,360
The Ice Lotus in his body

840
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,890
has completely shattered.

841
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,760
The Ice Lotus?

842
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,280
He sacrificed half of his Golden Core

843
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,010
to nourish the Reincarnation Tree.

844
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,360
So he had to practice the Ice Lotus Technique

845
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,820
to repair his Golden Core.

846
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:17,760
Now,

847
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,670
with the Ice Lotus broken,

848
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,920
that half of the Golden Core has also shattered.

849
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,280
So he has fallen from the Transcendence Stage,

850
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,360
and his power is unstable now.
