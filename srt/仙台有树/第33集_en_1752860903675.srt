1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
aroma

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel a few times

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel between the north and the west.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I will give you a hundred years of my life.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am destined to be with you.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
But I still fear nothing and will not regret it.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love and hate of the world

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Episode 16

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
It's for you, Master.

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Look at this angry little person.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Do you think you are the master?

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,400
If you want to be angry again,

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
you can be my wife.

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I will be your wife.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,400
I will be your wife.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I will be your wife.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,600
I will be your wife.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I will be your wife.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
If you want to be angry again,

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
you can pinch her.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Childish.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Who would like this?

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Xue Ran Ran,

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
you'd better make me fall in love with you.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
Or I will take your golden elixir.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
You are just like the murderer in the book.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,800
Master, wait for me.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Hurry up.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,400
Master.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Ran Ran, you are back.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,400
From now on,

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,200
I will give you the daily meal in Xishan.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
That's great.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,400
I know you love Ran Ran the most.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Master,

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Master,

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
the new disciples you asked for

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,260
have finished the

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Master,

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
since you are willing to accept the disciple,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
why don't you call them back?

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
They have been waiting for orders in the mountains.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
They are so stupid.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
What's the use of keeping them?

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
I want disciples with good skills.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Then,

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
there are many disciples in Xishan.

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
There must be a lot of troublesome things.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
Xishan is big.

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
Master Chen and Master Tong are busy.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Xi Er and the other disciples

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
can help a lot.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you don't talk,

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
I will take it as a yes.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Thank you, Master.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Who is it?

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
How dare you break into the Xuanlian Sect?

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
It's the two of you from Jiuhua Sect and Kongshan Sect.

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,800
You came to my Chiyan Mountain late at night.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
I don't know what's going on.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Who is not well?

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Tell him to come out.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Master is in seclusion.

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
If you have anything,

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
just tell me.

68
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
The demon beast and demon painting trend that has recently appeared

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
is done by you.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Demon beast and demon painting?

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
We haven't had time to do such a boring thing.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Now that the Xuan Tian Sect has reopened,

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
the power of the demon cultivation is not enough.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are also many secret methods of demon cultivation.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Demon beast and demon painting.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
What's the use of us?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
I don't care what you righteous people think of us.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
But the demon cultivation

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
is different from your disciples

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,200
who are from the Xuan Sect.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
If they live in this world,

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
what is the reason for the demon cultivation to disappear?

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Okay.

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
I believe you.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But the demon beast and demon painting trend is not a small matter.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
You demon cultivation

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
always have more research on the things of the demon painting.

88
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
If you really have nothing to do with the recent events,

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
is there a way

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
to help us investigate this matter?

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Okay.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,200
I will pass on the order

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
to tell the disciples to be vigilant about the demon beast and demon painting.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
If we find any news,

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
we will definitely pass on the message to you.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
Then let's cooperate with you.

97
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Zicheng.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Master Tu.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
You have already been hiding behind my back

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
while I was hiding behind the wall.

102
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
You have already been hiding behind my back

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
while I was hiding behind the wall.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
I was supposed to make an agreement with the Xuan Sect.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
I am just doing my job.

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Why should I explain to the Xuan Sect?

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
You are such a jerk.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I know my mistake.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
I am just being myself.

110
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
I am willing to be punished

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
and expel the Xuan Tian Sect.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Your Majesty, you only have to announce to the Xuan Sect

113
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
that the Xuan Tian Sect does not have Tu Jiuyuan.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,800
I will not follow the agreement I have made.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You...

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You may all leave.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Tu Jiuyuan, what's wrong with you?

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,000
I just said a few words to you.

120
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
You just left after saying a few words?

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Actually...

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Actually, the situation is not that serious.

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
I have a lot of people.

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
But for the sake of following you for so many years,

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
I will not pursue this matter anymore.

126
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Why don't you thank me?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
I promised the old sect leader

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
to assist you.

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,000
I saw that you have re-opened the Xuan Tian Sect and achieved your dream.

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
My promise has also been fulfilled.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Now, I only want to be free.

132
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Leave this place that has been bothering me for half my life.

133
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Freedom.

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
I will live freely.

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
You, stop right there!

136
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Why is your injury still not healed?

137
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,600
It's just a small injury.

138
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
I don't need to worry about it.

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Your injury is not healed yet. Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
You...

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Are you...

142
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,000
so determined to leave because you love me and hate me?

143
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Actually, that day, in the You Realm...

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
If I let him know, I would go back to him.

145
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Wouldn't it make me look so shameless?

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Forget it.

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Look at your injury.

148
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
For so many years, your cultivation is still so bad.

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I...

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
I will allow you to re-opening the sect with me in the future

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
and share your spiritual power.

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
I will do it.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Are you satisfied now?

154
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
You misunderstood me.

155
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
I have already let go of my love.

156
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
I have no more hate left.

157
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,400
I just want to change my lifestyle.

158
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Take care of yourself in the future.

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Stop right there!

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Who said that you have already fulfilled your promise to that old ghost?

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,000
My ambition is to restore the Demon Realm.

162
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
I am just starting the Xuan Tian Sect.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
If you want to leave,

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,400
you must help me to break the Five Fiends Maze at the top of Mount Chi Yan

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,200
and let me go to the hidden side of Mount Chi Yan

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
and get the legendary Golden Fire.

167
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
The Golden Fire?

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
That's right.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
The Demon Realm is afraid of the Golden Fire.

170
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
As long as I can get the Golden Fire,

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,600
I can control and control those demon beasts that are being demonized

172
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
and make them sink into the water and be used by me.

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
By then, all the sects in the world

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
will have to bow to me

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and use me, the Xuan Tian Sect, as their first leader.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
By then, you will be able to take the Golden Fire

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
and by then, your promise will be fulfilled.

178
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I will let you go.

179
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,400
But if you can't break the Five Fiends Maze

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
and can't get the Golden Fire,

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
you can just stay here.

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Ran Ran.

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yu Tong said...

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
How are they doing with their cleaning?

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
They went to pay their respects to their master.

186
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
But their master felt troubled.

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
He kept quiet inside the house and didn't let them in.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They are now cleaning the house.

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
That's good.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
That's Xue Ran Ran.

191
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
She's the one who got the first place in the water

192
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
and got the Holy Heir's Spirit.

193
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,600
I'll make a good meal for everyone today

194
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
to celebrate.

195
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I'll get going.

196
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Usually, at this hour,

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
she would have come to send me tea.

198
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
What's going on today?

199
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Xue Ran Ran.

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Xue Ran Ran.

201
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,000
Why is she still not here?

202
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
How can there be a girl like her in this world?

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
She's been in the rain for three days and in the sun for two days.

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
She's never going in.

205
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Senior, hello.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm Yue Sheng, a new disciple.

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Please take care of me.

208
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Hello, Yue Sheng.

209
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll do the cleaning.

210
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,400
No need to trouble yourself.

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,400
I like to clean.

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Senior, let her do this.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm done.

214
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay, thank you.

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

216
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Senior, I'll help you with the other things.

217
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
No need.

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,400
Senior, I'm Shen Guo.

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll do the cutting work.

220
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Thank you.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
You're welcome.

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Senior, I'll help you.

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Hurry up.

224
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
You're pretty good.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've learned a little bit of the other skills before.

226
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
This time, I'm going to West Mountain

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
mainly to admire Senior.

228
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't listen to her nonsense, Senior.

229
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
She's done.

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
I heard that Senior is good at the Lian Dan Palace.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Can I learn from you in the future?

232
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Okay, I'll teach you another day.

233
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,000
You have a promise.

234
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I want to learn, Senior.

235
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
You can't learn.

236
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Master.

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Master.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Master.

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Master.

240
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
It's so lively.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
If you have free time to chat and laugh here,

242
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
then go to West Mountain Valley

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and pray for ten hours.

244
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Yes.

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

246
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Master.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Wait.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No one is allowed to come near the kitchen again.

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Yes.

250
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Master.

251
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Master, I'm here to bring you lunch.

252
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Master.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Master.

254
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,600
Teach me how to play with your junior Lian Dan

255
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
and West Mountain Pill.

256
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm not good at it.

257
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm not good at it.

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm not good at it.

259
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm not good at it.

260
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
After playing with them,

261
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
I've remembered your master.

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Master.

263
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,000
You're not jealous, are you?

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Jealous?

265
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm just trying to get married.

266
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
I have to cooperate with you.

267
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
How can I be jealous?

268
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Then, what's your master?

269
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I just didn't expect

270
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Mu Qingge's stupid sister

271
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
is just like her.

272
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
She's a bitch.

273
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
She's always trying to kill herself.

274
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm stupid?

275
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I, Mu Qingge, am stupid.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,200
How can you say that to me?

277
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,400
Yes.

278
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
You're right.

279
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,400
I like a handsome and elegant man.

280
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
But

281
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
I already have someone I like.

282
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll do it wholeheartedly.

283
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Because no one is more beautiful than him.

284
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
It's worth liking.

285
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Xue Ranran.

286
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
Don't just talk.

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,200
With your skills,

288
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
when will you stop cursing me?

289
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Since you say so,

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,400
I have to improve.

291
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Will I be scared?

292
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
You said I was jealous.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think I need to verify it.

294
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Did you verify it?

295
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Wait.

296
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Why are you so shy after kissing me?

297
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Have you kissed someone before?

298
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Yes.

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
I kissed a pig before.

300
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
It's a pig.

301
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
How dare you!

302
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm not angry yet.

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
I'm just a little bit nervous.

304
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm not angry.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm just a little bit nervous.

306
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
I'm just a little bit nervous.

307
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
How dare you!

308
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm not angry yet.

309
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
He's wronged.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Luckily, he's back to life.

311
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Otherwise, if I let him go,

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll hurt those young people who are not at peace.

313
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
A pig with a clear conscience.

314
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
What?

315
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
A pig?

316
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Could it be...

317
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
You...

318
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Elder Su, you've tried many times.

319
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
You can't try again.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Elder Su!

321
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Where are you in the Fiery Fist?

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
With your special skills,

324
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
you can't even pass the barrier.

325
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
How can you enter the town?

326
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Don't waste your energy.

327
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Go back and stay.

328
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
I can't pass it now,

329
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
but since I've promised you,

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
I'll definitely find a way to do it.

331
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,000
Please show me your mercy.

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Luckily, the Fiery Fist

333
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
can still pass the barrier.

334
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
Otherwise, once I really get into the town,

335
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
it'll be very dangerous.

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But I've tried it several times.

337
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
The barrier can't pass.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
I should think of another way.

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
He was the one who passed it first,

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but he made me copy the disciple's door.

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm the most stubborn one.

342
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Again?

343
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
Ye Xin said that my cultivation method

344
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
has worked.

345
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Let me try it.

346
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Can I use this to change the Soul-guarding Spell

347
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,600
to take back the spiritual energy of Xue Ran Ran?

348
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
The spiritual energy is gone, Hai Xin.

349
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Ye Xin, you can't do this.

350
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'll do it.

351
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
The spiritual energy is gone, Hai Xin.

352
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm going to die.

353
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Go and get me some iron.

354
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Yes.

355
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Luckily, I ate the Moon Pellet earlier.

356
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Ran Ran.

357
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,800
What's wrong?

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Why do you look pale?

359
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,200
But because the owner...

360
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
Master gave it to me.

361
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
Did he order the dishes?

362
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,400
The owner said that you should cook it and send it to him in person.

363
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
See if you're right or wrong.

364
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
You're stubborn again.

365
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm not.

366
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I'm not.

367
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm not.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
You're stubborn again.

369
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
He wants to see me.

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,800
He won't come to see me by himself.

371
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Master Yu Tong, please tell him

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that I'm tired of him

373
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,400
and can't cook.

374
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
He can just eat a little.

375
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,800
As for me,

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
I still don't think I'm wrong.

377
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
I won't go and get angry with him.

378
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,600
That's right. Don't blame him.

379
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
By the way, Master Yu Tong,

380
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
I'd like to ask you to

381
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
go to the capital to investigate something.

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
The owner has sent Yu Chen to the capital.

383
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I wonder if it's the same thing as what you want to investigate.

384
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Master is also investigating Ye Xin's whereabouts.

385
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
In that case,

386
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
if there's any news about Master Yu Chen,

387
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
please let me know.

388
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,600
He said that?

389
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
I think Ran Ran looks pale.

390
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
She didn't eat dinner.

391
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
She came back with the owner.

392
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
She didn't have a good rest.

393
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,200
She was hurt by the accident.

394
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
How can someone be better than my master

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
in money and in everything?

396
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
Master is elegant and pure.

397
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
He's like a turtle.

398
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Just like this ice lotus.

399
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
It looks a little cold.

400
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
After tasting it,

401
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
it's a new product.

402
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
It's clearly a kind of...

403
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Master, is that you?

404
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Who do you think it is?

405
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
This Ling Chi

406
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,800
is the way I came back from the book store.

407
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you staying here

408
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
to awaken my memory?

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Your trick

411
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
seems to be a little bit dull.

412
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
What are you expecting?

413
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,800
I miss you.

414
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
And you forgot

415
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
that you taught me martial arts

416
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,400
in this Ling Chi.

417
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Why is your pulse so slow?

418
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,600
Did you get a bad luck in your practice?

419
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
These days,

420
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,200
you've been bothered by the Soul-disposing Bracelet.

421
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,600
Why didn't you tell me?

422
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
You're worried about me?

423
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm just worried about my golden elixir

424
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
and my memory.

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Since your Liao Bo Shou

426
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
is not working,

427
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,600
maybe you can try to get deeper.

428
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
How to get deeper?

429
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
I mean

430
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
you can learn to be more friendly

431
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
or more dependent on me.

432
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
What do you think it is?

433
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
You used to be like this, too.

434
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
You taught me how to call for help.

435
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
You taught me how to call for help.

436
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,600
Miss Xue, you're here.

437
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,200
Breakfast is ready.

438
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Here.

439
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Why did you make this for me?

440
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
It's the master's order.

441
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
He said you only need to sit in the closed room.

442
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
You don't need to prepare meals for him.

443
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,800
He wants to close the door, but he...

444
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
No, it's just an excuse.

445
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
Although the master didn't say it,

446
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,600
I think

447
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,200
he's afraid that you're too tired.

448
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
He even set a ban around Ling Chi.

449
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Other than you,

450
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
no one else can come near.

451
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
So you have to go to Naling to get some air these days.

452
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Junior,

453
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
please move a seat

454
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
and let's have a meal.

455
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
We're out of time.

456
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,000
What's the rush?

457
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,000
Find another seat.

458
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Junior,

459
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
this is my seat.

460
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,000
I saw you on the table.

461
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Did you see it?

462
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
We didn't see it.

463
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,600
We didn't see it.

464
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
I didn't see it either.

465
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
But if senior wants to come over to gather,

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,800
she can't.

467
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,400
Forget it.

468
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I don't want to see her.

469
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
You just hit my dad.

470
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
Let go of me.

471
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
Let go of me.

472
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Let go of me.

473
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Who are you after?

474
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,000
You're not the only one who can be the master in Xishan.

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,800
You...

476
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,600
According to the rules of Xishan,

477
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
no junior has ever bullied senior

478
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
by using his own skills.

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
He's just a boxer.

480
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
But he's even using his spiritual power to attack.

481
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Are you going to kill him?

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
If you guys are like this,

483
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,600
you'll be able to defeat the enemy

484
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
when you grow up.

485
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If I make a mistake, I'll be punished.

486
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
Why do you care about me?

487
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Let go of me.

488
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,600
You think I'm more capable than you?

489
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
You learned this from him?

490
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,600
What? You're still not convinced?

491
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Who told you I'm more capable than you?

492
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
Master.

493
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
What? Who did I learn from?

494
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
The hall is noisy.

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
No one is allowed to eat.

496
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Only those who are in the mountain can rest here.

497
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Yes, Master.

498
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Wait.

499
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,600
Didn't you hear what I said?

500
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
You hit me 50 times without asking me the reason.

501
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
I didn't make a mistake.

502
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Neither did Senior Brother and Senior Sister.

503
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Why should I be punished?

504
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
If you didn't make a mistake,

505
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
then whose fault is it?

506
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't respect you.

507
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I don't respect you.

508
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
It's your fault to fight with your fellow disciples.

509
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Say that again.

510
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,600
Master used his chance to take them to Mount Xi.

511
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,000
You were also a talented and clear-minded person.

512
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Master has forgotten about it.

513
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
But they are still your disciples.

514
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I've left them in Mount Xi.

515
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Xue Ran Ran.

516
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Don't think that I'll allow you to complete the task of finding my memories.

517
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
You can do whatever you want.

518
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,400
You take this as a task.

519
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
But these are all my true feelings.

520
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
You treat them as irrelevant people.

521
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
But they are all your disciples.

522
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Your negligence

523
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,200
has caused these new disciples to be indifferent to them.

524
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,800
They have no respect for you.

525
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You forgot that they once respected you and respected you.

526
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
They finally lost their way.

527
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
You forgot that they once fought with you.

528
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,600
They never retreated from the demon.

529
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Even if they face the danger of being surrounded by the Xuan Gate,

530
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
they still can't leave.

531
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
These things that you forgot

532
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
have happened before.

533
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,600
This love of a disciple

534
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
can't be killed by me.

535
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm sorry.

536
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
For today,

537
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm the one who caused the trouble.

538
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm the one who is against Master.

539
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

540
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,600
I'll take the responsibility for my own mistakes.

541
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Oh no.

542
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
I didn't bring the Yun Ling Pill.

543
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ran Ran.

544
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,400
It's the Soul Lock.

545
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
It's the Soul Lock.

546
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
It's the Soul Lock.

547
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Should be that person's engine.

548
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
If I kill you,

549
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
who would do legal service now?

550
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I think this person can become our target.

551
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
If she killed Brother Qian è?

552
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Even if you have me in your body,

553
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,100
it's not like I don't use my power,

554
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
but you still keep on taking advantage of my spiritual power.

555
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
It's done.

556
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I can see your spiritual power now.

557
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
In that case,

558
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
no matter where you go in the future,

559
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,600
remember to stay by my side.

560
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
You can use my spiritual power as you like.

561
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I'll go.

562
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Master used to give me the power of the Chang Du spirit.

563
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
This is how I practice the power of the spirit.

564
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
This is how I feel when I'm injured.

565
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Later on,

566
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Master connected the power of the spirit directly to me,

567
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,600
so that I could use your spiritual power anytime.

568
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
It's not that I forcefully take it in,

569
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
it's just that I'm used to it.

570
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Am I crazy?

571
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,600
That's why I used my power of the spirit to give you this power.

572
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
No wonder you've been in seclusion for 18 years,

573
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
and you're still so quiet.

574
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,600
What kind of curse did you cast on me?

575
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I was taught by Master.

576
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
If I cast a curse,

577
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,600
how could Master not know it?

578
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Master truly loves me and protects me.

579
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
He treats me well.

580
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Master, I was wrong.

581
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I shouldn't have been against you.

582
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
I should have talked to you nicely.

583
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Actually, Master hasn't changed.

584
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
He's always soft-hearted.

585
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
It was my first time to save my parents.

586
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
What a surprise.

587
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
You actually admitted your mistake.

588
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,600
You really know some tricks to seduce people.

589
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
This soul-locking lock is really troublesome.

590
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Before I can completely solve it,

591
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
you come here every day when you're married.

592
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I'll give you the power of the spirit to replenish your energy.

593
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
As for your room today,

594
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I'll give you the power of the spirit to replenish your energy.

595
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll give you the power of the spirit to replenish your energy.

596
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
As for your room today,

597
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I'll give you the power of the spirit to replenish your energy.

598
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Forget it.

599
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
You're so hardworking.

600
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You're not using my power.

601
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
What's the difference between punishing yourself and me?

602
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
You have the skill.

603
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Why don't you read more ancient books

604
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
and find out why the Heavenly Tree is punished by the Demon of Heaven?

605
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I won't punish you.

606
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
You're right.

607
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Thank you for your concern and advice.

608
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
You're so nice.

609
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Master, you're not good at saying words,

610
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
but you're kind-hearted.

611
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
You often give orders to the people of the mountain.

612
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Me?

613
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Kind-hearted?

614
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Master is good at everything.

615
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm not good at cooking.

616
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
The moon cake I baked

617
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
is very delicious.

618
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I'm not good at cooking.

619
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm not good at cooking.

620
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm not good at cooking.

621
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm not good at cooking.

622
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm not good at cooking.

623
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
The moon cake I baked is very delicious.

624
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Why did I bake moon cake for him

625
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
and not for me?

626
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
If you're embarrassed,

627
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
you'll be embarrassed and ignore others.

628
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
If you say a joke to tease him,

629
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
he'll be embarrassed.

630
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
And his eyebrows are more curved than usual.

631
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Nonsense.

632
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Your eyes are so dry

633
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
and not fit for me.

634
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
But I don't hate you.

635
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
You said,

636
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
everything in the past is just a mark left by the past.

637
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Like you said,

638
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
the magic of the demon is not about good or evil.

639
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
The magic is just magic.

640
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
The demon is the deity.

641
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
It's up to you.

642
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
The demon is the deity.

643
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
It's up to you.

644
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
The demon is the deity.

645
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
It's up to you.

646
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
These things you forgot

647
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
happened in a real way.

648
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Actually, I haven't changed.

649
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
These memories I lost

650
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
may be coming back soon.

651
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
I'll be waiting for you.

652
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
See you.

653
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
See you.

654
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
See you.

655
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
See you.

656
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Master.

657
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
I punished you yesterday.

658
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
You're not convinced,

659
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
so you'd better send one of you to make it up.

660
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
With your skills,

661
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
If you don't use your spiritual power, you will not be able to stand on the grass.

662
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,400
The loser will be punished by the rules of the West Mountain.

663
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,800
What's the big deal?

664
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,000
Master is really looking at us.

665
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You go and let him lose completely.

666
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
This is the West Wind Valley's lava, the heart of the earth.

667
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,400
With your current abilities, you can immediately melt the skin and cut the bones.

668
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,600
But don't worry.

669
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,800
Before you take off a layer of skin, I will definitely get you up here.

670
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
You won't die.

671
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Who dares to try?

672
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
I am willing to try.

673
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,800
I admit defeat. I am willing to be punished.

674
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
Master!

675
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,800
He's fine.

676
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
This...

677
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
Why isn't this lava hot?

678
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,400
It didn't stick to me either.

679
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
I just felt a familiar cold.

680
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,600
Master clearly mixed the water from the magical pond with lava to the top.

681
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
The two are in harmony, so it's not hot.

682
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,600
It won't get on your body either.

683
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I knew that Master wouldn't be this cruel.

684
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
It's just that Gao Cang doesn't know.

685
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,400
He just wants to follow his master's orders and is not loyal.

686
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Master is testing my words yesterday.

687
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,000
Didn't some of you keep questioning how Gao Cang is worthy of being your senior?

688
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
He is loyal to me.

689
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Just because of this, no matter how high his cultivation is, he can't be compared to me.

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And your senior, Bai Bai Shan.

691
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Tell me why your left hand is clearly useful, but your left hand is never useful.

692
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,000
This is my master's order.

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's a chance for me to change my mind and return to the West Mountain.

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I will obey my master's order and will never change it.

695
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Compared to them, you two are still far apart.

696
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,400
Master even went to investigate all these things.

697
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,000
He still is willing to try to believe what I said.

698
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,600
Master, I've read a few books on the ancient books of the Nintian tree.

699
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,000
I even made your favorite osmanthus cake.

700
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm reading the scriptures.

701
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I wonder if I'll get angry if I see myself being compared to the murderer.

702
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The new disciples of Master are all powerful and powerful in the court.

703
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They are all good at fighting.

704
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This can't be a coincidence.

705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This can't be a coincidence.

706
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Put it down.

707
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
All these days, you've been rebuilding the old books,

708
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and using the books to collect the power of the court and the other places.

709
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You even started a war to conquer the world when it wasn't done.

710
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So what?

711
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Have you thought about the consequences?

712
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Of course I have.

713
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Xue Ranran, don't think you can interfere in this matter.

714
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Master and I have been to the border town.

715
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We've seen the war and the people's lives.

716
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Master also said that it's not easy to be at peace.

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
In the present state, there are high-ranking states and cities.

718
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There are lords, dukes, princes, and soldiers.

719
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The people have no other choice but to live peacefully.

720
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But once the people are defeated,

721
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
the power of the different states will be shaken.

722
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If the people don't have a choice, they'll be defeated.

723
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But Master started his army so early.

724
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Did he really have the strength to win?

725
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's just a battle between the wind and the sky.

726
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He's just playing dumb.

727
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't care what you said, or you'll be the one to decide.

728
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But Master has also fought for peace.

729
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Why wouldn't he care?

730
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Enough!

731
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,200
I will believe in the nonsense you said about me.

732
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
I, Su Yi Shui,

733
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,800
will only seek the highest position in the world.

734
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,680
But the truth is,

735
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,040
you didn't take the world these years.

736
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,480
You sealed Ling Quan in the Demon Realm.

737
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,720
I don't want you to forget the path you took.

738
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,640
You're young and impulsive.

739
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,160
You're impulsive and regretful.

740
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,600
I wasn't an infant.

741
00:39:52,680 --> 00:40:01,480
You were

742
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
that moment when...

743
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,160
Master?

744
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,160
Master.

745
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,960
Lift him up.

746
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,840
He's...

747
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,440
Everyone stained him underground.

748
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,200
How재

749
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,380

750
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,500

751
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,000
I want注, two of them.

752
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,100
I want all of them.

753
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,000
I got the biggest one.

754
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,600
Master.

755
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,420
You haveżenie someone with me.

756
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,720
I left here in order to see you act like a boy.

757
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,180
Don't be angry, master.

758
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,380
It's all my fault.

759
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,500
I just medium me my sad and awful

760
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
.

761
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,120
to celebrate the Golden Lion Festival.

762
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,240
That's why I want you to come and see.

763
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,120
What does it have to do with me?

764
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,280
Because this Golden Lion Festival is for you.

765
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
Me?

766
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Nineteen years ago, the war broke out on Mount Xixi.

767
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,600
The plague was rampant.

768
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,880
Master, you were trying to save people before you died.

769
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,000
That's why you saved the people.

770
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,640
They thank you and respect you.

771
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,920
That's why they have this Golden Lion Festival every year.

772
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,640
Master, look.

773
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,520
For them, the heavens are far away.

774
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,200
But the people who can take care of them

775
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,160
and protect their lives

776
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,720
are the ones they truly respect.

777
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,880
Come and eat.

778
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,480
Miss Lan Zhan.

779
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
Remember to wait for me.

780
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,560
Go inside and eat wontons.

781
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay, Brother Xu. Thank you.

782
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Let's go.

783
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,040
Come.

784
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,960
Come.

785
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
It's the same.

786
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,440
The sauce is here.

787
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,160
Come, Brother Xu.

788
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,960
You're always so polite.

789
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,040
Mr. Song said he was going to save people.

790
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,880
How can I take money?

791
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,240
Brother Xu was suffering from the plague.

792
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,040
It's thanks to Master's help that he was able to survive.

793
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,400
That's why he's grateful to Master.

794
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,080
He never takes money when people from Mount Xixi come to eat.

795
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,040
Come.

796
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,440
Come.

797
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,840
Come.

798
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,240
Come.

799
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,640
Come.

800
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,240
Come.

801
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,040
Come.

802
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,640
Come.

803
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,240
Is it good?

804
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,840
Master has promised me before

805
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
to help me taste all the delicious food in the world.

806
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
If I were to take on the fire,

807
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,440
all of this would be gone.

808
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,440
Come.

809
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,240
Come.

810
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,840
Mr. Song, Grandma said she wanted to thank you.

811
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,840
Thank you.

812
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,560
Please drink it, Grandma.

813
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,240
This is delicacy and sn ingredient from a forest.

814
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,840
Choose something to eat with it.

815
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,440
Yes.

816
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,640

00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,880
I'm not afraid of the world with you

00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,680
I'm not afraid of the world with you

826
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,680
If love could make me right

827
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I would watch the sky when seeing you

828
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:35,680
