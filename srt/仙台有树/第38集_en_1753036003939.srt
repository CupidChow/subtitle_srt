1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
She's only 19 40 years older.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,340
She is only timeline-wise.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:55,420
It is fate了

4
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
etermine

5
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm not dead. Look at me.

6
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Xing.

7
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,220
Look.

8
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,220
I'm fine now.

9
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,820
Don't blame yourself, okay?

10
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,220
Go away. Lin Xuan is coming back.

11
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
I can't control myself.

12
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,820
I don't want to hurt you.

13
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,220
Go away. Go away.

14
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,220
Go away.

15
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
What are you going to do?

16
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
I'm fine now.

17
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm fine now.

18
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
As long as I'm dead,

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,220
no one will hurt you again.

20
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
It's not like that.

21
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,820
It's not like that.

22
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,620
You didn't hurt me.

23
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,420
Have you forgotten?

24
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,020
You defeated Lin Xuan and protected me.

25
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,820
I'm still alive.

26
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,820
Lin Xuan will never control you again.

27
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
I really didn't hurt you again.

28
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,820
I'm fine now.

29
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,420
Lin Xuan is still alive.

30
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,220
You can rest in peace.

31
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm fine now.

32
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,620
I'm fine now.

33
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,220
Lin Xuan is dead.

34
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
I'm fine now.

35
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm fine now.

36
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I'm fine now.

37
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,420
You're still alive?

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,620
I'm alive.

39
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,820
Don't be afraid anymore.

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,220
Let the nightmare end.

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,820
It's good that you're alive.

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,220
When a house has a tree,

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,420
it's not just a house anymore.

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,220
It's a home.

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,020
You can't even change the name.

46
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Master.

47
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Okay.

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
What is this?

49
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,020
I found it.

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,820
Master, Mr. Rong Yi.

51
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,500
ами

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,020
I see.

53
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,620
Master.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
There's so much of smoke in the room.

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,620
This is what a woman wants the most.

56
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
We're living in the same house.

57
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,820
It's not like you don't know why.

58
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,820
When the smoke rises,

59
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Yanran.

60
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,060
There was no place for me to stay.

61
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,940
But I should have stayed by your side

62
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
as my all-time favorite.

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,860
Yanran!

64
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,740
Qingge!

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm here.

66
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm here.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm here.

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
I can't go back to the past.

69
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
I can't go back to the past.

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I can't go back to the past.

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
I can't go back to the past.

72
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
I can't go back to the past.

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I can't go back to the past.

74
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
I can't go back to the past.

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I can't go back to the past.

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I can't go back to the past.

77
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
I can't go back to the past.

78
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
I can't go back to the past.

79
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I can't go back to the past.

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I can't go back to the past.

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
I can't go back to the past.

82
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
The last one of the flash was successful.

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
The last one of the flash was successful.

84
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
That's great.

85
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
How is he?

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
The dream is gone.

87
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
He can receive the golden pill.

88
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
The dream is gone.

89
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
He can receive the golden pill.

90
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
The dream is gone.

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
The dream is gone.

92
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
The dream is gone.

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Your Highness.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Watch out for the fire.

95
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I know it's fire.

96
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
I can see everything.

97
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
But this red-haired girl

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,820
I can't help but be happy.

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,820
My body is so numb and painful

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
that I can't feel anything.

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
So I want to try

102
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
to put this flesh into the fire.

103
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Will I be able to do it?

104
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Your Highness! Your Highness!

105
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Get up.

106
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Xue Yi, have you ever thought

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
if you were to start over

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
in this life,

109
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
which one would you choose?

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,820
I've never thought

111
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
that I would never be able to turn back.

112
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
No!

113
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
There are countless possibilities in life.

114
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
In the Three Thousand Realm,

115
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
there is always a starting point

116
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
that you must start over.

117
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Su Yu!

118
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Su Yu!

119
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
If you want to destroy the Heavens,

120
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
you must act on behalf of the heavens!

121
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Don't touch him.

122
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Xue Yi,

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
come to my side.

124
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
My good third brother

125
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
just went to the inn

126
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
and was released by Father.

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Are you going to do it now?

128
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Why didn't you deal with it?

129
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
Just because you were going to the Three Thousand Realm,

130
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
so you don't care

131
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
about anything here?

132
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Zhou Fei Hua,

133
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
how does this matter have anything to do with you?

134
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
When did you know it was me?

135
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
I can't see clearly,

136
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
but from the beginning,

137
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I could feel your body and breath.

138
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
After all, we are too familiar.

139
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
If you draw your sword for me again today,

140
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
would I still be unable to recognize it?

141
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
You...

142
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
are you not willing to let me go?

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Your Highness!

144
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Your Highness!

145
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Your Highness, you're awake!

146
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Your Highness!

147
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Where am I?

148
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
Your Highness,

149
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
this place is very far from the capital.

150
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
It's very quiet and secluded.

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Can you rest here quietly?

152
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
How dare you!

153
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
You dare to take me hostage?

154
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Do you know what you have done?

155
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
You have been in the palace for so long.

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
You have been in the palace for so long.

157
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
You have been in the palace for so long.

158
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Do you know what you have done?

159
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Take her away and hide her well.

160
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
This place is very high up in the sky.

161
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
There are also barriers that block your path.

162
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Your Highness, you can't go back.

163
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Why?

164
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Zhao Fei Hua,

165
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
have you ever taken revenge?

166
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Let me go back.

167
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
I want to go back!

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Just because of those three thousand barriers?

169
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Brother Qing once said that

170
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
everything has its rules.

171
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
How can a journey against the heavens be free of cost?

172
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
The one who told you that everything would change

173
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
has ever told you the price?

174
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
You know but you don't want to tell me.

175
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
That must be a very severe price.

176
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
That must be a very severe price.

177
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Right?

178
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Your Highness, do you know what this is?

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Your Highness, do you know what this is?

180
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
The water in Qizhou has been cleared.

181
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Thanks to Your Highness's three years ago

182
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
for not being against each other

183
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
and the construction of the farm has been successful.

184
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
The officials and the people

185
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
all have the provisions to fight the disaster.

186
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Your Highness,

187
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
this is a great virtue.

188
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
The people are grateful.

189
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
The people from all over the country are celebrating

190
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
with fireworks.

191
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Your Highness, please pray for us.

192
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Your Highness, in your heart,

193
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
there are still people.

194
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Your Highness, your promise...

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,780
The saltcarving miscarriage

196
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
has been performed on a very large scale.

197
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Please let the honors be contributed

198
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
by the Imperial Church for my sake.

199
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,820
It is Su Yueshui.

200
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
You're sending someone to catch Jiang Long.

201
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
My chance

202
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,540
is to find the person who can make Jiang Long talk

203
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,220
and get rid of the impotent Jiu Tong.

204
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
With this,

205
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,420
I will never let him escape.

206
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Let go of me.

207
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,620
I...

208
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,020
I'll help you find Jiang Long.

209
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Xiao...

210
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Don't panic.

211
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,820
I just helped him to untie the spiritual ground

212
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,620
and at the same time, I gave him the power to stop him.

213
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
After all,

214
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,020
to catch Qing Long,

215
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,620
you need a huge power.

216
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,020
I've agreed to your deal.

217
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
Xiao Wu.

218
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Are you okay?

219
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Just now,

220
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,020
I helped him to get into the death curse.

221
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,220
If you can't find Qing Long within five days,

222
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,020
Xiao Wu will definitely come back

223
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
and die in a broken hole.

224
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Don't worry.

225
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Five days later,

226
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
I'll find him.

227
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
I'll find him.

228
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
I'll find him.

229
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
I'll find him.

230
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
I'll find him.

231
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
I'll find him.

232
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
I'll find him.

233
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
I'll find him.

234
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
I'll find him.

235
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,020
I've heard about Jiang Long.

236
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
I won't let him die.

237
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Xiao Shuai.

238
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Ran Ran.

239
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
It's great.

240
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
You're fine.

241
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
It's Master's voice message.

242
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
The hidden gold building of Jiuhua Sect

243
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
may have records of double-dead ghosts.

244
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
You should hurry up

245
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
and remember to be careful.

246
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
It seems that your Master

247
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
has already won the spiritual power.

248
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
That's great.

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
When we find the clues,

250
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
we'll go to Ran Ran and find him.

251
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,020
Yes.

252
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,020
I'll go with you.

253
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
I'll go with you.

254
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,020
I'll go with you.

255
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
I'll go with you.

256
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I'll go with you.

257
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
I'll go with you.

258
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
I'll go with you.

259
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
I'll go with you.

260
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
I'll go with you.

261
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
I'll go with you.

262
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
I'll go with you.

263
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
I'll go with Ran Ran and Master right away.

264
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Wait.

265
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Jiuhua Sect is controlled by the Zhe Yin people.

266
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
We have to think of a perfect way.

267
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
By the way,

268
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Senior Brother's diamond armor

269
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
has been able to break through the East Palace.

270
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
We have one more Master Zeng now.

271
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
We can successfully sneak into Jiuhua Sect.

272
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Xie Er is right.

273
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
It's up to you.

274
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,020
You're not bad.

275
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Let's split up and look for him.

276
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I found him!

277
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
The book says that if we can find the first infected person

278
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
who can break through the Zhe Yin people,

279
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
after we kill his Zhe Yin people,

280
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
the rest of the Zhe Yin people will be eliminated.

281
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
That's great.

282
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Let's quickly bring this news back.

283
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Gao Mu,

284
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
you're here.

285
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm here.

286
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm here.

287
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
I'm here.

288
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm here.

289
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I'm here.

290
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm here.

291
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
You recovered so quickly.

292
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Very good.

293
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Give it to me.

294
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Let go of me.

295
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Let go of me!

296
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Let go of me.

297
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Let go of me.

298
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Let go of me!

299
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
It was a dream.

300
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
My spiritual power has decreased.

301
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
He's acting like a dream.

302
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
He's taking my spiritual power?

303
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,020
You still took the Jiu Tang Sect's head.

304
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Xiao Wu!

305
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
What's wrong?

306
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
I have some questions.

307
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Do you still remember the origin of the Ice Lotus Pool?

308
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
You were the one who took my spiritual power

309
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,020
to the Sky Mountain to protect me.

310
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Do you still remember the lantern I made for you?

311
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Every time I return to the West Mountain,

312
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
you always leave me a lantern

313
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
to light up the path ahead.

314
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
In the cave of the Five-Horse Formation,

315
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,020
you personally lit up the entire cave.

316
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
But in this life,

317
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
you forgot the past

318
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,020
and broke the lantern I made for you.

319
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Only later did I realize

320
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,400
that I had taken the

321
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,020
wrong path.

322
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Do you still remember

323
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
how you took me to the West Mountain?

324
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
And the wood chips on your head?

325
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
How many times did I give them to you?

326
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
Can you still remember them?

327
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
You were worried

328
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
if I would be able to remember them?

329
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
I remembered everything.

330
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
Every little bit of us

331
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
is engraved in my heart.

332
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
Only when you fall in love with me again,

333
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
will the soul-washing talisman be broken.

334
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,020
So, in order to not hurt me,

335
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
you'd rather break your own golden azoth.

336
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
For me,

337
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
you'd rather sacrifice all that moment

338
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,020
to remember everything, right?

339
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Fortunately, this time,

340
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
I didn't hurt you again.

341
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
What fortunately?

342
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,020
If I had known that it would be so dangerous,

343
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
I would have broken your soul-washing talisman.

344
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,020
I'd rather you didn't remember the past.

345
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I only pray that you are safe and sound.

346
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
That won't do.

347
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Only if you remember everything that happened to us,

348
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
wouldn't I be very ashamed?

349
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Until I entered the Demon Realm

350
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
and heard what you said,

351
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
I only knew that

352
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
you took my spiritual power

353
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
to protect the people.

354
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
But it was also because you saw

355
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
the ending of me being trapped in the Heaven Book

356
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
and being possessed by the Demon,

357
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
and being in a state of disarray.

358
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,020
That's why you wanted to save me.

359
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
Even if you defy the Heaven,

360
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
you still wanted to change my fate.

361
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I didn't know about all of this.

362
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,020
You've done so much for me.

363
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I know nothing.

364
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
Xiaoshui,

365
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,020
I saw your heart in your dream.

366
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
You always feel sorry for me.

367
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
You think

368
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
if I hadn't met you from the beginning,

369
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,020
I would have been better, right?

370
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
That's not true.

371
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,020
Have you ever thought about the opposite?

372
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm very happy

373
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
that I can meet you.

374
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
Whether it's in the past or in this life,

375
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
it's always like this.

376
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Even if there are twists and turns in life,

377
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
and difficulties,

378
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
in life,

379
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
there's no right to do what you want.

380
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
The experiences we've had together

381
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
make me feel that

382
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
every day we've had

383
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
is full of life and death.

384
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
I'm so happy

385
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
that I can meet you.

386
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm not a living person.

387
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
I'm a living person.

388
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
I made some medicinal food.

389
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
You can eat it while it's hot.

390
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Xiaoshui, let go.

391
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
You have to listen to your master

392
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
or I'll punish you.

393
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Master?

394
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Are you my master now,

395
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,020
or am I?

396
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
What should I do?

397
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
I was the one who took you as my disciple.

398
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
There must be a way.

399
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Of course I'm your master.

400
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
You have to listen.

401
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Fine.

402
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
But,

403
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
there's still a chance to turn the tables.

404
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
And unfortunately,

405
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm...

406
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Dragon God.

407
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,020
It seems that Su Yishui's problem is solved.

408
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Then I'm relieved.

409
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
Thank you for your kindness.

410
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,020
You've caused a lot of trouble for Long Island.

411
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,020
You're the saviors of Qing Luo.

412
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,020
As long as you're safe,

413
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
everything will be fine.

414
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
Qing Luo?

415
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
This reminds me of something important.

416
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Dun Tian is going to start the Three Thousand Sects.

417
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
He's going to the Great Ling to sell his position.

418
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
He needs to use the Three-Sons to make a living.

419
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I saw it on Long Island that day.

420
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Dun Tian needs the son of the Demon.

421
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,020
So he's been trying to lure you into the Demon.

422
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
As for the son of the Emperor,

423
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
he's Su Yu.

424
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
But the third son...

425
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,020
The third son is the son of the Dragon.

426
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
The son of the Dragon?

427
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
I've learned from Dun Tian.

428
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
To start the Three Thousand Sects,

429
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,020
you need to gather the son of the Emperor,

430
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
the son of the Dragon, and you.

431
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Although the demon in my body is out,

432
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
I won't be the demon he wants anymore.

433
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,020
But I was always forced to escape from the Ling Quan.

434
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
Dun Tian has been in the dark for so many years.

435
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm afraid he won't have any other preparations.

436
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
So I think we have to guard Long Island.

437
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Please be careful, Dragon God.

438
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Qing Luo and the others are playing around the island.

439
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
I'll go get them back.

440
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
To strengthen the barrier of Long Island.

441
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
In case something happens.

442
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Dun Tian needs the third son

443
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,020
to start the Three Thousand Sects.

444
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
I'm afraid he won't let you go easily.

445
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
You have to be careful.

446
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Then just now...

447
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
The West Mountain is in trouble.

448
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Zeng Yi and Gao Cao have already arrived at Cuiwei Mountain.

449
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
Master.

450
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
Yes.

451
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
What happened?

452
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
There's good news and bad news.

453
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,020
The good news is that we've found a way to eliminate the Veiled Man.

454
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,020
As long as we kill the first Veiled Man of the Double-Eye-Devil,

455
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,020
the other Veiled Man will naturally disappear.

456
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
That means...

457
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
the other Veiled Man will disappear?

458
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Yes.

459
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,020
That means we have to find out who is the first Veiled Man.

460
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,020
This is good news. What about the bad news?

461
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
We wanted to return to the West Mountain

462
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
and tell the news to He Da Bai.

463
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,020
But we just arrived at the entrance of the mountain and found a blue blood stain.

464
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,020
I didn't think they would still attack the West Mountain.

465
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Did you get stained by those blue blood?

466
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Fortunately, you gave us a special pill.

467
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
The pill will not disappear until the end of time.

468
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,020
This will not affect our scent.

469
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
What about the others?

470
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
When we arrived at the mountain,

471
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,020
we already used the scent of the single-leaf clover to detect the wrong ones

472
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
and prepared to lure the enemy.

473
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
But we didn't even see the shadow of the enemy.

474
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Those blue blood stains were like rain.

475
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Many people were attacked.

476
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Wen Hong Shan and Yan Liang Yu, two seniors,

477
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
took advantage of the opportunity and sent out a full-scale formation.

478
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,020
They took some people to escape and are now hiding in the mountains.

479
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,020
I didn't expect that the West Mountain could not be helped.

480
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,020
Fortunately, the Cui Wei Mountain has already set up a barrier.

481
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,020
But the shadow of the enemy still cannot be easily defeated.

482
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
The West Mountain is out of control.

483
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
The Ling Mai is now in the hands of the Heaven.

484
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm afraid that his plan has been pushed further.

485
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
The first shadow of the enemy to be eliminated

486
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
is the fastest way to get the Ling Mai back.

487
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Who?

488
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Be careful. He is the shadow of the enemy.

489
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
The power of the shadow is so weak that

490
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
you still dare to sneak around here.

491
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Who is sneaking around?

492
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
I came to find someone to cooperate.

493
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I know who is the first person like this.

494
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
You...

495
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
Let me go!

496
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
It seems that he didn't want to live.

497
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
That day, I met that double-headed ghost.

498
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
I thought he had killed Tu Jiu Yuan.

499
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
I cut his head in a fit of rage.

500
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
I just had a little bit of blood on my hands.

501
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,020
So you mean that the shadow of the enemy is Yuan Tong?

502
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,020
I was the first to be attacked.

503
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,020
The shadow of the enemy is a double-headed ghost.

504
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
It is infected and then re-invaded.

505
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
After you killed him, the blood was still wet.

506
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
That is indeed a good thing.

507
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
You are the first one.

508
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
You don't know that the fake goods

509
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
were not able to kill me on the spot.

510
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,020
Instead, you used another way to poison me.

511
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
But when you fall asleep, you are in a dream.

512
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
You are in need of spiritual power.

513
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
That's right!

514
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Every time I close my eyes,

515
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,020
I can see someone who looks exactly like me.

516
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,020
He is holding my neck and breathing on me.

517
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
What are you looking at?

518
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
I have not closed my eyes for a few days

519
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
just to prevent the fake goods.

520
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Even more despicable is that he...

521
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Why do I smell a strong smell of vinegar?

522
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,020
I came to look for you because I was lost.

523
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Otherwise, you would think that I wanted to see you two

524
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
kissing each other.

525
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Just tell me.

526
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Are all these strange things related to that...

527
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Dun Tian?

528
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
That's right.

529
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Then I have found the right person.

530
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
When I was in the You Realm, he was the one who attacked you.

531
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,020
He is the one who came to you.

532
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
In the end,

533
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,020
I owe you everything.

534
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,020
So, if you don't solve all these problems,

535
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
I will not spare you.

536
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
If I am killed,

537
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,020
I will not spare you.

538
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
No need to say that.

539
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Because of the death of so many people,

540
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
we must solve the current crisis as soon as possible.

541
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,020
But, what is Dun Tian doing with so many people?

542
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
What does he want to do?

543
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
He wants to use the Zhe Yin Man to control the Xuan Gate.

544
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
He wants to open the four doors of the Xuan Gate and the spiritual veins of the Immortal Mountain

545
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
to build the Three Thousand Towers.

546
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Three Thousand Towers?

547
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
What is that?

548
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
There are three thousand in the world.

549
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
One is a thousand and one is a thousand.

550
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
There are different existences of us in every world.

551
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
There are even different immortals.

552
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
The Three Thousand Towers

553
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,020
are the entrances to the Three Thousand Parallel Realms.

554
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Every realm has different us?

555
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Then...

556
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
Then, what is Dun Tian trying to do?

557
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
He wants to enter the Three Thousand Towers

558
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,020
to find a parallel realm that he is satisfied with.

559
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,020
In that realm, he did not choose to fly.

560
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
He stayed with his wife.

561
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
The family shared the joy of the Celestial Wheel.

562
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
Dun Tian regrets it.

563
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
He wants to replace that realm's self

564
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
and come back.

565
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
There is such a regret in the world?

566
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
I am not a person who can regret it.

567
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Why do you have such a regret?

568
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
The realm and the realm are separate and separate.

569
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,020
They are not connected.

570
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
If you want to forcefully cross the realm,

571
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
you have to pay a huge price.

572
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
That is to destroy

573
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
the realm we are in.

574
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Only if our world becomes a cloud

575
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
and the jade in the Three Thousand Towers

576
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
will completely collapse.

577
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
Only then will its path

578
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
truly begin.

579
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
He treats me as a pawn

580
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
and let out the devil's devil's devil.

581
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Now he wants to kill me and rely on himself.

582
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
It was not easy for him to get all this.

583
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Stop thinking about it!

584
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
It is a good thing that the Three Towers in the Three Thousand Towers

585
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
are no longer under the control of Dun Tian.

586
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Now, we just have to get rid of

587
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
the people from all the sects

588
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
and get back the spiritual vein.

589
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
Then Dun Tian will have no other choice.

590
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Perfect.

591
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
You help me get back the Chiyan Mountain.

592
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
We can then solve

593
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
that fake goods that pretended to be mine.

594
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
We can then solve that fake goods that pretended to be mine.

595
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Let's work together.

596
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
You want to persuade us to help you get back the Mountain Gate?

597
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
We indeed have to go to Chiyan Mountain

598
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
to get rid of that person who is your enemy.

599
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
But we can do this ourselves.

600
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Now, you are low on spiritual power

601
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
and only have the remaining specks left.

602
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
What use is it to you?

603
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
I know a secret path.

604
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
We can sneak into the inner part of Chiyan Mountain

605
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
and kill them without any hurry.

606
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
We can save a lot of trouble.

607
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Deal.

608
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
But,

609
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
if we sneak into Chiyan Mountain, we can't kill them.

610
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
We also have to prevent

611
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
being stained by the blue blood.

612
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I've been studying the shadow of Zhao Ying

613
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
for the past few days.

614
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
If I wear this on my body,

615
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
once I have something to collect,

616
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
I can turn it into a shadow barrier

617
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
and protect people from it.

618
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
I'm thinking of a way to strengthen it.

619
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I should be able to block the blue blood.

620
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Bai Shan,

621
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
these past two days, help Uncle Zhao Ying

622
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
to make these shadows.

623
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Yes, Master.

624
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Once we have done this, we can immediately go to Chiyan Mountain.

625
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Wait.

626
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
There's one more thing.

627
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
I know a secret path to Chiyan Mountain.

628
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
But I have a condition.

629
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Su Yushui,

630
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
sleep with me.

631
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
I haven't slept for several days.

632
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
That fake goods

633
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
is just a demon power

634
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
that can take advantage of my

635
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
tiredness and lack of sleep.

636
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
It's a spiritual power.

637
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
But if I can use a strong

638
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
spiritual power to disturb it,

639
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
it won't work.

640
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
Help me protect it.

641
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
I'm not interested.

642
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Su Yushui,

643
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
I'm with you now.

644
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
If I die, it's not good for you.

645
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Just let me

646
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
sleep peacefully.

647
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
I promise,

648
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I won't bother you in the future.

649
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Su Yushui,

650
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Su Yushui,

651
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
only you and Brother Mu Qing's

652
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
two skills can help me protect it.

653
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
If you don't help me,

654
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
then I'll go to Brother Mu Qing.

655
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
There's a beautiful girl

656
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
in the back.

657
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
She's a romantic ghost.

658
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Beauty Mu,

659
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
I...

660
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Come with me.

661
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Master and Wei Jiu,

662
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
will they be in trouble?

663
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Give me some peace.

664
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Don't worry.

665
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,020
I have you.

666
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
I won't bother Beauty Mu.

667
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Then I won't bother you.

668
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Sleep here.

669
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
I haven't slept so comfortably for a long time.

670
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Get out when you wake up.

671
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
You helped me absorb the spiritual power

672
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
from that fake body.

673
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm afraid you'll drag your hind legs.

674
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
I've always been

675
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
a man of my word.

676
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
I'm afraid you'll drag your hind legs.

677
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
I'm afraid you'll drag your hind legs.

678
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I'm always clear about my grudges.

679
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I'll repay you.

680
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
You're helping me.

681
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
Tell me.

682
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
How do you want me to thank you?

683
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Then please

684
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
throw away the rest of the quilt.

685
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
I love clean clothes.

686
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
I can't stand it.

687
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm wearing a uniform with a lot of fabric.

688
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I changed to a new one after I came out of Chiyan Mountain.

689
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
It's very clean.

690
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
You're loyal to the clan.

691
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
You're quite a man of your word.

692
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
You...

693
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I...

694
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
You...

695
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
You dare to threaten me?

696
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
You didn't sleep last night

697
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,020
because you were worried about Wei Jiu, right?

698
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,020
I'm very sleepy.

699
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
I haven't recovered from my injury.

700
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Then after you finish your breakfast,

701
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
you can go rest for a while.

702
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,020
Don't worry about Zeng Yi and their magic weapons.

703
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
I'll help you.

704
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
What's so fragrant?

705
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Buns?

706
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
It's really delicious.

707
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Beauty Mu,

708
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
did you make this?

709
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
The sweet potato you gave me

710
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
was very delicious.

711
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
I didn't expect that

712
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,020
you would make something better.

713
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Sweet potato?

714
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,020
When we were in the Tianmai Mountain,

715
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
you were healing and sitting down.

716
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I saw that he was very hungry,

717
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
so I gave him some.

718
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
You didn't finish it?

719
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Don't you know how sweet that sweet potato is?

720
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Shut your mouth after you eat the buns.

721
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Wei Jiu!

722
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Did you drink up all the good wine

723
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
that you hid in your brain?

724
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
You said you were lost.

725
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
Can you be a little more patient?

726
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Drinking a glass of wine

727
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,020
is a sign of your alcoholism.

728
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
Fine.

729
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
Let's not talk about the wine.

730
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
I saw you just now

731
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
throw away the quilt

732
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
that Ran Ran sewed for Su Yushui.

733
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
I couldn't stop it.

734
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Su Yushui was seriously injured

735
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
and unconscious that day.

736
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
Ran Ran

737
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,020
stayed up for several nights

738
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
and sewed it by herself.

739
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Where did you throw it?

740
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
I just found a mountain top and threw it away.

741
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
I don't know where it fell.

742
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Where is he?

743
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,020
I looked all over the mountain

744
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
but I couldn't find him.

745
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
Are you a very virtuous man?

746
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
I didn't know it was you who sewed the quilt.

747
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Otherwise, I wouldn't let Wei Jiu run away.

748
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
It's just a normal quilt.

749
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
If you lost it, then you lost it.

750
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Why bother to look for it?

751
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
This is not a normal quilt.

752
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
It's the quilt you sewed for me.

753
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
It's more important than anything.

754
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Fine.

755
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
If you like it,

756
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I'll embroider a bamboo for you.

757
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,020
I'll be happy if you like it.

758
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I'll be happy if you like it.

759
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
How about I embroider a bamboo for you?

760
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
If you can,

761
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
it's better to embroider a pair of round eyes.

762
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
You're quite good at it, Xiao Shui.

763
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Don't forget

764
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
I'm the master now.

765
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
No one can be a master like you.

766
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
You can't even write a quilt.

767
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I'll teach you.

768
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Done.

769
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
So, the quilt-washing thing

770
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
can make people so satisfied.

771
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
Shan Shan,

772
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
you don't know how much I cherish

773
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
what's in front of me.

774
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
So, I won't let Dun Tian succeed

775
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
and take it away.

776
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
You two were here.

777
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
It's a bright day.

778
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
You two...

779
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
You two are all masters.

780
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
You don't practice.

781
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
You don't care about the situation.

782
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
You're so stubborn.

783
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,020
You're so stubborn.

784
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,020
Why do you always like to talk about it?

785
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
Master Wei,

786
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
you're just saying that

787
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
grapes are sour.

788
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
You're not a person

789
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
who doesn't love you.

790
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Tu Jiuyuan is willing to

791
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
sacrifice his life for you.

792
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
But you don't know your own good.

793
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
You...

794
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,020
He used to

795
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
sacrifice his life for me.

796
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
But I can't believe

797
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
he was so rude to me

798
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
in Chiyan Mountain that day.

799
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
I don't dare to think

800
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
if he's already...

801
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
Are you worried that

802
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Tu Jiuyuan is fake now?

803
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
And he's dead now?

804
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
That bastard

805
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
won't even let go

806
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
of my wife and child.

807
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,020
I won't let him go either.

808
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
Wife and child.

809
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
If he accepts you,

810
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
he'll climb up the pole himself.

811
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
I...

812
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,020
And I heard that

813
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,020
there's a demon in the back of Chiyan Mountain.

814
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,020
Do you really think that

815
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
you can survive

816
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,020
if you fall into a coma?

817
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
Is it because you're lucky?

818
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
What do you mean?

819
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
You mean

820
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
he was the one who protected me that day?

821
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
Give us some more time

822
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
and have some luck.

823
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
When we lose,

824
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
our body and soul

825
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
will never change.

826
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Go and buy some daily things

827
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
so that you don't get any jelly.

828
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Give us then.

829
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,420
I'm here to tell you that Zhao Yongzhong has recovered.

830
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,220
We're going to kill him and save his wife and child.

831
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,020
It doesn't matter if he recognizes him. I'll recognize him anyway.

832
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
It's the direction of Jiuhua Sect.

833
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,620
Jiuhua Sect's spiritual vein has been opened.

834
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,820
Without Kai Ta's eye, there's no sign of the beast in his hand.

835
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,220
The shield hasn't given up on opening the Three-thousand-striking-Way Pillar.

836
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,420
It's true that he's hiding some kind of secret.

837
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
What secret is he hiding?

838
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
No matter what, we have to kill all the people of Zhe Ying.

839
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,020
We have to take back the Xuan Gate and close all the spiritual veins.

840
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,020
He has no three-thousand-striking-Way Pillar and no spiritual vein. What else can we do?

841
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,420
Let the Nine Immortals and Liang Wu Meng stay in the Mountain of Cuiwei.

842
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,020
Let's save a place first.

843
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,020
The rest of us, let's head to the Mountain of Seven Night.

844
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
What is that?

845
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,820
The Xuan Gate's spiritual vein should be in the direction of Mount Kong Sect.

846
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,420
The shield is about to open the Three-thousand-striking-Way Pillar.

847
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,220
So you still want to go to the place where you said it's the most suitable for Hu Xin Yi.

848
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,420
Whoever doesn't want to try what I want,

849
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,220
I have too many regrets, too many regrets.

850
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,420
Since I have such a chance, of course I have to try something different.

851
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,420
Your Highness, do you still remember him?

852
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,020
I don't believe it.

853
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,020
I can't conquer this little peach tree.

854
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,020
When I learn it, I'll blow it for you.

855
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,620
Okay.

856
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,420
It's really good to be young.

857
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
But...

858
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,020
I don't know how to be young.

859
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
I'm still young.

860
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:12,220
It's a pity that I can't go back to the past.

861
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,020
This peach tree is just a piece of object.

862
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,420
It's not even the same as before.

863
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:26,820
It's just a memory related to it that can bring back the love and memories in your heart.

864
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:33,620
Do you think that the so-called Hu Xin Yi's memory has that kind of thing?

865
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,220
The Qing Ge you've been waiting for,

866
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:42,420
in that world, he won't have that kind of experience and memory with you.

867
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,820
What's the point?

868
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,820
I can hear these songs every day.

869
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,620
What are they singing?

870
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,620
What they're singing is a song for peace and prosperity.

871
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,820
And they're praying that life like this can last forever.

872
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,420
The Wu family is old and young, hoping that I'll return.

873
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Hurry and return home.

874
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,820
The water is so bitter.

875
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,820
What? You want me to plant this thing into the dust

876
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,820
and then kill it?

877
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,420
Please spare me, Your Majesty. I was just confused. I won't do it again.

878
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,420
When did you know that I was fake?

879
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,220
Did you do it quickly when I was kidnapped?

880
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,820
I don't know anything. I don't have that kind of ability.

881
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,020
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

882
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,820
Is this the secret passage you're talking about? What's the difference between it and the dog cave?

883
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
The secret passage naturally has to be hidden.

884
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,820
Could it be that I have to set up a pig's trotter gate?

885
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,020
The sky is blue, the clouds are dark.

886
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:23,820
The tears are like dreams, this part of me is so lonely, I'm already in tears.

887
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:30,820
The moon in front of me is returning, my heart is still watered down.

888
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:37,820
The tears in my eyes are still not resolved.

889
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:44,420
The moon in front of me is returning, my heart is still watered down.

890
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:51,420
The wind is still blowing on my side.

891
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:58,220
With you by my side, I'm not afraid of the world.

892
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,820
If I could only have one more year,

893
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,020
I would be willing to sacrifice myself for you.

894
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,820
The moon in front of me is returning, my heart is still watered down.

895
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,420
The wind is still blowing on my side.

896
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,820
With you by my side, I'm not afraid of the world.

897
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:25,420
If I could only have one more year, I would be willing to sacrifice myself for you.

898
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,020
If I could only have one more year,

899
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,620
I would be willing to sacrifice myself for you.

900
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,820
I could not escape from this fate,

901
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,020
hoping that we could turn back time.

902
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,620
I once thought of you in my heart,

903
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:59,020
but we met again when I was in the prime of my life.

904
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I once thought of you in my heart,

905
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,020
but we met again when I was in the prime of my life.
