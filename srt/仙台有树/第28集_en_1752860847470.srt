The Love by Hypnotic

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Love by Hypnotic

The Love by Hypnotic

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 19

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
Or your rules will respond.

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,160
Ruan.

9
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,040
Master.

10
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,680
We're in thelevant Marcaliśmy淨.

11
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
You let me one more cake stand.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,280
Shan'an.

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,720
Shan'an.

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,160
You have the disadvantage of a piece of cake to stir cleansing honey.

15
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
I can't lose you.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
I can't use the spiritual roots to cultivate you.

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,920
I can also try the cultivation method.

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
Anyway, until the end,

19
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
let's not give up,

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
okay?

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
You're still

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,040
so insincere.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Master,

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
you're crying.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
In the future,

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
I will regret it.

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I was tricked by Master

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
and forced to go to the West Mountain.

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,480
I've never been bullied like that.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
You remember it?

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
Just a little bit

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,280
of what happened when I was in the West Mountain.

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Master was not as gentle as he is now.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,720
If you remember more in the future,

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,760
and even think of Su Yu,

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
you will know

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,920
that you were supposed to be on his side.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm afraid

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
you will be disappointed.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm afraid you will.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Then I won't regret it.

42
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,400
I don't remember much about the past.

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
I can't

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,840
say anything to forgive you,

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,000
and not blame you,

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
and comfort you in place of the past.

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,800
But I can see my heart

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,200
and my current feelings.

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
I remember Master's every protection

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
and every time he was soft-hearted.

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,360
I like Master.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
I hope

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,600
you can live a long life.

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,160
If I remember everything,

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
I'll tell you later.

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,320
I made the decision myself anyway.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
We can have a fight.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
You're out of energy.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,600
How can you fight?

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,240
Then Master will tie himself up

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,880
and let me beat him up.

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,320
We've wasted

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
many beautiful moments in the past.

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Now,

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,920
let's not miss

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
every moment before and after the battle.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,760
Okay.

68
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
In the future,

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,400
no matter what happens,

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
let's fight together.

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't let go of anyone's hand.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,520
Okay?

73
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay.

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,480
Who's then the personILL

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:35,440
who became

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,440
the chairman of ShengМeryon?

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,440
Who's the first to come to лиar?

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,100
I've been working as an orderly until now

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,720
Ok

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,840
Well

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,560
it seems that you can't be a local

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,240
You should be exchanges with Qingrong

83
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,220
It's a Полche-마- embarassment

84
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,600
Your Highness

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,120
연신 survives

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
Don't wait for whom

87
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,840
Well

88
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,180
this time

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,040
Lingquan and Qingrong

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Why?

91
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
Why did he choose to die again?

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
I've been working in the camp for so many years.

93
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
But nothing has changed.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,520
I don't want to die.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
No. I can't die.

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,040
You have a way, right?

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,480
Think of a way.

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't let Su Yuesheng run away.

99
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Get out.

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Guards.

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,320
Guards.

102
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Guards.

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
The plan was successful.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Since Su Yishui was with Ling Quan,

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've started to set up

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,760
to let Su Yu lure Su Yishui into the palace.

107
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,120
I've asked Ling Quan to return to Demon's Body.

108
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,520
I don't know if Ling Quan

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,120
is now in Su Yishui's body.

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
But don't worry.

111
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,600
I'll keep an eye on Su Yishui.

112
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,320
I'll make sure you come back soon

113
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
and take control of everything.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Xue Ranran is the mother?

115
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes.

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
Interesting.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
I've said that mother and brother are not right.

118
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
Xue Ranran is indeed

119
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,920
quite attractive to me.

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
So that's how it is.

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,960
Su Yishui is the most evil and cunning person.

122
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,560
You said that the dragon

123
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,160
dragged them to the sea?

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,200
The demon of the East Sea is the ocean of eternity.

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,880
There's a dragon in it.

126
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
It should be where the dragon is.

127
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
But it's hard to fight on the dragon island.

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,520
It's hard to keep an eye on Su Yishui.

129
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
They're going to the shore.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
They'll go to the sea and guard it.

131
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,760
No matter how deep

132
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,440
you hide Su Yishui,

133
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Ling Quan and Mu Qingge will be in my hands.

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
Your Majesty, wait!

135
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,880
Tu Jiuyuan, you're really going to rebel.

136
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,920
I'll be loyal to you next time.

137
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
I'll help you take Ling Quan

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,320
and the Flaming Fist

139
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,120
to fulfill your wish.

140
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,560
I just hope you can calm down.

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,920
Calm down?

142
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,680
Feel at ease of remaining loyal to Mu Qingge

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,160
for all the next 10 years.

144
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
Tu Jiuyuan,

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,360
how can you ever dare

146
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,920
to intervene with my secret affairs?

147
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,480
Su Yishui is willing to fight against the Mysterious Sect

148
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,560
for Mu Qingge.

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,840
He's been wasting all hisudge

150
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,560
to boot up Mu Qingge again,

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,320
I will also be reborn as the crazy Mu Qingge.

152
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
It's better to have one more life than one less.

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
I have the spiritual power.

154
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,920
I was going to get involved with Su Yishui.

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,400
It's no use for me to grab Mu Qingge.

156
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm afraid that Su Yishui

157
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,320
will be a black hearted fox.

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,520
If not,

159
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Just stop.

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,760
Don't panic.

161
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
You look like

162
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
it's nothing

163
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
for me.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm getting jealous.

165
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,480
Yes,

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
so what?

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Last time, I made them up,

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,800
but you gonna give me that rubbish,

169
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,680
thinking that I'm a piece of trash.

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Zhou Ying, how dare you.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
What I want, of course,

172
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
are not these things.

173
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
What do you mean?

174
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,320
Don't you understand?

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I only want a true heart.

176
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,240
I do.

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,640
I've liked you since earlier.

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,920
I liked you the moment we fought together.

179
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Shut up!

180
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
What a ridiculous story!

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
You think I'd believe it?

182
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't remember.

183
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,920
We never fought together.

184
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
You and I were born enemies.

185
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
We only know when we win or lose.

186
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,520
Are you kidding me or are you dreaming?

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,920
You forgot.

188
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,720
We practiced martial arts and swords together.

189
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,720
You said you'd seal me off when the mountain opens.

190
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
What a ridiculous story!

191
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,720
When we get the power and open the mountain,

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
I'll reward you with a butterfly bone.

193
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,720
As long as you don't have those unwritten dreams,

194
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
accept your ridiculous thoughts,

195
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,520
stay by my side and do what you should do.

196
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Elder!

197
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
Sit down.

198
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Do you know your condition?

199
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,520
You're pregnant.

200
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
That's the time.

201
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Master.

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
Master.

203
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,920
Master.

204
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,320
Master.

205
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
You're drunk.

206
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,520
Why are you running away?

207
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,120
You...

208
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Why are you here?

209
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,520
I don't want to be with him anymore.

210
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
I'll only suffer the evil.

211
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,120
What do you mean?

212
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,520
You can't suffer anymore.

213
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
The master should know.

214
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,520
Why should he know?

215
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,320
I humiliated myself and expressed my feelings to him.

216
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
He was so angry and crazy.

217
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,320
Did he have to give up on me?

218
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,120
He just told me to be a good daughter-in-law.

219
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
But you didn't say

220
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
that you'll be able to hide it from him

221
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,320
when he grows up.

222
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,720
At worst, I'll take him to get the spiritual power,

223
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,120
wash the Flaming Fiery Sword, and open the Chiyan Mountain.

224
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,520
I'll complete my oath to the old master.

225
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,120
I'll leave Chimen.

226
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Elder, you're thinking like this?

227
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,320
I tried my best to be loyal to him in Chimen.

228
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,520
He couldn't see it.

229
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,920
You said that I wouldn't be soft.

230
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,120
But I gave up my position and treated him badly.

231
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,720
I even gave him my heart.

232
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
But I never got any true feelings from him.

233
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm tired.

234
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,520
But the elder is born in Chimen and grows up in Chimen.

235
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,120
Where will he go when he leaves?

236
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,520
I think the elder should tell the old master

237
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,920
that he won't be born in Chimen.

238
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,520
There will be a chance.

239
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,520
The wash of the Flaming Fiery Sword is a big thing in Chimen.

240
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,120
The old master is here.

241
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,720
Let's wait until this matter is over.

242
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,320
The Flaming Fiery Sword has disappeared

243
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,320
since the last time the Ghost Fist was triggered.

244
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Yesterday, the Ghost Fist was triggered,

245
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
and the Ghost Fist was triggered.

246
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
And I, Jiuhua,

247
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,320
have received the imperial edict from the crown prince.

248
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,520
So the Ghost Fist was caused by Su Yishui.

249
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,920
The Demon Lord was caused by Su Yishui.

250
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,120
He deceived us.

251
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,120
He deceived us.

252
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,720
We must find the Demon Lord as soon as possible.

253
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Otherwise, the world will be in chaos again.

254
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
I don't know what method he used

255
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
to hide the Ghost Fist.

256
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,720
He couldn't even capture the Ghost Fist.

257
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,520
The message from the crown prince

258
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,920
is that the direction of the Demon Lord's disappearance

259
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,720
is the East Sea.

260
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Please send more disciples to find the whereabouts.

261
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,920
But Su Yu is in a bad situation.

262
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Will Zhou Fei Hua be implicated?

263
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,120
The person in the Art Gallery is not strong enough.

264
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,120
He will do his best to save Su Yu.

265
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,720
But he is in a bad situation and is physically exhausted.

266
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,920
He won't live long.

267
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
As for Zhou Fei Hua,

268
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
I have sent a message to Yutong and Yuchen.

269
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Tell them to be careful and protect him.

270
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,520
Don't worry.

271
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Go to sleep.

272
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Rest well.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Okay.

274
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Brother Zhao,

275
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,320
you weren't in the city a few days ago.

276
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,520
It's hard to see that scene.

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
A dragon flies, a phoenix flies.

278
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,720
Isn't this the sign of Rui Xiang?

279
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,320
You are right.

280
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,920
I have an cousin who is in the palace.

281
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,120
He said that the crown...

282
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,520
He said that the crown prince needed magic in the palace

283
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,920
to control the

284
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,320
Tian Jiang's anger.

285
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,920
The Eastern Palace was destroyed.

286
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,120
The crown prince even lost his sheep and animals.

287
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
The imperial physician is helpless.

288
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm afraid that...

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Stop talking.

290
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,720
Let me tell you.

291
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
His Highness went downstairs.

292
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
He said that someone was at the door and he was disturbing him.

293
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You guys go back and guard.

294
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Yes.

295
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
Go.

296
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,920
Hurry.

297
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
I can't bear to leave.

298
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,320
Why must I leave?

299
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
Take him down.

300
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,720
You wanted me to come.

301
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
My master is in all the small and big hotels in the capital.

302
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
He spread the news that I'm seriously ill near the city gate.

303
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I know

304
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,320
that you will come back because you are worried about me.

305
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,720
You always trust me.

306
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,120
Yes.

307
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm really afraid that something will happen to you.

308
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
But you are scheming against me.

309
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Zuo Yun,

310
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,720
I thought that

311
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
we really were in love and we were rich.

312
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,120
But

313
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I don't really understand you.

314
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
You scolded me.

315
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,120
But you still care about me.

316
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
I naturally don't want to see anything happen to you.

317
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I'm looking forward to your recovery.

318
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
But

319
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I don't want to see you fall into the abyss of no return.

320
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,120
But in this world, there is nothing that is a perfect match.

321
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,120
There are things that can be done if you ask for something.

322
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Nonsense.

323
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
These past years, you have been

324
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
doing very well by my side.

325
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
I understand your feelings for me.

326
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
I know

327
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
that you are sincere towards me.

328
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
I know that

329
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
you are sincere towards me.

330
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Don't worry.

331
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I won't make things difficult for you.

332
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I don't want to hear you say these false words.

333
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,120
You are clearly cold-hearted.

334
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
You risked the risk of a popular political situation

335
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
and you want to lure me into your dream.

336
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
You want to use me as a bait

337
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
and force Ran Ran to show up, right?

338
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Yes.

339
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
You are sincere towards me.

340
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
He is sincere towards you.

341
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
You came for me.

342
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,120
He will come for you.

343
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,120
And Sui Yi and Shuai Bi will come for him.

344
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm so stupid.

345
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I've been deceiving myself for over ten years.

346
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,120
I thought that my true heart could be replaced by the real one.

347
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
I didn't expect

348
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
that I would be a tool

349
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
in your eyes.

350
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,120
So what if you use me to force Ran Ran to show up?

351
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Can you still be in his eyes?

352
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Take him to the Cold Palace.

353
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
After we have a deal,

354
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
don't hurt him.

355
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Su Yu, Ran Ran won't be fooled.

356
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Everything you planned won't work.

357
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Yes, Mother.

358
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Yes.

359
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Look.

360
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
He's so arrogant.

361
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
He's so arrogant.

362
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
He's so arrogant.

363
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
He's so arrogant.

364
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
He's so arrogant.

365
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Let's go.

366
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
This is the Cold Palace.

367
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Beauty Zhou is locked here.

368
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
The defense laws in the palace

369
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
have not been fixed yet.

370
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
The defense laws in the palace

371
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
have not been fixed yet.

372
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I think it's not difficult to get in.

373
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
But the Eastern Palace won't be distracted by this.

374
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
The repair work of the art gallery

375
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
must be a bad omen in the Cold Palace.

376
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
It's waiting for us to enter.

377
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
The Crown Prince locked Beauty Zhou

378
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,120
just to force the master and Ran Ran to show up.

379
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Then we'll go east and west.

380
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
We'll split up.

381
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Let's go in from here.

382
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Let's go in from here.

383
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Su Yu Chen is here!

384
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
And there's Ran Ran!

385
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
After him!

386
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
After him!

387
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Ran Ran, don't get caught by Su Yu again.

388
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Don't say it.

389
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,120
It's really familiar to ride a horse on a mountain.

390
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
You guys?

391
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I'm Yu Tong.

392
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
This is my brother, Yu Chen.

393
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm here to help you get through the battle.

394
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Master, you slept so well.

395
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
You slept for three days.

396
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
My wounds don't even feel painful anymore.

397
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
They healed so fast.

398
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Could it be that you haven't slept for three days

399
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
and you've been using your spiritual power to heal my wounds?

400
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
I don't sleep at night.

401
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't sleep at night.

402
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Spiritual power has entered my body.

403
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,120
It's more connected to the demon aura in my heart.

404
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I need to wake up at all times

405
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
to prevent spiritual power from entering my body.

406
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I can't let it hurt you again.

407
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Master, you're not relaxing like this.

408
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Isn't it very tiring?

409
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I've already become like a phantom mirror.

410
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
It's fine if I don't sleep for ten days and half a month.

411
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Besides, the essence of spiritual power

412
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
is to limit the greed of people

413
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
and to seduce the demon in their hearts.

414
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
My obsession with this life is already around me.

415
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
It's hard for spiritual power to seduce me.

416
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
If spiritual power comes to seduce me,

417
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Master, please hug me and kiss me.

418
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Let the spiritual power be irreversible.

419
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
You're still so shameless.

420
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,120
If shamelessness can make Master smile and smile,

421
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I'll be even more shameless.

422
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Besides, we've already made contact with each other.

423
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Master is mine.

424
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I can kiss him as I want.

425
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
You're right.

426
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
In that case,

427
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
can I have my love token back?

428
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Love token?

429
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Master, you mean the wooden hairpin I made with my skills?

430
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Yes.

431
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,120
When you gave it to me, I was drunk and didn't know who gave it to me.

432
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I knew it was you.

433
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I wanted to ask you, but I was wrong.

434
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
I kept the wooden hairpin in my room.

435
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
It's not my intention to take it away from Muran Wu.

436
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,120
If someone else takes this hairpin away next time,

437
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
I don't care about the reason.

438
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I'll only play with you.

439
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I'll keep it well for the next meeting.

440
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Slow down.

441
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
If you get hurt or hit by it,

442
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
it'll only get better after a while.

443
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
The wind is strong at the beach.

444
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Hold me.

445
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
I'll pass the spiritual power to you.

446
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
It can resist the wind and cold.

447
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Master Qian's hands.

448
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
How can I be not happy?

449
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
It's still here.

450
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,120
This is the eternal sea of the East Sea.

451
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Not far from here is the Dragon Island.

452
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
The Dragon Island is one of the paths

453
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
that the immortal world goes to.

454
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
There are some traps.

455
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Outsiders can't enter.

456
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
It has the blood of the dragon, so it can get through.

457
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I asked it to leave, but it refused to leave.

458
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Why don't you go home?

459
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Has anyone been waiting for us?

460
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
How did you know I was hungry?

461
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
This should be its food.

462
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I fed it some of the Green Star Pill you made.

463
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
The dragon fell into the hands of someone else.

464
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I never taught it how to kill.

465
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
To get its spiritual power,

466
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
it can generate some magic.

467
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Your Green Star Pill can eliminate the magic.

468
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
It looks like it's working well.

469
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
You're thoughtful.

470
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
But you should go home.

471
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
After you go home, you'll have many companions.

472
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
You should spend more time with your companions.

473
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Learn how to build a building.

474
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Don't fall into the hands of the bad guys.

475
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
If it weren't for you,

476
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I wouldn't have been able to fulfill my promise to Dragon Mother.

477
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Thank you, Master.

478
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,120
What you think is what I think.

479
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Don't say thank you again.

480
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I'm so hungry.

481
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
I'm going to start preparing for the meal.

482
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
But if you want to hold my hand forever,

483
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I'll be waiting for you.

484
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I'll be waiting for you.

485
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I'll be waiting for you.

486
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
If you want to hold my hand forever,

487
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I can't handle this.

488
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Don't bother me when you just recovered.

489
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Come, sit down.

490
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
If you want to eat, I'll do it.

491
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Can you do it, Master?

492
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Why not?

493
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
It's just a meal. Is it hard?

494
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I...

495
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
You can teach me too.

496
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm sorry.

509
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I'm sorry.

510
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Sure.

511
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Master asked me what I want in real life.

513
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,620
I think it's nice now.

514
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm not sure if I can do it.

515
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,760
But I don't think

516
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,120
I can achieve my dream

517
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
only when I'm at peace.

518
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,920
When I seal the spiritual power,

519
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,920
and solve the big trouble

520
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
that will haunt me in the future,

521
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,720
I won't be late.

522
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,720
Ranran,

523
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
I know you want to go to the Youjie with me.

524
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,520
But your spirit root has been hit.

525
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Master,

526
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,320
I said that I would change my way of cultivation.

527
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,920
I didn't come here for a fight.

528
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,920
I still remember

529
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,120
a set of magic tricks I created myself.

530
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,920
The Spirit-Breaking Galaxy?

531
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
The more I think about it,

532
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,920
the clearer I am.

533
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,720
The Spirit-Breaking Galaxy

534
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,120
contains the magic of the talisman formation.

535
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,720
And it's the most powerful power

536
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
that can use the power of the spirit root.

537
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,120
The five elements of the heaven and earth,

538
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,720
wind, rain, thunder, and fog,

539
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,320
gold, wood, water, fire, and earth,

540
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,120
are all the sources of power.

541
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,720
I take the spirit of the heaven and earth,

542
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,120
and the heaven and earth enter my heart.

543
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Everything

544
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
breaks the Spirit-Breaking Galaxy.

545
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,120
So that's how it is.

546
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,120
I use the power of the heaven and earth

547
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,320
to cultivate my original nature.

548
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
But later,

549
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I rely more and more on my own power.

550
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,120
I can't help but feel

551
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,920
that I'm not worthy of the power of the spirit root.

552
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
I rely more and more on my own position

553
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
and the talent of the spirit root.

554
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,920
But the magic of the heaven and earth

555
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,320
has no more power to move the power of the heaven and earth.

556
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,920
I'm just not very familiar with it.

557
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
I'll get better and better

558
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,720
if I practice more.

559
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,120
The power of the heaven and earth

560
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
is more endless than the power of the original.

561
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Master, believe me.

562
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
I can do it.

563
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
I believe you.

564
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,520
So you can't say

565
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
that I can't go to the You Realm anymore.

566
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,320
The Xuan Yin bottle is broken.

567
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,920
You've been working day and night to protect the spirit power.

568
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
It's really hard.

569
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
Although this island is good,

570
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,720
we have to do something serious.

571
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
We should leave now.

572
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Third Prince.

573
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,520
How dare you!

574
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm here to listen to His Majesty's advice

575
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,320
and write the imperial doctor Chen,

576
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
who was just sent here to visit the Crown Prince.

577
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,320
How dare you stop me?

578
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,120
Third Brother is here.

579
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Come in, please.

580
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
A few days ago, I had a dragon's shadow

581
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,320
on the top of the Eastern Palace.

582
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,720
It was so noisy that I heard everything.

583
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,120
All the prime ministers in the court were worried about the chaos

584
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,520
and came to visit frequently.

585
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,320
I was really tired of dealing with them.

586
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,520
So I asked them to stop me.

587
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,520
But you're here again.

588
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,720
Since Father has sent you here,

589
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
I think you should

590
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
not let him down.

591
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Imperial Physician Chen, please.

592
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
How is it?

593
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Your Highness.

594
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Your Highness is very strong

595
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,320
and has a good body.

596
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,320
It's a good thing

597
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
that you're healthy.

598
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I'll report to His Majesty

599
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,520
and let him rest in peace.

600
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,120
Imperial Physician Chen, please.

601
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
After the worship ceremony,

602
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,120
I'll go to the palace

603
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,320
to see Father in person.

604
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,720
The medicine is burning.

605
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,520
Give me another one.

606
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,520
Hurry up.

607
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,520
I've told you

608
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,120
that the medicine

609
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
will boost your health and blood pressure.

610
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,920
It's for the cost of your blood

611
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
to be consumed quickly.

612
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,520
Your Highness,

613
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,320
it's a good thing

614
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,320
that you don't need the medicine

615
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
to help the Third Prince

616
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,520
and soothe the people.

617
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,520
What's the last time

618
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,320
you didn't give me a change of nerves

619
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
and took back

620
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,720
Su Yishui and Xue Ranran?

621
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,720
And you took away Zhou Feihua.

622
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
What else can you do?

623
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,920
The disciples of West Mountain took away Zhou Feihua

624
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,320
and went out of the capital immediately.

625
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
The direction is clear.

626
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,920
It means that they have contacted

627
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Su Yishui and Xue Ranran.

628
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,720
And that Lingquan

629
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,720
didn't appear in Su Yishui's body.

630
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,120
But

631
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
they must have gone to the You Realm

632
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,920
to return Lingquan.

633
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,120
That's my chance

634
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,120
and your chance.

635
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
What do you mean?

636
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,120
There is a more powerful person

637
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
in the You Realm.

638
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,720
He can control Su Yishui.

639
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
If we can find him,

640
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,320
then you don't have to

641
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,720
turn into a demon with seven shoes

642
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
and you don't have to occupy anyone's body.

643
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,520
You can do whatever you want.

644
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,120
I have returned Wanna Be Your Man

645
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,120
and became an我也

646
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,220
and the people have already called me.

647
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
They will be here soon.

648
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
It's cold.

649
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,120
Don't bother.

650
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm fine as long as you hug me.

651
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
I'm fine.

652
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Qingge.

653
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Feihua.

654
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Did my ear or eyes break?

655
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,120
What did you call me just now?

656
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,120
Qing...ge?

657
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Qingge of Mu Qingge?

658
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,320
Yes.

659
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,120
Ranran is Mu Qingge.

660
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Su Yushui.

661
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,520
Stay away from Qingge.

662
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,720
You still have no memory of the past.

663
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
You want to lie to her again?

664
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
Feihua.

665
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,720
Don't do this.

666
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,120
Master won't harm me.

667
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,120
Besides, I'm the one who took the initiative.

668
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,120
You don't remember who Su Yishui is?

669
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,720
Let me tell you.

670
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,720
At the battle field of Fanyao,

671
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
my father was in the army.

672
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,920
You came to me with a heavy wound.

673
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,920
Your spiritual power couldn't be suppressed.

674
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,520
You told me some nonsense.

675
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Su Yishui is the devil.

676
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,720
You were born with the spiritual power to save him.

677
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,120
Nonsense.

678
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Su Yishui.

679
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,720
Even the people around you don't know your true face?

680
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
You killed Qingge with the symbol of

681
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
killing the evil demon in front of the people.

682
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,920
Master didn't do that.

683
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,320
He was just a man.

684
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
He was too young to be saved.

685
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
You believe him?

686
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
All these years,

687
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
you let the world scold Qingge

688
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,320
for the evil son's harm.

689
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
But you never clarify it.

690
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
What else do you have to say?

691
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Qingge.

692
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,320
You still can't see it clearly?

693
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
He's right.

694
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
I...

695
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,520
Half of the words

696
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,320
are not worth admitting.

697
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,920
It's not like that.

698
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,120
There's a spell.

699
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,120
It's the seal spell.

700
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,720
I gave you the spell at that time.

701
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,120
I didn't want you to mention the truth about the evil son.

702
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,120
I always wanted to tell everyone the truth.

703
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,120
I know.

704
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,320
You're the one who did it.

705
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
You're the one who killed Qingge.

706
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,520
You're the one who killed Qingge.

707
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,520
You're the one who killed Qingge.

708
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
You're the one who killed Qingge.

709
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Qingge.

710
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,520
Don't be silly.

711
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
He's not worthy of your trust.

712
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,520
Master is the evil son.

713
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
He was born with a destiny.

714
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,120
It's not his wish.

715
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,120
Just like the dragon we saved in the capital.

716
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
He was born by the evil man.

717
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,720
But no one cares about him.

718
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,320
He's born with a demon's blood.

719
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,120
What if someone points out a way for him?

720
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,320
Master has been

721
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,120
confused all the time.

722
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
All the mistakes in the past

723
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,720
are all in the past.

724
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,920
Let's move forward.

725
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,920
Master, go back to your room.

726
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm here.

727
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,720
Miss Fei.

728
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,920
Don't regret it.

729
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I never regret anything.

730
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,120
You're still the same you.

731
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,520
You've come back to life.

732
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,520
You've fallen in love with the same person.

733
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,120
You're on the same road.

734
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
It's like everything is arranged.

735
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,160
Immortals?

736
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,560
How can there be immortals in the You Realm?

737
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,800
What's wrong?

738
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,800
You said I was badly injured

739
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,080
and couldn't control my spiritual power.

740
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Who was the reason?

741
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,560
I asked you

742
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,320
if Su Yushui hurt you.

743
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
You said no,

744
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,120
but you didn't tell me who it was.

745
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,080
By the way,

746
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,040
when you were talking nonsense,

747
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,320
you said something like

748
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,240
you wouldn't let the ending be true.

749
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,360
It's like you know

750
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,280
something great is going to happen.

751
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,200
By the way,

752
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
you asked me to take this

753
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,280
to Su Yishu's study.

754
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you.

755
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
I hope this book is really useful

756
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,440
and can help you find the entrance to the You Realm.

757
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,200
If Su Yishui is willing to

758
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,600
send her spiritual power back to the You Realm,

759
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,440
it's a blessing in disguise.

760
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,040
Otherwise...

761
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,800
She will.

762
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,720
I was caught this time,

763
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,680
and the Zhou family was also confiscated.

764
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,160
Fortunately, Su Yishui had planned

765
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,200
to transfer my family to the capital safely.

766
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,760
I really need to thank him for this.

767
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,520
My father took his family back to the capital.

768
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,920
I will go to meet them.

769
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,160
It's all our fault that got you involved.

770
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm sorry, Feihua.

771
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,560
It's not you.

772
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,200
Su Yu and I

773
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,720
and the Zhou family

774
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,920
will be in trouble sooner or later.

775
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,880
Su Yu's ambition is the world.

776
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,960
Half a king and half a tiger.

777
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,760
Besides,

778
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,920
it's a vicious tiger that's been forced into the dead end.

779
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Feihua.

780
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,680
But as you said,

781
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,000
it's all in the past.

782
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,200
Since it's changed,

783
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,280
I should let it go

784
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,480
and live my own life.

785
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,600
Feihua.

786
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
You can use these talismans in emergency.

787
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,800
If there are some that you can't handle,

788
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
come to Xishan to find me at any time.

789
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,240
Take care.

790
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,680
Take care.

791
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,560

792
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,280
