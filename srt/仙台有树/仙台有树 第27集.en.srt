00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,979
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,510
Master.

4
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,040
I have nothing to say to him.

5
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,570
I'll just pretend to faint.

6
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,710
Ranran!

7
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,560
Your Highness, please rest assured.

8
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,620
She should be fine.

9
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,430
Servants!

10
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,030
Yes.

11
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,079
Quickly send her back to the Cool Breeze Palace.

12
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes.

13
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,190
The Four-Way Waterways have been cleared.

14
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,520
She's of no use anymore.

15
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,280
When did you realize...

16
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,970
I'm not her?

17
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,960
To be honest, I found that something was wrong with you

18
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,290
the first time I saw you.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,710
I was just blinded

20
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,120
by the longing

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and expectations

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,100
over the past 18 years.

23
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,800
From the moment you entered the palace,

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,060
you were full of flaws.

25
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
You're nothing like Qingge.

26
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,320
Even if you're deliberately pretending,

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,520
it's not convincing.

28
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,360
Luckily, what Su Yishui did

29
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,220
made me realize

30
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,380
that pushing you, this imposter, out to draw attention

31
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,820
wasn't a bad idea.

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,000
Otherwise, why do you think

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,860
I would keep you around this long?

34
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,050
Everything was a lie to me?

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,060
Your kindness to me

36
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,280
was also a lie?

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
When you said you wanted to marry me,

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,810
that was also a lie?

39
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,930
What do you expect?

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,430
Su Yu!

41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,960
I've been by your side

42
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,560
longer than she was.

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,870
And we were once

44
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,960
very close.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,950
I took care of your daily life;

46
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,790
you trusted me and were gentle with me.

47
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,200
Have you forgotten?

48
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,680
Even though I've made some mistakes

49
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
and may have wronged others,

50
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,090
I've given you

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,390
all my heart!

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Can't you feel

53
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,870
my love for you

54
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,310
at all?

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,510
Have you even

56
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,510
moved yourself with your own words?

57
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,920
I feel that, compared to me,

58
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,400
you prefer the power

59
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,600
I brought you.

60
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,670
That's because...

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,390
That's because I want to become stronger!

62
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,510
I want to help you!

63
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,730
You just want to achieve your own goals.

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,170
And I'm just your best stepping stone.

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,700
It's you...

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,390
It's you who refuses to trust me.

67
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,590
Even if what you said is true,

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
so what?

69
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,080
My heart has always

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,570
belonged to Qingge.

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,520
What do your feelings have to do with me?

72
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,570
No need to keep her.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,060
Protect the Crown Prince!

74
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,510
Are you alright?

75
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,440
Don't be afraid.

76
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,550
I took the Spiritual Power Token.

77
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,520
I'll take you out of here!

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,120
You...

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,580
I spent a lot of money collecting many

80
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,070
high-quality magical weapons before.

81
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,600
Even if we have to use them all,

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,070
we'll force our way out!

83
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,560
Let's go!

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,830
The esteemed guest's pulse is steady,

85
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,360
and there's no major issue.

86
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,120
No issue?

87
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Then why hasn't she woken up yet?

88
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,400
Your Highness.

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,260
Your Highness.

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm fine now.

91
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,909
Your Highness, please go back and rest.

92
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,940
Ranran, you're awake?

93
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,290
Quick, help His Highness back to his chambers.

94
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,090
Hurry up.

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
How are the preparations going?

96
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,460
Everything is ready.

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,750
After the wedding ceremony the day after tomorrow,

98
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,600
we will

99
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,360
transfer your soul into a new mortal body.

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,270
Good.

101
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,040
Bai's spiritual power is weak after being injured,

102
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,940
and the formation barrier

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,270
has little effect on it.

104
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,250
It's most suitable

105
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
for sending messages in and out.

106
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,160
Master is trapped in the body of the Green Dragon.

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
On the Double Ninth Festival,

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
he will break through the siege.

109
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
How is he going to break through?

110
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,590
What can we do?

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,950
Everyone, look here.

112
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,320
This is the palace defense formation map

113
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,549
predicted by Ranran.

114
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,480
This formation is formed by malicious energy.

115
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,880
She marked several breakthrough points.

116
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,630
These points are all along

117
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,490
the outer edge of the palace walls

118
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
and need us to break them.

119
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,980
Using the formation-breaking talisman water,

120
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,180
we should be able to break these points.

121
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,150
The day after tomorrow is the Double Ninth Festival,

122
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,120
and we must complete this task before then.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,000
But outside the imperial city,

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,780
there are guards everywhere patrolling and keeping watch.

125
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,240
The problem is how we can remain undetected.

126
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,260
Perhaps...

127
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,240
we don't have to do it ourselves.

128
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,840
The mechanical puppet Mr. Zeng Yi taught me

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,170
is driven by a mechanism

130
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,650
and is unaffected by the formation.

131
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,650
I can modify it into a mechanical bird.

132
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,000
It can fly to the formation points,

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
with the talisman water hidden inside,

134
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,240
then scatter the water over the points.

135
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,100
How about that?

136
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,090
Not bad.

137
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,610
Make a few more.

138
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,000
Try to make them look like the birds

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
that often fly outside the palace,

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
so that they won't be discovered.

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,330
Don't worry.

142
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,120
There's still one problem.

143
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,960
Ranran wants to find out

144
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,120
the exact location of the core of this formation.

145
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,630
Does anyone have any ideas?

146
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,030
Ranran said this formation

147
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,830
was formed by malicious energy.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,080
The core of the formation

149
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,550
should be where the malicious energy is most intense.

150
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,010
The surrounding soil and water are likely contaminated with malicious energy.

151
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,670
I might have a way.

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,650
How is it?

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,630
Malicious energy has a unique foul, fishy smell,

154
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,630
and I can smell it.

155
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,600
The stronger the malicious energy,

156
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,220
the stronger the smell

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,720
in the surrounding soil and water.

158
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,380
This way, I can locate the core of the formation.

159
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,210
Can you do it?

160
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't worry.

161
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,870
I'm using my Earth Spirit Root,

162
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,800
my primal power,

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
so I won't need to mobilize much spiritual power.

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,870
I just need to take a bit of soil out.

165
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,140
The defensive formation shouldn't detect it.

166
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,400
Where should we start?

167
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
Since all this mess

168
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,850
was caused by the Crown Prince,

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,120
let's start

170
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
with his Jingyang Hall.

171
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,970
Alright.

172
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,000
This is the soil from beneath Jingyang Hall.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Smell it.

174
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,600
Is it?

175
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,170
The smell is a bit faint.

176
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,630
Let's try somewhere else.

177
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,300
Okay.

178
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,910
Go right.

179
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,890
Let me smell it.

180
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,720
Where is this from?

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
That is the place.

182
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,530
Madam Battle's Palace.

183
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,150
So the core of the formation is here.

184
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,080
Bai.

185
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,270
Go.

186
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,000
Master.

187
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,120
Master?

188
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,160
I'm here.

189
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,600
Are you alright?

190
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,090
So far, everything is going smoothly.

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,390
It's just that...

192
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,510
I miss you.

193
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,080
This technique drains your energy.

194
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,340
Don't use it too often.

195
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,270
I have one thing

196
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,390
I'd like to ask you.

197
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
Tell me about

198
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,190
the past between Su Yu and me

199
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,490
when I was Mu Qingge.

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,750
Master?

201
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,650
Master, don't be upset.

202
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,550
I just want to know my enemy,

203
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,120
so I can find the right opportunity

204
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,090
to stall Su Yu.

205
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,870
Su Yu once gave you a meal,

206
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,320
so you owe him a favor.

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,270
So the core of the formation

208
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,870
is at Madam Battle's Palace.

209
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,720
Master,

210
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,870
I'll use the Divine Tree to enter the core of the formation

211
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,930
and try to break it.

212
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,200
From now on, I won't be able to talk to you

213
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
through the Divine Tree.

214
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,320
We'll meet

215
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,790
on the Double Ninth Festival.

216
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,960
Take care of yourself

217
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,820
and wait for me.

218
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,670
Your Highness.

219
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,550
The food here is awful.

220
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,850
Who would eat this?

221
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,150
If you want to eat anything,

222
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,870
just say it.

223
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,550
I'll have them make it.

224
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,200
Forget it.

225
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,690
They can't make the flavors I want.

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,690
How about...

227
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,550
you let me cook it myself,

228
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,120
just like before?

229
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,200
What before?

230
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,390
I seem to remember

231
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,510
that when you invited me

232
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,510
to Prince Zong's residence in the past,

233
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,810
you always reserved a kitchen

234
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,810
for me to cook.

235
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,670
Qingge,

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,900
you remember those times with me now?

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,860
I only vaguely remember a little.

238
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,410
I was talking about me cooking.

239
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,670
Don't interrupt.

240
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,680
Once you move into the Eastern Palace,

241
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,690
I'll have them build a kitchen

242
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
and a wine cellar for you.

243
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,630
What do you think?

244
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,080
But not now?

245
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,240
Are you still wary of me?

246
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,720
But Su Yu,

247
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,320
do you really think

248
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,440
that after you forced me into marrying you

249
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,670
with the lives of those people from Xue Village,

250
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,790
I would just obediently accept it

251
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,650
and live a peaceful life with you?

252
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
Will promises for the future be of any use?

253
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,770
Will you not need to be wary of me in the future?

254
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,290
In the future...

255
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,220
In the future, I will have plenty of time.

256
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,840
You and I

257
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,650
will naturally have a long future ahead.

258
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,750
The auspicious time has come.

259
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,390
Crown Princess,

260
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,030
please go to Madam Battle's Palace

261
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,120
to receive the imperial decree

262
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,030
and perform the grand ceremony.

263
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,840
It's not yet 12 PM.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,020
[Madam Battle's Palace]

265
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,070
Ranran,

266
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,900
you're walking a bit slow.

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,920
Do you know that I've been waiting for this moment

268
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,270
for nearly 20 years?

269
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,800
Well, there's no rush for this moment.

270
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,040
I built this Madam Battle's Palace

271
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,720
for you.

272
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,280
Today,

273
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,800
it finally waited for the return of its master.

274
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,140
He's been a part of our lives for half of them.

275
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,950
Today, he will personally witness

276
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,220
our grand wedding.

277
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,920
It can be considered

278
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,050
my final resolution

279
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,860
for him.

280
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,590
After our ceremony is complete,

281
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,570
this body will be mine.

282
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,780
In less than 15 minutes,

283
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,000
it will be noon,

284
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,830
and Master will be able to break through the Inquiry Pond.

285
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,970
Perform the auspicious ceremony!

286
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,900
Face southeast!

287
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,920
Bow to the heavens and earth!

288
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,110
Wait a moment.

289
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
The world is vast, with so many directions.

290
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Why are we bowing only to the southeast?

291
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,320
I don't think this is right.

292
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,440
Then let's bow to all four directions,

293
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,360
okay?

294
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,880
Well...

295
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,460
That seems more acceptable.

296
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,350
Turn!

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
Bow!

298
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,830
Turn!

299
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,780
Bow!

300
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
Turn!

301
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,270
Bow!

302
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,030
Turn!

303
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
Face north!

304
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,000
Bow to His Majesty!

305
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,810
With your parents here,

306
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,880
if I don't personally meet them and bow to them,

307
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,740
wouldn't that be disrespectful?

308
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,820
Your Highness,

309
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,350
how about you take me to meet His Majesty in person,

310
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,150
so we can pay our respects to him?

311
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,070
Ranran.

312
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Stop fooling around.

313
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,510
Continue.

314
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,760
Bow!

315
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,400
Wait.

316
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,470
Yu,

317
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I remember now.

318
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,830
I've been here before.

319
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,300
You said the palace

320
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,880
received a tribute of fine wine from overseas

321
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,140
and secretly brought me here to taste it.

322
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,110
I remember that this place

323
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,240
wasn't Madam Battle's Palace before.

324
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,200
It was...

325
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,270
a garden,

326
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,440
right?

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
That's right.

328
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,440
I shared many thoughts with you

329
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
back then.

330
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,370
Do you remember?

331
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,790
I only remember us

332
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,360
laughing and chatting,

333
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,980
happy and sincere.

334
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,320
We used to be...

335
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,480
We used to be good together, of course.

336
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,000
But I've told you, Yu,

337
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,730
I don't like being forced.

338
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,790
Su Yu.

339
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
I don't want to marry you.

340
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,030
Xue Ranran,

341
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,530
you actually used Mu Qingge to deceive me.

342
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,440
Do you think Su Yishui

343
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,100
can really escape my control?

344
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,750
How could that be?

345
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,790
You've been stalling

346
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,200
because you want him

347
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
to take the opportunity to break through the barrier,

348
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,480
right?

349
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,720
Do you really think I couldn't foresee this?

350
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,280
Feng has already set up

351
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,010
an immortal net over the imperial city.

352
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,830
If his first strike fails,

353
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,430
he will be trapped by the net.

354
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,990
He has nowhere to run now.

355
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,320
Let's not waste any more time.

356
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,960
Continue with the ceremony.

357
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,600
Let go!

358
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,030
Don't hurt my master!

359
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,000
Ranran,

360
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
this is the end.

361
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,560
You have to accept it whether you like it or not.

362
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,240
Su Yishui won't escape.

363
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,040
His body is mine.

364
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,400
And so are you!

365
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,030
Didn't you want me

366
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,750
to marry you with my own face?

367
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
Let's complete the ceremony now

368
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,240
and fulfill the final wish

369
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
of this body.

370
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,250
Come on!

371
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,970
Let's perform the bowing ritual!

372
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,380
Who said I have no backup plan?

373
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,960
The defensive formation has been destroyed from underground!

374
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,420
Explore the underground?

375
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,640
Su Yu might

376
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,400
be able to figure out my plan.

377
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
He'll definitely take precautions.

378
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920
The foundation of the palace's defense formation

379
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,850
is underground.

380
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,260
If we can find the core

381
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,310
and completely destroy the formation...

382
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,400
Our spiritual power

383
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
won't be suppressed anymore.

384
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,250
It's a permanent solution.

385
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,480
I can use my spiritual power now.

386
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,890
Hurry up and exchange our bodies!

387
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,510
Master, your mortal body!

388
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,510
Let's go back now!

389
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Let me send you to a safe place first.

390
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,550
It would be too late by then!

391
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,160
Ranran!

392
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,140
Use the magical weapons to suppress him!

393
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,590
Master, don't worry about me!

394
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,310
Hurry up and take back your mortal body!

395
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,640
You are more important!

396
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,400
The original spiritual power

397
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,930
of this body was preserved.

398
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm quite satisfied.

399
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,720
Master,

400
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,090
let's knock him out

401
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,690
and directly take your body.

402
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,190
What's happening?

403
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,880
Master!

404
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,440
This Green Dragon was raised by me.

405
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
To tame it,

406
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,210
I used quite a few methods.

407
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,400
Like burying some talismans

408
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,480
inside its body

409
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
to better control it.

410
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,240
Xue Ranran,

411
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
this body is mine now.

412
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,940
Su Yishui won't come back.

413
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,370
You wish!

414
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,590
Our wedding ceremony hasn't been completed yet.

415
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,190
Come here!

416
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,640
Oh no.

417
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,000
Master was using the spiritual power of his Golden Core

418
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,590
to suppress the Spirit Spring.

419
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,110
Now, with all this commotion,

420
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,660
this body's spiritual power has become unstable.

421
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,720
The Spirit Spring naturally wants to take the opportunity to break free,

422
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,580
shattering the Heavenly Bottle.

423
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,400
I can finally come out.

424
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm going to be free!

425
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,510
The body of the Demon's child

426
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,040
is the one most suited to me!

427
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,070
No!

428
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,110
Don't!

429
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
Ranran.

430
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,370
Ranran, be careful!

431
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,960
Ranran!

432
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,240
Ranran, be careful!

433
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,150
Su Yu, wake up!

434
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,000
You've gone to great lengths to take over my body.

435
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,860
Are you really going to accept it?

436
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,270
Get out of my master's body!

437
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,500
Ranran, don't!

438
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,510
Su Yu?

439
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Anyone who ruins my plans

440
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,740
deserves to die!

441
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,590
The golden talisman is not working.

442
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,520
What should I do?

443
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,840
Don't you dare hurt her again!

444
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,140
Ranran!

445
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,540
The Vermilion Bird's blood!

446
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,030
Right.

447
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,510
The Vermilion Bird is a sacred object for exorcising demons.

448
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,250
Little Vermilion Bird,

449
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,900
could you let me

450
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,230
take some of your blood?

451
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,240
Ranran!

452
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,070
Ranran!

453
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,240
Ranran!

454
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,980
Oh no.

455
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,770
His primordial spirit is about to dissipate.

456
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,110
Change the formation, pursue his spirit,

457
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,240
and let his primordial spirit return!

458
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,310
[Somewhere near the East Sea]

459
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,640
Is Master's body

460
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,750
still possessed by Su Yu?

461
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,640
Oh no.

462
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,310
All the golden talismans and elixirs on me

463
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,030
are gone.

464
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,060
Who are you?

465
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,170
Don't move.

466
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,830
You took the collision of demonic energy

467
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,750
without even trying to dodge.

468
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,880
Your bones are cracked.

469
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,510
Do you want to be bedridden for the rest of your life?

470
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,240
Su Yu,

471
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,510
give my master's body back to him.

472
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,310
I'll give you anything you want.

473
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,350
I'll even marry you if that's what you want.

474
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,720
If you want to be reborn,

475
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,720
I'll give you my body.

476
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,590
How?

477
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,610
Haven't I told you that

478
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,370
you must not

479
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
sacrifice yourself for anyone?

480
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,110
Master,

481
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,350
it's you!

482
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,160
I've brought you back.

483
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,720
And you want to give your body to Su Yu?

484
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,350
It's just a temporary measure.

485
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,430
It's to lower his guard

486
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,030
so I'll have time to find a way.

487
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,240
Master, you're back.

488
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,460
It's so wonderful.

489
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,150
♫After parting, the black silk-like hair turned snow-white♫

490
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,680
The Vermilion Bird's blood you gave me

491
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,810
was very effective.

492
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,160
It suppressed the demonic energy of the Spirit Spring.

493
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,920
♫In secret, I've been missing you, dreaming about you for years♫

494
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,510
As for Su Yu,

495
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,960
he failed in taking over my body,

496
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
so his foundation was unstable.

497
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,200
The Vermilion Bird's blood treated his primordial spirit

498
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,080
♫Awaiting the destined love, a déjà vu so real♫

499
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,880
as an evil being

500
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,810
and drove it out.

501
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,590
Stop crying.

502
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,370
♫I'd trade three lifetimes of grandeur for your one fleeting bliss♫

503
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,580
The Spirit Spring is still inside.

504

♫Gradually gravitate toward you by love♫

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,170
I just got a bit close to you.

507
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,450
Why did you move away?

508
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,680
You were quite decisive

509
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,400
when you kissed Su Yu.

510
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,929
♫Only after I met you♫

511
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,670
Kiss?

512
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,199
That was me

513
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,320
forcing the Spirit Spring out

514
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,550
by feeding him Vermilion Bird's blood.

515
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:21,070
♫Did I realize there are heaven-like places all because of you♫

516

Besides,

517
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,159
that was your mouth.

518
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,800
Even if it was a kiss,

519
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,350
it was between me and...

520
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,360
♫Maybe a lifetime is too short, too fleeting♫

521
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,620
♫So we were granted a second chance♫

522
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,040
♫With endless time to write our story♫

523
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,420
♫We fulfill the vow forged through many lifetimes♫

524
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,060
♫From now onwards♫

525
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,050
I shouldn't have...

526
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,280
Shouldn't have what?

527
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,440
Are you going to do the same thing you did at the Wester Sect—

528
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,030
pushing me away even though

529
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,280
we feel the same way?

530
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,110
You always make decisions on your own,

531
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,150
but never ask me.

532
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,400
But in the end,

533
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
I still got involved.

534
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,630
Master, have you ever thought about

535
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,880
how you would handle this

536
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
if I hadn't come?

537
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,400
I've already cast a spell on myself.

538
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,060
The Spirit Spring has long been bound to my body.

539
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,650
No matter what happens,

540
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,550
even if the Spirit Spring takes over this body,

541
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,710
my mortal body and Golden Core

542
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,430
will both become

543
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,690
the vessel sealing it.

544
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,820
Afterward, Zeng Yi will find him,

545
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,450
and once the entrance to the netherworld opens,

546
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,110
he will seal him back in there.

547
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,000
This matter

548
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,280
must end with me,

549
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,550
no matter what.

550
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,320
Ranran.

551
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,740
Right now,

552
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,040
my heart feels like it's breaking.

553
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,880
Master, you've planned

554
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,130
everything so well,

555
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,440
but why have you never considered my feelings?

556
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,920
My fate in this life is already sealed.

557
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,600
You shouldn't be dragged down by me.

558
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,060
What do you mean by sealed?

559
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,470
If something happens to you,

560
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,090
I'll only spend the rest of my life

561
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,240
in sadness and regret.

562
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,720
I'll never live

563
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,060
freely and happily

564
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,810
on my own

565
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,880
like you want.

566
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,400
Now,

567
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,460
I already know everything and am involved.

568
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,660
Don't even think about pushing me away.

569
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,400
Master,

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,230
I'll go to the netherworld with you

571
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,440
to seal the Spirit Spring.

572
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,590
After we seal it,

573
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,130
let's live a good life together,

574
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,860
okay?

575
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,610
Why don't you have the courage to promise me?

576
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,510
Because, even though you're fine now,

577
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,560
Master,

578
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,690
once you go to the netherworld,

579
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,550
you'll still give up your mortal body and Golden Core

580
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,410
to seal the Spirit Spring, right?

581
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,780
Is this the "sealed fate"

582
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,320
you mentioned?

583
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,870
You always carry everything on your own

584
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,800
and never want to tell me anything.

585
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
Is it because

586
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
I, Xue Ranran,

587
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,230
who don't remember the past,

588
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,940
am just being delusional

589
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
with one-sided hopes

590
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,440
and don't deserve

591
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,070
to face hardship with you

592
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,400
in your heart?

593
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,870
Of course not.

594
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,030
Ranran,

595
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,300
you've forgotten

596
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,500
what I used to be like.

597
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,600
I was ruthless and cold,

598
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,460
not kind at all.

599
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,480
I've experienced trust and hatred,

600
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,140
but in the end, all that was left was deep regret.

601
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,270
To this day, I still don't know

602
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,130
if everything Mu Qingge did for me

603
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,510
was out of love

604
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,060
or righteousness.

605
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,170
But no matter what,

606
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,600
I was the one who killed you.

607
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,840
Did you

608
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,080
truly have the intention to kill me back then?

609
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,360
I had no intention to kill you.

610
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,320
But I fell into

611
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,480
Mu Ranwu's trap,

612
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,030
helplessly watching...

613
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,350
How could someone like me

614
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,750
dare to ask for anything?

615
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,620
I hate myself more than anything.

616
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,190
Master...

617
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,070
I originally just wanted

618
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,060
to exchange my life for yours,

619
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,560
repaying what I owe you.

620
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,130
No matter how you want to take revenge on me,

621
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,530
I am willing to accept it.

622
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,090
But Mu Ranwu

623
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,900
cast a Soul-Devouring Lock on you,

624
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,430
and you forgot everything.

625
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,480
So my plan was to stay by your side first,

626
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,590
helping you rid yourself of the threat of the Soul-Devouring Lock,

627
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,960
until you became stronger

628
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,010
and could protect yourself for a lifetime.

629
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,320
Only then would I go and deal with the Spirit Spring,

630
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,050
eliminating any future risks.

631
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,530
You and I are destined to part ways.

632
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,210
I've always

633
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,840
known this in my heart.

634
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,950
But being with you day and night,

635
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,910
I couldn't help but fall for you.

636
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
You finally admitted it.

637
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,280
It's inevitable that I will return to the netherworld and seal the Spirit Spring;

638
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,610
this cannot be changed.

639
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:56,910
Ranran,

640
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,680
there will be no future between us.

641
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,180
No.

642
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,440
I don't accept that.

643
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,400
I will...

644
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,920
I must...

645
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,190
Ranran...

646
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,740
I must

647
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,640
change the ending you mentioned.

648
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,200
Master, stop moving.

649
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,380
What are you doing?

650
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,840
To trap you,

651
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,490
I've already linked the Divine Tree

652
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,890
with my spiritual power.

653
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,040
If the Divine Tree is broken,

654
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,150
my spiritual power

655
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,750
will completely dissipate.

656
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,280
You...

657
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,920
As long as your spiritual soul is restored,

658
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,070
your Golden Core will be fully repaired,

659
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,890
and you'll ascend to the Transcendence Realm.

660
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,640
That way, you won't need to sacrifice your life

661
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,100
to seal the Spirit Spring.

662
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,980
Impossible.

663
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,920
Even Liang Wumeng can't do it,

664
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,720
how could you?

665
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,790
What dangerous method will you use this time?

666
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,120
It will surely harm you,

667
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,560
and it won't succeed.

668
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,280
The Xuantian Teachings clearly state

669
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,260
that using my Formless Spirit Root

670
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,260
gives a very high chance of success.

671
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,110
Ranran, stop it!

672
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,160
Alright.

673
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,010
I promise you

674
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,960
that I will allow you to return your spiritual soul.

675
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,370
But your injuries aren't healed yet.

676
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,840
Let's wait until you've fully recovered,

677
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,440
alright?

678
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,940
It doesn't matter.

679
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,410
Master, you don't need to delay it.

680
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,070
Then what's the cost?

681
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,450
Will it harm your Formless Spirit Root

682
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,420
or your body?

683
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,230
It's not worth it at all.

684
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,000
Do you know that in my heart,

685
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,820
there's a drop of the Spirit Spring that can't be removed?

686
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,630
Even if I return safely from the netherworld,

687
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,120
I might still turn demonic in the future.

688
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,090
Do you want to repeat the same mistake?

689
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,300
Don't worry, Master.

690
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,940
It won't cost me my life.

691
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
It's just using the Formless Spirit Root

692
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,820
in exchange for you not having to die.

693
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,800
Besides, the Xuantian Teachings state

694
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,320
that after you attain the power of the Transcendence Realm,

695
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,800
you can use the Heavenly Bottle

696
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,630
to draw out that drop of the Spirit Spring in your heart

697
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,510
and seal it,

698
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,340
eliminating any future risks.

699
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,740
It's worth it in any case.

700
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,280
If you destroy your Spirit Root,

701
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,410
your spiritual power will dissipate.

702
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,590
All the suffering you endured during your past cultivation

703
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,450
will be in vain.

704
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,280
And you won't be able to cultivate again.

705
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,360
You will become more vulnerable

706
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,620
than ordinary people.

707
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,520
It's not worth it at all.

708
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,690
I revived you

709
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,760
so that in this life,

710
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,680
you could live freely for yourself.

711
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,590
I won't allow you

712
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,670
to sacrifice so much for someone

713
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,880
who once hurt and betrayed you.

714
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,000
But I want

715
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,860
to spend this life growing old...

716
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:30,800
with you.

717
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,620
Go back, Ling Xiao.

718
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,190
Thank you

719
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,850
for all these years.

720
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:35,960
Ranran.

721
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,800
Master,

722
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,300
you've ascended to the Transcendence Realm.
