00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why?

90
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why do you always make your own decisions?

91
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You don't trust me.

92
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why do you have to bear the blame for me?

93
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just because you're my master,

94
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
you can say nothing and die for me?

95
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You used your death to punish me.

96
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is this your way of being a master?

97
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Master.

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't think of ending it like this.

99
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will never be your lover.

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Even if I take the sky down,

101
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I must make you come back to life.

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will take my own debt.

103
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I will take it myself.

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I will pay you back

105
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
for what I owe you.

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Master.

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mo Qing.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Go.

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,120
Is there someone

110
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,680
who can try to help General 我在你手上

111
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
simply take the votes?

112
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,880
bastard!

113
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,720
Who can take votes against General 我?

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
She so stupid.

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not a film.

116
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
So you just stop this!

117
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,240
Nothing to do about us.

118
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,080
Luo��.

119
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,080
The Magazine has confirmed you are an agent of the Beautiful Fresco.

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Su Yishui

121
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Su Yishui

122
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Yishui

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
I've been loyal to you

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,480
but I've never saved you

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Did you and Wu Qingge

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
tell you where Lin Chen is?

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
We still have a chance to betray you

128
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Yishui

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
you're still a demon

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
As long as you agree

131
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,880
we can fight against you again

132
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
and find Lin Chen

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
and take back the world

134
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,880
You're a man of your word

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
but you don't want that

136
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
Su Yishui

137
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Su Yishui

138
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
I think the immortal in the mortal world

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,480
is getting more and more out of hand

140
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,080
You used to go to the ice-crafting forest

141
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,280
to chase away the cats and dogs

142
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
and now you're here to break into my house

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,480
Don't you want this body and body?

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm Su Yishui

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
I beg you to grant me the Transfiguration Tree

146
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
and save my master

147
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
The Transfiguration Tree is such a holy thing

148
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
It's not something you can just take

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,880
and take it as you wish

150
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
I beg you to show mercy

151
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,680
The Transfiguration Tree is right here

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
in the shadow of the light and shadow of the sky

153
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Let's see if you're still alive to take it

154
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Su Yishui

155
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Su Yishui

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Su Yishui

157
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Su Yishui

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Su Yishui

159
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Su Yishui

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Su Yishui

161
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Su Yishui

162
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Su Yishui

163
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Su Yishui

164
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Su Yishui

165
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Su Yishui

166
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Su Yishui

167
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,680
Even if you risk your life to take the Transfiguration Tree

168
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,880
you can't make up for your master's kindness

169
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,680
Everything is over

170
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
These two fruits are Master and Muran Wu

171
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,880
But why did Muran Wu have to break into the town and lose his life?

172
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,680
He was already dead

173
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,280
But the Nine-Tonged Ji Valley is under the spell

174
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
and they are both broken and mixed together

175
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,480
They can only be reborn together

176
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
When will Master come back?

177
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,080
The Transfiguration Tree is against the sky

178
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,480
It will take 18 years to return

179
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,880
You're badly injured

180
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
You need to be forced to close the coffin to keep your life

181
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
I'll help you

182
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,880
If the Ten-Death Pillar has any wind and grass

183
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
how can you protect it?

184
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,880
I have my own way

185
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,680
Why are you pulling your own soul?

186
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,880
The Transfiguration Tree absorbs the elixir

187
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,680
and needs to be hidden by the soul

188
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I can't get in and out of the coffin

189
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,280
This soul

190
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
can be kept by it

191
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,280
You even tried to scare Rong Bao?

192
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
After he is reborn

193
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
everyone will see him

194
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
After he is reborn

195
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,680
everyone will see Mu Qingge

196
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
This time

197
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,680
I will not let the world find him

198
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
Su Yishui

199
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,280
When you killed Mu Qingge

200
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
the barrier you built

201
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
was to take away his soul

202
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Why did you give up the God of War's Mirror

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,680
to take the elixir and turn Mu Qingge into a human?

204
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
To remove the curse

205
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
Mu Qingge made another curse

206
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,080
besides the Four-Face Femalemask

207
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
That is to put the life of the West Mountain disciples

208
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
together with him

209
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
He died

210
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,680
The descendants of the West Mountain will always be like this

211
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,680
There are only a few people in West Mountain

212
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
How can we let the people take risks?

213
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Mu Qingge's whereabouts are unknown after he died

214
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Don't you look for the spiritual power?

215
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,480
If you don't agree

216
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,680
I will fight with you to the death

217
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Eighteen years later

218
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,280
the real man should have the God of Heaven

219
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,880
If Mu Qingge is reborn

220
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,480
she can remove the curse for me

221
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
and also be a part of the real man

222
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,080
If I can't save her

223
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
the real man should die today

224
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,080
or be reborn after eighteen years

225
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Forget it

226
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,680
God has the virtue of life

227
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,280
I will promise you

228
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
to keep this transformation

229
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
After eighteen years, when the transformation is over

230
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,680
we will come to supervise it

231
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Even if Mu Qingge can be reborn

232
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,480
I will never give her a chance to do evil

233
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
I know you will come back

234
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
You will revenge at the back

235
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,880
We will end it together

236
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,880
How about this, together

237
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,080
we are allGreat

238
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
orous

239
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
I'll pick you up in eighteen years.

240
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
You're already in the lighthouse.

241
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Hurry and go to the secluded place.

242
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,080
There's one more thing that she's been keeping an eye on me.

243
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,080
I wanted to seal Ling Quan back into the Demon Realm,

244
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
but I only knew that

245
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
only the Demon Son of the Formation of God can do it.

246
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
I can only use up all the golden eggs

247
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
and seal the world with the source of all demons.

248
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Su Yi Shui,

249
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
if you still have any feelings for me,

250
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
then promise me one thing.

251
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
I'll definitely do it.

252
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
I'll definitely do it.

253
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I'll definitely do it.

254
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I'll definitely do it.

255
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I'll definitely do it.

256
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
It's fine.

257
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I sealed Ling Quan in the Wang Xiang Temple.

258
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Please help me return it to the You Realm.

259
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Where's Ling Quan?

260
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Master said that he sealed Ling Quan here.

261
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Why is it gone?

262
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Are you okay?

263
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
I can't feel any of the Demon Qi remaining.

264
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
It means that Ling Quan is still sealed well.

265
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
I just don't know why it was transferred to this place.

266
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You look like this.

267
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
You should just go and rest.

268
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Don't lose your life if you don't find Ling Quan.

269
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,080
How can you still protect Master when you're 18?

270
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
You still need to use half of the golden elixir and one soul to lure it

271
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
to transfer it back to the world.

272
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Do you know that...

273
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm willing to do anything.

274
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Are you willing to disobey its final order?

275
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Only the Demon Zi of the Formation Qi

276
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
can seal Ling Quan back to the You Realm.

277
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
But your body and soul are only nine points away.

278
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,080
You'll never be able to get closer to the Formation again

279
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
and revive it or not.

280
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm willing to do anything.

281
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Please grant me a method to use both power and power.

282
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
The method to use both power and power

283
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,080
is just a way to get rid of your pain.

284
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Please tell me.

285
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,080
My 12-stripped ice lotus is pure and pure.

286
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
If you can't get it back,

287
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
I'll kill you.

288
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll kill you.

289
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
I'll kill you.

290
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
I'll kill you.

291
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'll kill you.

292
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
If you can use the elixir to restore the power of the Formation,

293
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
you can then restore the power of the Demon Zi.

294
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
But if you use the elixir to enter the palace,

295
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
you'll be forced to enter the Tao.

296
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Otherwise, when the qi and qi are in a state of turmoil,

297
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
you'll be counteracted by the power of the Demon Zi.

298
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
If you're too happy and too sad,

299
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
you'll be able to break the ice lotus

300
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
and suffer the pain of being a non-human.

301
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
By then, you'll lose the power of the Demon Zi.

302
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
If you want to fulfill its order,

303
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
you'll have to use your life to seal the power of the Demon Zi.

304
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
I won't take that path.

305
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
That's best.

306
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
You must remember that in the future,

307
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
she's the new Mu Qingge.

308
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
You're also the heartless Su Yi Shui.

309
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

310
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

311
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

312
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

313
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

314
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

315
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

316
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

317
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

318
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

319
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

320
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

321
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

322
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

323
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

324
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

325
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

326
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I'll take you to the Demon Realm.

327
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
I'll take you to the demon Grandpa.

328
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I'll take you to the demon Grandpa.

329
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
I'll take you to the demon Grandpa.

330
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll take you to the demon grandpa!

331
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,200
You want to put Todosle in your stock?

332
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
Cover?

333
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,200
My master gave you F Bewegung to do the Sleep Shell Darknessaces.

334
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
That's to cover your Frac category noises.

335
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,020
To não everything has come to a standstill.

336
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,600
It happened to you last year.

337
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,040
It happened to any other disciple.

338
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,200
He's still like that.

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,360
But it happened to me.

340
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,400
He did it for his own good.

341
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,000
For the sake of the world.

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,280
For the sake of the peace and prosperity he cherishes.

343
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,440
And he's more suitable for the people of this country.

344
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,160
But he died because of me.

345
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,800
I won't owe him anything.

346
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,960
I...

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,040
How..

348
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,720
How could it be like this?

349
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,120
All forces

350
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,080
I can't go in and absorb other people's spiritual power.

351
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,640
It's just the evil magic of the other person.

352
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,000
Why does Master give you this kind of thing?

353
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Who did it?

354
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,920
Who else can it be?

355
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,120
Muran Wu.

356
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,240
I thought he was forced by Xuanwen

357
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,360
to do stupid things.

358
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
I didn't expect it to be full of tricks.

359
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,840
It seems that he just wanted to steal Mu Xing's spiritual power

360
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,640
and then he fell into the trap and lost his life.

361
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
Is he his only family?

362
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
But if he was so good to him,

363
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,360
how could he do it?

364
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,920
We'll see after he's hurt.

365
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
Let's solve the soul-chilling spell first.

366
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
Okay, I'll try.

367
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,960
What's going on?

368
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,160
I didn't expect that

369
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,560
the soul-chilling spell would turn into a body with Master.

370
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,640
It actually coincides with the spiritual platform.

371
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,640
Master's spiritual platform is unstable now.

372
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
If we unlock it rashly,

373
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm afraid he won't be able to hold on.

374
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
After three months,

375
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Muran Wu will be reborn.

376
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
Once he's alive,

377
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
he'll be able to fight with us.

378
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,800
Master will die.

379
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
Then I'll kill him.

380
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,640
No.

381
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,320
The soul-chilling spell will lock them up to death.

382
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
If he dies,

383
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
I'll be the one who will be able to save them.

384
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
We can only let Master

385
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,640
to increase his spiritual power as soon as possible

386
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,200
and stabilize the spiritual platform first.

387
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,840
We'll unlock it again in the future.

388
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,080
Fortunately, Master has his own way of taking people.

389
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
Although my spiritual root has been taken,

390
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,160
it's still not broken.

391
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,080
After the essence of life and death is reborn,

392
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
it becomes an infinite spiritual root.

393
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,440
What are you going to do?

394
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm going to kill him.

395
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm going to kill him.

396
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,360
I'm going to kill him.

397
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm going to kill him.

398
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
What are you going to do?

399
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,200
If it weren't for you, the traitor,

400
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,800
how could I have been able to escape?

401
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,200
Master can't stay here.

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm going to take him back to my Chaming Mountain.

403
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,320
How dare you!

404
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,840
I took my master away.

405
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,920
Why are you stopping me?

406
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
What's the use of keeping Master?

407
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,120
When Master remembers everything in the future,

408
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,720
you'll feel sorry for his damage and betrayal.

409
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,320
Do you think he'll forgive you?

410
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,720
No matter how he punishes you in the future,

411
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
you owe him those blood debts.

412
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,040
You can only bear it yourself.

413
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,400
So what if I don't forgive him?

414
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,920
I'll just pay him back with my life.

415
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,720
If he wants to kill me and clear the door,

416
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,920
I'll cut him off.

417
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,880
If he doesn't see me again,

418
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
I'll do everything I can to help him escape.

419
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,080
I swore that

420
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,640
I would protect him.

421
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,240
I won't hurt anyone,

422
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
including myself.

423
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,640
Besides,

424
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,040
I still have some questions that I haven't solved.

425
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,760
Before the Xuan Men were surrounded,

426
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
he was seriously injured.

427
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Who hurt him?

428
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,360
And that time,

429
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,040
if he wants to take Lin Quan away,

430
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
there's no way to suppress him.

431
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:21,840
Why did he hide in the

432
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
village?

433
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,120
I!

434
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,240
Go on with your training

435
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,960
to fulfill my quest.

436
00:26:50,500 --> 00:27:03,600
King都 voy a considerably

437
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,260
this way

438
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,460
Easy

439
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:14,980
And easy

440
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,820
easier

441
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,700
Lesson

442
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,600
Come on

443
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,180
Learn

444
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
What?

445
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,380
I'm your senior,

446
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
I can't say anything to you.

447
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,180
What's your attitude?

448
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,180
You're obviously not good to your senior.

449
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,580
Do you want him to run away?

450
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,380
You're so awkward,

451
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
you can't figure it out.

452
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380
Why are you questioning him?

453
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
I misunderstood you.

454
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,780
Master never does that.

455
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Actually,

456
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,580
everything is under master's control.

457
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
You're not the one who's wrong.

458
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
You're the one who's wrong.

459
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
You're the one who's wrong.

460
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
You're the one who's wrong.

461
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
You're the one who's wrong.

462
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
I'm not hurt.

463
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,380
Really?

464
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,980
Master always transfers his cultivation

465
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,580
to him through magic.

466
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,780
But he never says it.

467
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,980
You don't have to argue with him.

468
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
I...

469
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,500
Look at him.

470
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Look at his face.

471
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,300
He looks so angry.

472
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,260
I really don't know how you and Yuchen

473
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,820
have been able to hold back your laughter for so many years.

474
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,340
You're awake.

475
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,340
Ask me anything.

476
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,380
Why did I become like that after I went down the mountain?

477
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,780
You're too weak.

478
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,940
You're not even stable enough to be the spiritual platform

479
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
that you were born to be.

480
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,260
That's why you're in danger.

481
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,700
So,

482
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,700
your master helped you to get this fairy tree branch

483
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,420
to connect with your spiritual platform

484
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,420
and provide you with immortal power.

485
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,940
If it's too far away from the branch,

486
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,020
your spiritual power will be depleted

487
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,940
and you'll be in danger of death.

488
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,740
I kept you on the mountain to help you to protect your spiritual platform.

489
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
I was wrong.

491
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
I was wrong.

492
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
I was wrong.

493
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,540
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,620
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,500
Don't be afraid.

500
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,180
I'm your...

501
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,660
Uncle Dorgon.

502
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,860
My surname is Zeng, I'm from Ming Yi.

503
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,900
With me on this mountain,

504
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,740
nobody can bully you.

505
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,660
Uncle Dorgon?

506
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,840
Master

507
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry

508
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,880
What are you looking at?

509
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,540
No big thunder

510
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,040
The weather today...

511
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
It's nice

512
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
I'm sorry.

513
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,560
I see.

514
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

515
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
How could I have thought that you were so ridiculous

516
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,160
and thought I was going to eat you?

517
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,480
That's your problem.

518
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,640
You always kill the evil spirits.

519
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,400
You scared Ran Ran away.

520
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,720
I was wrong to make a mistake before.

521
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,080
But I still don't understand.

522
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,680
You met me in person.

523
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Why did you take care of me like this?

524
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,880
He owes others.

525
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,640
He should do that.

526
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,400
Owe others?

527
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
Could it be my parents?

528
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,680
No.

529
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,000
Then who is it?

530
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,000
Could it be your friend?

531
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,320
No.

532
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
I understand.

533
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
In that case,

534
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,400
thank you for your care and care for me.

535
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,080
You want to stay?

536
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Since I can only live by staying in the West Mountain,

537
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
I'll just practice.

538
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,280
Although I didn't do my best today,

539
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
but you saved me many times.

540
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,480
I believe that he won't harm me.

541
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,680
When he's willing to say it,

542
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,080
he can tell me later.

543
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm not going to eat it.

544
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,480
I'm going to eat it.

545
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm going to eat it.

546
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,880
I'm going to eat it.

547
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
I'm going to eat it.

548
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,280
I'm going to eat it.

549
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,480
Take it with you in the future

550
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,080
in case of an accident.

551
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,880
Although the magic is good,

552
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,280
there will always be a day when the spiritual power is depleted.

553
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,680
If you want to save your life,

554
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,280
you still have to practice hard.

555
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
I understand.

556
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
By the way,

557
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,080
I have one thing to confess.

558
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,280
I had my own plan when I went up the mountain.

559
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,480
I want to save my friend.

560
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Your friend?

561
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,880
He's a spirit of Yi Lv.

562
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,080
He died too soon after leaving his master.

563
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
It's said that only Lian Wu Meng

564
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
can save him with the blood jade powder.

565
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,480
So,

566
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
I took Master's blood jade powder.

567
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
You risked your life for this thing?

568
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,280
You don't believe in fate?

569
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
I don't believe in fate.

570
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,480
What are you doing?

571
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,880
Pay attention to your attitude.

572
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,480
Ran Ran is just fine.

573
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
Since I have memories,

574
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,080
Ling Xiao has been protecting me.

575
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,480
He is my most important friend.

576
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,280
I can't just die.

577
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,680
So, Ran Ran went down the mountain

578
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
to save this spirit of mountain.

579
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,680
It's a bad luck.

580
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,280
When I find Lian Wu Meng and save Ling Xiao,

581
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,480
I will be ashamed.

582
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
As for Master's blood jade powder,

583
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
I will find a new one for you.

584
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,080
Is that okay?

585
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,480
This is the place where the immortal master Lian Wu Meng lives?

586
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Yes.

587
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Sorry.

588
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Master is now in seclusion.

589
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
He can't be seen.

590
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
When can he be released?

591
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,480
Master's power is growing.

592
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
It's a critical moment.

593
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
It will take two years.

594
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
It will be a short year.

595
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,080
Everything will be ruined.

596
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,480
One or two years?

597
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
But can he still survive until then?

598
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,280
If there is more blood jade powder

599
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,280
to nourish the spirit of mountain,

600
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
maybe he can be released.

601
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Blood jade powder is the rarest spiritual treasure in the world.

602
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
It's not easy to find a piece of it.

603
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Where can I get more blood jade powder?

604
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
The key to the nourishment of the spirit of mountain

605
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,680
is that it can merge with the five-form spirit.

606
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
But...

607
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,880
In fact, the Immortal Cultivation Sword

608
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,680
has a rare and rare

609
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,680
five-form spirit root.

610
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,680
It can absorb the five-form spirit root,

611
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,080
and can be used to cultivate medicine.

612
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,480
It can nourish the spirit of mountain more than blood jade powder.

613
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,480
The five-form spirit root is so powerful.

614
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,880
It can nourish the spirit of mountain?

615
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,280
But...

616
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,280
But the blood jade water is hard to find.

617
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,880
The five-form spirit root is more rare.

618
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Good luck to you.

619
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,880
Goodbye.

620
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,680
Master, Ling Xiao is saved.

621
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,480
You're so brave.

622
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,080
I didn't expect your five-form spirit root

623
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,680
can also nourish the spirit of mountain.

624
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
I've made Ling Xiao

625
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
connect with your five-form spirit root.

626
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
You can use the spirit root to nourish and replenish it.

627
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,280
Even if I can't find the soul master,

628
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,280
it's fine.

629
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,880
If you want it to recover,

630
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
you need to improve your cultivation.

631
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,480
After Liang Wu Meng is out of the light,

632
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,080
you need to cultivate first.

633
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,680
But remember,

634
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,280
you can't let others know your five-form spirit root.

635
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,880
I'll cultivate seriously.

636
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,480
Whether it's being roasted on a hunting day,

637
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,480
being soaked in ice water,

638
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
or having a stomachache,

639
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,280
I'll treat you seriously.

640
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,280
How can I do that?

641
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
How can I let master...

642
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Why are you so cruel as a master?

643
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,680
The training method is too extreme.

644
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
Didn't the master teach me that way?

645
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,080
Nonsense.

646
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Master has never tortured you.

647
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,280
You're too arrogant.

648
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,680
Master had to do that to make you a master.

649
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,080
You dare to say that he didn't teach you

650
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,880
with enough care and efficiency?

651
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm telling you,

652
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,480
being a master is not easy.

653
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
You need to pay attention to the method.

654
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
It's far from that.

655
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,880
Think about it.

656
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,480
It seems that the relationship between master and master

657
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,480
is not like the legend of the outside world.

658
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
It's like a quarrel.

659
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,680
So,

660
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,080
your teaching of Ran Ran

661
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,480
should be followed by the order of our West Mountain.

662
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,280
A master should be a master.

663
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,280
A master should be a master.

664
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,080
There's a master who can be a master?

665
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,080
Of course.

666
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,680
As long as you don't break the rules in the West Mountain,

667
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,080
no one can control you.

668
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Really?

669
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,480
As long as you can complete the homework,

670
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,880
I'll let you do the rest.

671
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Thank you, master.

672
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
I promise I won't be lazy.

673
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,080
But I just want to be able to protect myself

674
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
and my friends.

675
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
As for the ability to become a god,

676
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm not interested in that.

677
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,480
I prefer the lively life of a master.

678
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,480
Is that okay?

679
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,480
Great.

680
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,080
I'll go and cook something delicious.

681
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,080
I'll also give master a taste of my cooking.

682
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,680
You're already in this condition.

683
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,080
You still want to eat?

684
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Even if it's the last day of life,

685
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
you should eat well and drink well.

686
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
I, Xue Ran Ran,

687
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
always believe in

688
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
being a low-key person and eating high-key.

689
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,080
Only in this way can I live my life.

690
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,680
If you don't want to be a master,

691
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,880
you can't live your life.

692
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Master, what do you think?

693
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I'll let you be.

694
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,480
But I've already stopped eating.

695
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
I'm not interested in these worldly things.

696
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Don't count me in.

697
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,880
If he doesn't eat, I won't say I won't eat.

698
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,880
He's the most annoying person.

699
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Don't mind him.

700
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Master,

701
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,280
we really look forward to meeting.

702
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,280
What do you mean?

703
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,680
No, no.

704
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,480
Then I'll go and cook.

705
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,280
After Liang O Meng comes out of jail,

706
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Ran Ran will remember everything.

707
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Your spiritual soul

708
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,480
will probably not come back.

709
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,480
That's just an excuse to ask him to practice martial arts.

710
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,880
I didn't expect him to return it.

711
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,880
But if you lack this spirit,

712
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,680
you can't repair the elixir.

713
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
From then on, you will have no connection with the phantom mirror.

714
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,880
You can only rely on the ice palace to maintain your power.

715
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,280
Is it really a pity?

716
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,740
and the power of the

717
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,400
Xuanran Sect.

718
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,340
Su Yishui

719
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,540
has successfully brought back Xuanran.

720
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,700
Wei Jiu is still unwilling to give up

721
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,540
and sent his disciples to search everywhere.

722
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,540
It seems that he will not give up easily.

723
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,040
As you expected,

724
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,640
only Xue Ranran can stir up this storm.

725
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,340
It won't be too far away from the day we wait.

726
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,140
Ranran,

727
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,340
I didn't expect you to come back from the mountain

728
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,140
and ask me to thank you.

729
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,380
You're still laughing.

730
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,740
Listen,

731
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,980
it's okay if you're half-dead and half-dead.

732
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,140
But don't drag us into this.

733
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,940
Then,

734
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,620
stop laughing.

735
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,380
Quickly.

736
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,300
Hurry up.

737
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,300
Hurry up.

738
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,140
Hurry up.

739
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:19,980
Hurry up.

740
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,500
Hurry up.

741
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,140
Wait for me.

742
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,940
85% of the village-age Monk Night P smoke.

743
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,780
Yishui said that

744
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
it's right that I was wrong.

745
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,680
I'm the best and

746
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,780
apologise to everyone.

747
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,600
Eating is designed to enlarge the wisdom of a man.

748
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,140
It's unwidely useful to think of yourself.

749
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,240
This is the final edict of our Xishan Kaishan

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,360
Yes, uncle

751
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Little sister

752
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,000
You are a golden soft armor that can't be cut

753
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
Thank you for your gift, uncle Zeng

754
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,360
Thank you, uncle

755
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,120
Thank you, uncle

756
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
It's nothing

757
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,800
You are welcome

758
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,480
Sit down

759
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,880
Sit down, come

760
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,720
Sit down, sit down, sit down

761
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,920
I finally see uncle Zeng today

762
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,880
Your hands are like a golden soft armor

763
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,880
That's the past

764
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,120
It's different from the past

765
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,240
It is said that uncle's hands

766
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,440
Because of the involvement of the master

767
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,360
I was hurt

768
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,560
Is this true

769
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,760
This is a rumor

770
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,320
Rumor is rumored

771
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,160
It's not to be smelled, right

772
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,520
The demoness is dead

773
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,640
Xishan is gone

774
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,240
What are you still insisting on?

775
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,080
How about changing our Qingcheng Pan

776
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,640
There is still a B

777
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,400
It's nice to say

778
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,280
Isn't it just trying to take me away to do spiritual devices?

779
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,520
I will never betray Xishan

780
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Will not betray my master

781
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,360
it is good

782
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Since your hands don't want to use it for us

783
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,680
Don't want to take advantage of other options

784
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,960
Later, it's a pity that your master

785
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,320
I came to save me in time

786
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,800
It's over, it's over

787
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,920
Hurry up, the food is cold

788
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,400
Hurry up and eat

789
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,240
Try the craftsmanship of Ranran

790
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,360
Uncle

791
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,600
The master specially asked me to go down the mountain

792
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,560
To buy the Chen Niang

793
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm afraid you are not enough

794
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,640
I brought it to you

795
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,640
Yutong, you are here

796
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,560
Sit down together

797
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,760
Try Ranran's craftsmanship

798
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,520
Come on, come on, come on

799
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,480
Sit down and eat together

800
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,760
Hurry up and sit down, sit down, sit down

801
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,760
Take everyone together

802
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
So fragrant

803
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,360
I haven't smelled it in the mountains for a long time

804
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,520
Such a fragrant cabbage

805
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,360
Why don't you ask Uncle Yuchen to come together?

806
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,240
No need

807
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,040
My brother has always put the master's face

808
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,840
As a sample

809
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,760
The master is a B

810
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
He can't eat either

811
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,440
Look at you

812
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,440
Look at you, Yuchen

813
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,320
Who is not good at learning

814
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,440
I have to learn that Su Mutong

815
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Wasted Ranran

816
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,720
This is not a good idea

817
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,400
right

818
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,360
No matter what

819
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,160
This is our coffee

820
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,560
it is good

821
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,880
Everyone, try my craftsmanship

822
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,840
I will try it

823
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,320
White stuffing

824
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,600
Really delicious

825
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,280
I thought you would come back to life

826
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,800
Will immediately take back everything

827
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,800
From now on, the grudge is all over

828
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,480
did not expect

829
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,120
There will be such a chance to get along

830
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,320
When you know the truth

831
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,840
Will you still be like you said

832
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,560
Never see each other again

833
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,160
I have another good dish

834
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,280
Wait for me, wait for me

835
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,560
Enough enough

836
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,480
Master looks so lonely

837
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I am here

838
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I am here

839
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800

I am here

842

I am here

843
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
I am here

844

I am here

852

I am here

853
