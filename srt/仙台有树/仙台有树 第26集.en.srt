[Love of the Divine Tree]

00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,950
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Then I wouldn't have pushed you

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,070
to Su Yishui.

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,509
But in the end,

6
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,789
what did I get?

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,560
What I got was the poison

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,560
secretly sent by my second brother.

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,430
What I got was

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,000
this body that is forever in pain,

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
a gift from him in his fight

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,910
to become the Crown Prince.

13
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,000
The poison in your body

14
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,740
was your brother's doing?

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,910
I was too naive back then.

16
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,260
I've realized that in an imperial family,

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,220
nothing else matters,

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,240
except for the throne.

19
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,280
Unfortunately, I realized it too late.

20
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,520
Killing that

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,030
ingrate

22
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,030
couldn't change the fact

23
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,560
that the poison had spread through my organs.

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,430
As a result,

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,800
I have no choice

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
but to find another body.

27
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,230
I'm forced into this.

28
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,190
I truly regret my choice back then.

29
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,190
But now that

30
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,960
I have a chance to survive,

31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,630
there's no way

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
I'll settle for

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,450
the current situation.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,840
No matter what the cost,

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,660
I must change everything.

36
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,150
Let's find another way together,

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,710
okay?

38
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,090
I'm quite skilled in alchemy,

39
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,000
and in the universe,

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
there are many people with special skills.

41
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,190
But Ranran,

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,560
what I want

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,590
has never been any elixir

44
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,160
or some extra years

45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,650
of struggling to survive.

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,000
What I want is immortality!

47
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,490
I will stop you.

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,190
Why?

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,030
Back then, you said the Heavenly Ones

50
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,470
did not interfere in court affairs,

51
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,150
but you still

52
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,750
put all that aside to help me.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,070
Why can't youâ€¦

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,370
do that again this time?

55
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,120
I don't need you to step in.

56
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,550
I just want you to stand by my side.

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
That's enough.

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,200
Why did you bring me here?

59
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,400
I've set up a formation in the Eastern Palace,

60
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,630
especially over this Inquiry Pond.

61
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,680
Whether you're willing to help me or not,

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
no one can stop me

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,530
from doing what I'm going to do.

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Not even

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Su Yishui, who prides himself

66
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,450
on his powerful magic.

67
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,350
That's why you sealed off the Inquiry Pond?

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,430
Su Yishui came to me himself.

69
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,680
I was truly delighted.

70
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,390
Originally, Feng

71
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,270
planned to use the Four-Way Waterways

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,120
to gather spiritual energy

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,210
and refine the Green Dragon to extend my life.

74
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,830
But the earthquake caused the waterways to collapse,

75
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,870
which led me to discover

76
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,070
that those waterways

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
were filled with malicious energy.

78
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,190
Compared to spiritual energy,

79
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,590
it can refine the Green Dragon much faster.

80
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,000
As luck would have it,

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,510
I met you in Puxin Village.

82
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
That's when I learned

83
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,160
that the malicious energy in those waterways

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,960
all came from the Spirit Spring.

85
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,010
The Spirit Springâ€¦

86
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,810
The Spirit Spring?

87
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,430
He just passed out.

88
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,380
The matter of the Spirit Spring

89
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,180
must not be known by more people.

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,640
So you were pretending.

91
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,970
I really underestimated you.

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
Otherwise,

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
how could I have heard

94
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
your conversation with Meng Zhang?

95
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,630
It confirmed for me that

96
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,430
the Seven Evil Transformation Spell truly works.

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,310
Not only can it

98
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,159
merge two bodies into one,

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,180
but it can also guide a soul

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,520
to permanently reside in someone else's body.

101
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,360
So from that moment on,

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,800
you were set

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
on your body-swapping plan.

104
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,270
But I never expected

105
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,390
the malicious energy to grow stronger,

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,050
making the Green Dragon in the pond aggressive.

107
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,680
I didn't want it

108
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
to harm the people in the city,

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,830
so I used a large number of

110
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,230
cultivators' Golden Cores to suppress it.

111
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,070
Because of that,

112
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,570
I started

113
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,330
having doubts about integrating

114
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,590
with the Green Dragon.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,750
After all, dragons are hard to tame.

116
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,950
If I failed to overpower the dragon's spirit

117
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,390
and was consumed by its nature,

118
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,630
I'd be in trouble.

119
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,159
But just at that moment,

120
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,190
I learned that Su Yishui,

121
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,920
at the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

122
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,750
used the Soul Control Technique

123
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,480
to possess the White Tiger.

124
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,360
You...

125
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,600
I also happened to know

126
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,400
that he once made a soul oath

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
to help Meng Zhang

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
find the lost dragon egg

129
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,680
and return it to Dragon Island.

130
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,920
So I knew

131
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,390
Su Yishui would definitely come to save the Green Dragon

132
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,510
and use his Soul Control Technique

133
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,110
to possess the Green Dragon.

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,650
That way,

135
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,390
he'd leave his body behind.

136
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
His body would be empty,

137
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,800
but it's powerful enough

138
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,530
to withstand a body snatching.

139
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,430
Tell me,

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,360
isn't this a heaven-sent opportunity?

141
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,150
After all, in this world,

142
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,070
Su Yishui is the best option

143
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,720
for my body-snatching plan.

144
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,560
He's my cousin, after all.

145
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,920
Since childhood,

146
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,990
we've looked somewhat similar.

147
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,870
Switching bodies with him

148
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
will make it easier to explain

149
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,169
appearance changes in the future.

150
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,909
And as a bonus,

151
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll gain all his spiritual power.

152
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,049
Despicable!

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Now, everything

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,630
is under my control.

155
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,510
Whatever I want,

156
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,270
I will have!

157
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,630
Ranran.

158
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,510
The 7th of this month is an auspicious day.

159
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
Once I

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,870
take over Su Yishui's body,

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,860
I'll come to marry you,

162
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,840
okay?

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,720
By then,

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,960
you can stay

165
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
by my side with the affection

166
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,600
for both of us.

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,790
Su Yu, are you insane?

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,750
I will never marry you!

169
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
After you become my Crown Princess,

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll do everything you wish.

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
But now,

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,200
you have no say in this.

173
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,910
Guards!

174
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes!

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
Escort Miss Ranran

176
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,820
to the Cool Breeze Palace.

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,270
She'll stay there until she agrees to marry me!

178
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes!

179
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,890
[Cool Breeze Palace, Eastern Palace]

180
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,910
Master needs to suppress the Green Dragon's malicious energy.

181
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,720
Only on the Double Ninth Festival

182
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
can he lead it out of the Inquiry Pond,

183
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,510
ensuring it won't

184
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,170
endanger the entire capital.

185
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,600
But before that, Su Yu

186
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
plans to seize his body.

187
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,520
Today is already the 4th.

188
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,150
Master still doesn't know

189
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,510
about Su Yu's plan.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
I must find a way

191
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,790
to get out of here

192
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,640
and stop all of this.

193
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,290
If you want to go out for a walk,

194
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
just send someone to let me know.

195
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,100
No matter how busy I am,

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,330
I'll always have time for you.

197
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,360
Ranran, look,

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,860
this is the wedding dress I prepared for you.

199
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
And this pearlâ€”

200
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,030
do you still remember it?

201
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,190
Back then, when I was falsely accused in court,

202
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,590
I was depressed for days.

203
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,480
To cheer me up,

204
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,360
you took me to the seaside to collect pearl oysters,

205
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,630
and we found this one.

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,030
At the time, you joked

207
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,610
that since I found this pearl myself,

208
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,790
it was the only one in the vast ocean,

209
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,080
and one day,

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,010
I should give it to my bride.

211
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,150
I've always remembered your words.

212
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,750
But you don't know

213
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,360
that since that day,

214
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,300
the one I want to give this pearl to

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,210
has always been you.

216
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,240
I don't remember

217
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
any of that.

218
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,750
And this pearl

219
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,890
doesn't suit me.

220
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,760
It's alright.

221
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,610
All those memories from the pastâ€”

222
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
once we're married,

223
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,570
I'll have plenty of time

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,980
to tell you about them.

225
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,510
Su Yu,

226
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,550
did you even listen

227
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,370
to what I said?

228
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,240
Let me go.

229
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
Don't harm my master,

230
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,750
and don't hurt those

231
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,750
innocent people.

232
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,840
Maybe then, in the future,

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,300
we could still be friends.

234
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
I'll definitely find a wayâ€¦

235
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,840
You should know

236
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
that I never wanted

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,860
to just be your friend!

238
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,510
Alright.

239
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,440
No more talking.

240
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,720
Since last night,

241
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,370
you haven't eaten anything, have you?

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,790
Sit down.

243
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,670
Eat with me.

244
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
I need to eat to have the strength to escape.

245
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,520
Since you passed away over a decade ago,

246
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,910
no one has

247
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,640
shared a meal with me like this.

248
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,270
This braised lamb

249
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
and these taro ribsâ€”

250
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,600
I made them myself

251
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
this morning.

252
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
They were both

253
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,500
your favorite dishes.

254
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,080
You taught me how to make them.

255
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,090
Over the years, whenever I felt lonely

256
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,050
or missed you,

257
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,340
I'd cook these dishes.

258
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,150
Come on, eat up.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,150
Try these taro ribs.

260
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,670
Do they taste like the ones you used to make?

261
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,790
I don't like

262
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,630
these dishes anymore.

263
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,810
Go bring

264
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,770
the chef in the kitchen today here.

265
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,390
Greetings, Your Highness.

266
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,150
The Crown Princess

267
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,330
loves the dishes you made.

268
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,670
Thank you for your praise, Your Highness.

269
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,960
The food I made

270
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,910
being likedâ€¦

271
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,300
being liked by the Crown Princess

272
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,200
is my greatest honor.

273
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,320
Indeed.

274
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,790
She likes them so much

275
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,140
that she completely ignored

276
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,800
the dishes I personally made.

277
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,550
How do you think

278
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
I should reward you?

279
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
My apologies.

280
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,440
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

281
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,910
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

282
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,630
Guards!

283
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,550
Take him away.

284
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Beat him to death!

285
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,550
Yes!

286
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,480
Spare me, Your Highness!

287
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,510
Have mercy, Your Highness!

288
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,240
Stop!

289
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,790
Su Yu, are you crazy?

290
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,720
From now on,

291
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,860
you can only like the food I make for you.

292
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,320
You can only like the things I give you.

293
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,450
You can only like me!

294
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,200
If you

295
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
still long for anything else,

296
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,000
then I'll make it allâ€¦

297
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,200
disappear.

298
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,920
Take him away!

299
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,030
I'll eat now!

300
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,720
Let him go.

301
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,040
That's more like it.

302
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,840
T-Thank you for your mercy, Your Highness.

303
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
Thank you for your mercy.

304
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,160
You may leave.

305
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,920
Yes, yes.

306
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,630
Sit.

307
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,200
Sit!

308
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,870
If you like anything,

309
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
just tell me.

310
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll get it for you.

311
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,150
Oh, right.

312
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,240
I told you before

313
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,670
that I'd take you to see the red leaves

314
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,320
and to try

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,510
the best Eight-Treasure Duck in the capital.

316
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,710
I haven't forgotten.

317
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll do them with you

318
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,320
to make up for

319
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
the regrets of the past 18 years.

320
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,600
Do you have any medicine on you?

321
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,820
So you still care about me.

322
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
You're worried about me,

323
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,500
aren't you?

324
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,310
I care about you

325
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,510
because I still remember

326
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,160
the Young Master Yu who once

327
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,359
helped me at the foot of Mount Absolute.

328
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,369
I know this isn't who you truly are.

329
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Please, be the person you used to be.

330
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,180
The person I used to be?

331
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,400
I've long become

332
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,680
who I am now.

333
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,790
If I were to turn back now,

334
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,790
I'd surely die without a resting place.

335
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,720
So now,

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,980
I have no choice but to walk down this path

337
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
until I

338
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,880
reach the very top!

339
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,040
[Outside the Imperial City]

340
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
The imperial palace is heavily guarded.

341
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,110
The barrier surrounding it

342
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,880
is impenetrable.

343
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,270
Even sound transmission talismans can't get through.

344
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,550
I wonder how Ranran and Master

345
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,720
are doing.

346
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,230
More gifts again.

347
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,550
Gold,

348
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,880
wood,

349
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,480
water,

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,590
fire,

351
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,110
and earth.

352
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,350
Got it!

353
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,070
With all five elements,

354
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
I can use them to strengthen

355
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,550
the power of my talismans.

356
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,590
I remember part of the Soul Control Technique

357
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,830
Master used.

358
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,640
If I modify the puppet talisman

359
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,700
based on the Soul Control Technique,

360
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,820
it should work.

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,310
It worked!

362
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,390
Hey, I'm so hungry.

363
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,550
I'm starving.

364
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,110
Bring me some food!

365
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,510
Miss,

366
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,790
your food is here.

367
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,270
It's only a 30-minute walk,

368
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,000
but it actually took me so long.

369
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,200
If I had known,

370
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
I'd have made the wooden puppet's legs

371
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,200
a bit longer.

372
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,880
Xue Ranran.

373
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,030
Master,

374
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,310
you figured out so quickly

375
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,970
that the wooden puppet was me.

376
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,240
Who taught you the Soul Control Technique?

377
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,030
Separating the spiritual soul from the body consumes immense energy.

378
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,750
A single mistake, and it could backfire,

379
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,960
leaving you severely injured.

380
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,110
You're so reckless.

381
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,210
If it's so harmful to the body,

382
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,570
then what about you?

383
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,590
You haven't fully recovered from your last injury,

384
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,750
yet you still used the Soul Control Technique

385
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,310
to possess the Green Dragon.

386
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,910
Does your safety not matter?

387
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,830
It's different.

388
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,760
I'm your master.

389
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,110
You're not allowed to do

390
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,110
something so dangerous again.

391
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,840
Understood?

392
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Who's the master is still up for debate.

393
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,200
Shui,

394
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,310
promise me

395
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,500
you won't take risks alone

396
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,350
or use this dangerous technique again.

397
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,070
Got it?

398
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,040
Alright.

399
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
I have something important to tell you.

400
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,350
It's all my fault

401
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,350
that Su Yu

402
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,750
took your body.

403
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,030
What he wants now

404
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,750
is not the Green Dragon's body,

405
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,270
but yours.

406
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,720
I knew Su Yu lured me to the capital

407
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,250
with some ulterior motive,

408
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,380
but I never expected this

409
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,440
to be his true goal.

410
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,240
Clever plan.

411
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,790
Do you have any way

412
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,890
to get out of here

413
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,440
and return to your body?

414
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,160
Su Yu and his men can't get to the bottom of the pond,

415
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,830
so they placed a strong spell seal

416
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,400
on the pond and the Green Dragon.

417
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,030
My spiritual power

418
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,310
is greatly suppressed now.

419
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,920
Unless I ride the dragon out of the Inquiry Pond,

420
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,640
my primordial spirit

421
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,350
will remain trapped by its side,

422
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,200
unable to escape.

423
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,510
Then what should we do?

424
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,960
Su Yu is planning to seize your body on the 7th.

425
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,920
We can't wait until the 9th.

426
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,370
If that's the case,

427
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I have to forcefully control the dragon

428
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,750
and break out ahead of time.

429
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,270
No!

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,310
If you leave the Inquiry Pond without accumulating

431
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,400
enough spiritual power,

432
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,510
your spiritual soul in the Green Dragon

433
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,640
will suffer a backlash from its malicious energy.

434
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
You're still injured.

435
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,970
We can't take that risk.

436
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,110
Let me find a way

437
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,920
to stall him for another two days.

438
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
What's your plan?

439
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,790
I actually have the perfect excuse.

440
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,260
Since Su Yu wants me to marry him,

441
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,000
then I'll agree.

442
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
But the wedding date

443
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
needs to be decided by me.

444
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,590
What?

445
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,410
This way, we can not only buy more time

446
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,440
but also make the guards

447
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,500
lower their guard.

448
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,920
That will give me a chance

449
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,510
to sneak out and find

450
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,960
the core of the formation in the Eastern Palace.

451
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,620
Otherwise,

452
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,790
even if you break out of the Inquiry Pond,

453
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,830
the barrier around the Eastern Palace

454
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,160
will still be a problem.

455
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,240
Su Yu took advantage of the situation

456
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
to force you into marriage,

457
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
and you actually agreed?

458
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,690
It's just a temporary measure.

459
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,030
Still not acceptable!

460
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,960
Stay out of it.

461
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,720
I'll find a way to reclaim my body

462
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,070
and break the formation myself.

463
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,680
You absolutely cannot marry Su Yu.

464
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I'll say it againâ€”

465
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,720
you absolutely cannot marry Su Yu!

466
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,860
But Master, you're trapped here.

467
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
How can you break the formation?

468
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
Master,

469
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,310
you're so angry.

470
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,070
Are you jealous?

471
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,510
Xue Ranran,

472
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,920
do you want to be punished

473
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,050
in Westerly Valley?

474
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,960
This is an order from your master.

475
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,890
If you dare...

476
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,550
Looks like I guessed right.

477
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,590
Shui,

478
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,330
you've got some nerve.

479
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,960
Not only did you dare to be your master's master,

480
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,090
but you also have your heart set on her.

481
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,680
What a rebellious disciple.

482
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,640
Xue Ranran!

483
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,320
Don't worry.

484
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,200
I won't actually marry Su Yu.

485
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,310
Butâ€¦

486
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,460
since you're already

487
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,050
so rebellious,

488
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,310
why don't you

489
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,070
marry me on that day?

490
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,290
Stop talking nonsense.

491
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,830
Alright.

492
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,590
We'll

493
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,920
discuss that later.

494
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,010
Back to the main issue.

495
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,290
I can see that much of the Green Dragon's

496
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,350
malicious energy has been purified.

497
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,610
What about "The Xuantian Teachings"?

498
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,890
This is "The Xuantian Teachings."

499
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,400
I've already read it.

500
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,830
Aside from records about

501
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,240
the founding of Celestial Sect,

502
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,510
it only contains mortal techniques

503
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,240
like the Seven Evil Transformation Spell.

504
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,440
There's no mention of the netherworld.

505
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,080
Nor any method for returning the spiritual soul.

506
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
But if this scroll

507
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,750
is capable of suppressing the Green Dragon,

508
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,790
it can't be fake.

509
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,400
Could it be

510
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,550
that there's some secret to opening it?

511
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,150
I've tried various methods,

512
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,040
but nothing has changed.

513
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,570
Unless there's another explanation:

514
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,290
"The Xuantian Teachings" has another half.

515
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,470
Now that I think about it,

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,550
the empty box I found back then

517
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,030
did seem large enough

518
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,160
to hold two scrolls.

519
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,910
So what you're saying is,

520
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,230
only when both halves

521
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,270
are combined

522
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,720
will the true

523
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,580
Xuantian Teachings be revealed?

524
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,200
Exactly.

525
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,480
Since no one has ever mentioned

526
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,350
that "The Xuantian Teachings" has two volumes,

527
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,150
the other half must be disguised

528
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,640
in some way.

529
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,790
Su Yu probably hasn't realized this either,

530
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,510
so he mixed it in

531
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,660
with your past life's old books

532
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,120
and stored it in the study.

533
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,270
But

534
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
since there are two volumes,

535
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,590
they must share something in common.

536
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,200
Master,

537
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
think back.

538
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,540
When you found that empty box,

539
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,310
was there

540
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,810
anything special nearby?

541
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,800
The material of the scroll.

542
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,070
At that time, I came across a scroll

543
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,200
called "The Path of Immortality."

544
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
Its material

545
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,130
is the same

546
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,020
as this scroll.

547
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,160
It looks like

548
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,750
ordinary brocade,

549
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,350
but it actually

550
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,350
contains the rare

551
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,720
Red-Tailed Fire Mouse Fur.

552
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,650
It's fireproof.

553
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,120
Red-Tailed Fire Mouse Fur?

554
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
That's very rare,

555
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,040
so it can't be a coincidence.

556
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,270
I'll go find that scroll right away.

557
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Act within your limits.

558
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,860
Don't force it.

559
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,720
And especially, don't use yourself as a bargaining chip

560
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
by agreeing to marryâ€¦

561
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,440
Master, what are you saying?

562
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,220
My spiritual power is unstable.

563
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,070
I can't hear you.

564
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,750
Xue Ranran!

565
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,750
Master,

566
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,830
I really can't hold on any longer.

567
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,610
The Divine Tree's leaves are connected.

568
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,750
They can act as a link between us.

569
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,950
Wait for my good news.

570
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,660
Be careful!

571
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,690
This is the empty box

572
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,440
where Master

573
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,300
found "The Xuantian Teachings."

574
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,680
It's here.

575
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,850
As expected, nothing looks out of place.

576
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
It's all just the Heavenly One's teachings

577
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,700
on spiritual training and cultivation.

578
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,720
There must be some key

579
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,370
to reveal the true content

580
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,650
of both scrolls.

581
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,830
I knew it!

582
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,200
Oh no.

583
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,270
The wooden puppet doesn't have enough power

584
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,070
to shrink it.

585
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,070
The method to return the spiritual soulâ€¦

586
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,610
I knew I heard

587
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,750
something drop.

588
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,070
Master.

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Can you hear me?

590
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,320
This method really worked.

591
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,200
Master,

592
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,640
my primordial spirit

593
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
has returned to my body.

594
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,840
Don't worry.

595
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,560
That's good.

596
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,270
I found the other half

597
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,790
of "The Xuantian Teachings."

598
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,550
Our guess was right.

599
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,130
Unfortunately,

600
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
the wooden puppet couldn't bring it back.

601
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,720
I'll find another way.

602
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,830
And alsoâ€¦

603
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,280
Forget it.

604
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,380
I'd better not tell Master yet

605
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,240
that I've found

606
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
the method to return the spiritual soul.

607
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,930
Otherwise, he'd never agree to it.

608
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,880
Master,

609
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,700
I'll definitely save you.

610
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,540
No matter what,

611
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
don't do anything reckless.

612
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,790
Got it.

613
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,960
How should I tell Su Yu

614
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,550
I've changed my mind and decided to marry him

615
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,790
in a natural way?

616
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,790
What?

617
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,920
You don't like

618
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,240
any of the things

619
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,500
I sent over yesterday?

620
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,270
Maybe I should soften my attitude a bit

621
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,920
and say I like some of them.

622
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,070
No,

623
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,840
that would sound too forced.

624
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,750
I think this hairpin

625
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,150
suits you well.

626
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,400
By the way,

627
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,000
after the court meeting this morning,

628
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,660
I sent someone to Xue Village.

629
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,240
You once said

630
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,160
that the people of Xue Village

631
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,890
offered you food as you grew up.

632
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,160
Our wedding is a grand event,

633
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,750
so naturally, they must be invited.

634
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,690
What are you going to do to them?

635
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't worry.

636
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,610
As long as you agree to marry me,

637
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,510
they

638
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,440
will be honored guests of the Crown Princess.

639
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,100
No one would dare to harm them.

640
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,370
You're using them to threaten me?

641
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,030
Ranran,

642
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,710
I just want you to understand

643
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,620
how serious I am about you.

644
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,440
How about this?

645
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,230
I'll have them brought in

646
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
one by one,

647
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,590
asking you

648
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,110
if you've made your decision

649
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,070
to wear

650
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,330
the wedding dress I've prepared for you.

651
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,830
Let's see

652
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,160
how many of them are left

653
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,920
by the time

654
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,600
I hear the answer I want.

655
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
Don't hurt them!

656
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,960
Fine.

657
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,750
I agree.

658
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,640
I'll marry you.

659
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,030
Let them go.

660
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,850
Y-You finally agreed.

661
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,110
You're finally willing to marry me!

662
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,070
Do I have any other choice?

663
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,450
But if you really want to marry me,

664
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,970
hold the wedding in four days.

665
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,310
In four days?

666
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,120
The Double Ninth Festival?

667
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,070
Since I was little, I've always dreamed that

668
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,590
on the Double Ninth Festival,

669
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,120
I'd wear a red wedding dress

670
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,400
and soar through the sky

671
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,510
with the one I love.

672
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,700
I've been thinking

673
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,130
maybe that is

674
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
fate's plan for me.

675
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,530
That's why

676
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,590
getting married on the Double Ninth Festival

677
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,960
has always been my wish.

678
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,030
As long as it makes you happy,

679
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,920
any day will do.

680
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,440
Also,

681
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,750
if you truly love me,

682
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,880
marry me as Su Yu, the Crown Prince,

683
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,270
with your real face.

684
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,590
The groom has to be you.

685
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,030
Alright.

686
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,810
Whatever you want,

687
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,980
I'll give it to you.

688
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,880
Really?

689
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,710
Then I have one more request.

690
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,000
Before a bride gets married,

691
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,790
she's usually accompanied by her family.

692
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,720
I want my seniors from Wester Sect

693
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,560
to accompany me in the palace.

694
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Don't the Heavenly Ones avoid involvement in court affairs?

695
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,440
It may not be proper

696
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,020
for them to enter the palace.

697
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,370
How about this?

698
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,000
You used to be

699
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
very close to Feihua.

700
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,630
I'll have her accompany you.

701
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Alright then.

702
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,920
I'll send someone

703
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,120
to bring her over now.

704
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,610
Your Highness,

705
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,030
do you really want Concubine Zhou to come over?

706
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,750
It's fine.

707
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,280
Feihua is not able

708
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,880
to cause much trouble anyway.

709
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,350
Do it.

710
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,070
Yes.

711
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,440
Qingge.

712
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,830
Feihua.

713
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,590
You're the real Qingge.

714
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,240
It's just that

715
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,420
I still don't remember

716
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,950
everything about the past.

717
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,190
Has Su Yu

718
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,770
done anything to you these past few days?

719
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,840
He only put me under house arrest,

720
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,920
nothing more.

721
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
But I never thought

722
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,440
he'd become

723
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,530
like this.

724
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,480
All these years,

725
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,380
he'd been waiting for you,

726
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,239
and it had driven him mad.

727
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,139
But when you met again,

728
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,510
everything had changed.

729
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,070
We can't let him

730
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,320
make more mistakes.

731
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,320
Feihua,

732
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,070
actually, Iâ€¦

733
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,909
I need your help with something.

734
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,370
Alright.

735
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,360
I'll try.

736
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,490
Don't worry.

737
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,760
No one around

738
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,550
can hear us.

739
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,840
It's roughly like this.

740
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,030
Li aligns with Kun.

741
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,730
Xun splits left and right.

742
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,850
Heaven and Gen merge as one.

743
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,670
The weakest point of the formation

744
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,930
should be around here.

745
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,880
Have you found a way

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,760
to break the Eastern Palace's formation?

747
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,510
Not yet.

748
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,510
To break the formation, I must locate its core exactly.

749
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,840
And I'll need some help,

750
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
but I can't get out now.

751
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,510
Mu Ranwu,

752
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,440
perhaps she can help me.

753
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,980
Come to think of it,

754
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,080
the binding talisman I put on her

755
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,760
should be wearing off soon.

756
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,000
I understand.

757
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,960
Butâ€¦

758
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,680
what about His Highness?

759
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,840
What will happen to him?

760
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,400
I don't know.

761
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,510
But his body

762
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,330
is indeed running on fumes.

763
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,050
I doubt he can hold on much longer.

764
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,190
No matter what,

765
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,510
I can't let him

766
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,630
make more mistakes

767
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,930
that hurt both himself and others.

768
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,550
I'll be going then.

769
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,670
Feihua,

770
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,230
be careful.

771
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,900
Forgive me, Your Highness.

772
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,880
What's the celebration about?

773
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,930
The Crown Prince and Princess are getting married.

774
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,240
The Crown Princess?

775
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,630
Watch your words!

776
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,160
Leave at once.

777
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,510
Yes.

778
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,030
The Crown Prince is getting married?

779
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,670
Why do I know nothing about this?

780
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,400
Qingge,

781
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,670
don't believe them.

782
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,250
The Crown Prince must

783
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,070
be under some talisman or spell.

784
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,810
Otherwise, why would he recklessly

785
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,590
insist on marrying

786
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,590
a girl who intruded into the palace?

787
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,630
You mean Xue Ranran?

788
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,090
Apologies, Madam Battle,

789
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,400
but without the Crown Prince's permission,

790
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
you may not enter.

791
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,070
Let her in.

792
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I want to see her.

793
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,550
Open the door!

794
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,320
Yes.

795
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,880
[Cool Breeze Palace]

796
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,840
How dare you enter the palace using my identity?

797
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,190
You...

798
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,940
Doesn't your identity

799
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,260
belong to me?

800
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
So you already know

801
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,030
who you really are.

802
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,570
Are you scared now?

803
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,280
You brazenly

804
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,400
took my identity,

805
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,710
but did you never think

806
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,170
there would come a day when you'd be exposed?

807
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Su Yu has also found out?

808
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,360
I can barely remember it.

809
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,530
But I'd like to hear it from you.

810
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,030
I was your elder sister in the previous life.

811
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,800
What did I do to you

812
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,200
to make you

813
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,760
kill me in my previous life?

814
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
After we were reborn,

815
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,260
you stole my Spirit Roots,

816
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,940
used my identity to deceive and harm others,

817
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
and even wanted to kill me again.

818
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,630
Why?

819
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,790
You're asking me why?

820
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,360
Whether in the past or now,

821
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,360
everyone around me,

822
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,590
without exception,

823
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,190
has always spoken of Mu Qingge with admiration.

824
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,320
You were flawless

825
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,030
as a mentor

826
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,840
and as a friend.

827
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,320
But how did you treat me?

828
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,670
You tell me.

829
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,030
You knew full well

830
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,670
I had no talent for cultivation,

831
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,510
that my foundation was so weak

832
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,370
it wasn't even worth mentioning.

833
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,110
Yet you still

834
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,520
dragged me into the cultivation world,

835
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,230
forcing me into a life of endless comparisons,

836
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,510
mockery,

837
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,230
and humiliation.

838
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,030
Do you know

839
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,110
how much that crushed me

840
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,360
and made me wish I were dead?

841
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,710
But

842
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,670
why was I so mediocre?

843
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,960
It was all because of you,

844
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,550
my dear sister.

845
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,630
Me?

846
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,460
That year, when we traveled with our family,

847
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,480
we encountered bandits in the mountains.

848
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,510
Father died protecting you.

849
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,600
If you hadn't caused Father's death...

850
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
If you hadn't

851
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,880
only cared about others

852
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,110
and ignored your own starving,

853
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,570
freezing little sister,

854
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,280
I wouldn't have ended up

855
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,450
with a damaged foundation,

856
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,400
which made immortality impossible for me.

857
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,630
Uncle Ye Xin always praised you,

858
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,360
calling you a prodigy,

859
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,670
but he only told me

860
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,670
that being ordinary was a blessing.

861
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,110
Why was being ordinary my fate?

862
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,030
Do you know

863
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
how cruel

864
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,280
your existence is to me?

865
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,190
Do you have any idea how much I hate you?

866
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,880
Why?

867
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,850
Why can't I be you?

868
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,670
But I died once because of you.

869
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,710
Starting over again,

870
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,070
you got the Spirit Roots and the talent.

871
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,130
Isn't that enough?

872
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,820
You say you hate me.

873
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,330
I won't argue with that.

874
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,280
But for your own benefit,

875
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,000
you killed so many

876
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
innocent people.

877
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,150
What kind of

878
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,680
twisted reasoning is that?

879
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,440
Don't lecture me!

880
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,920
Right,

881
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,070
what's the point of reasoning

882
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,400
with someone so absurd?

883
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,480
She was lured here

884
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,680
just to stir up chaos.

885
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,440
Honestly, I find you

886
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,040
both pitiful and laughable.

887
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,110
You tried so hard to impersonate me,

888
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,880
but in the end,

889
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,400
you're just a cheap imitation,

890
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,550
a failed copy.

891
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,210
You...

892
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,890
What?

893
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,960
Do you still think

894
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,890
I'll indulge you

895
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
like I did in my past life?

896
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,740
Do you still expect me to care about

897
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,140
the family bond you personally destroyed?

898
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,280
Mu Ranwu, you're a joke.

899
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,910
You said you wish I didn't exist,

900
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,190
yet you cling to my old name

901
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,400
to build your life.

902
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,230
Can't you rely on yourself

903
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,960
to live on?

904
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,810
Unfortunately,

905
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,450
a fake will always be a fake.

906
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,370
Su Yu has only ever

907
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,030
wanted to marry me.

908
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,320
Now that I'm back,

909
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,230
you

910
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,510
are finished.

911
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,810
Are you crazy?

912
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,110
Su Yu won't let you off when he returns.

913
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,510
Then I'll kill you first!

914
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,640
Madam Battle,

915
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,090
she's the Crown Prince's honored guest.

916
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,010
You can't hurt her.

917
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,900
You think you can stop me?

918
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,000
Any formation

919
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,070
has its weak point.

920
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,720
I can use a bit of spiritual power here.

921
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,440
This must be the weakest spot

922
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,570
of the palace's defensive formation.

923
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,960
Ranran.

924
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,000
From this weak spot,

925
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,030
anywhere my power

926
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,000
can reach

927
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,620
indicates an opening.

928
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,440
Do you think you can escape?

929
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,920
Bai,

930
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,090
I'm counting on you.

931
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,960
Master.
