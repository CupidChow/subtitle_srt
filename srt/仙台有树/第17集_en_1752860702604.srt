Kodi

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel a few times

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel between the north and the west.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I will give you a thousand times of my life.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am destined to be with you.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
But I still have no fear or regret.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,800
The more the flowers wither, the more I want to be with you.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I hate the moment when you are gone.

Episode 15

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are the girl I visited when I was in the border.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Immortal, can you really let the soul come back to its owner?

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,000
What? You don't look like it.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,600
I was suppressed by you just now because I was badly hurt when I was in the border.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
I haven't recovered yet.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I wasn't that weak before.

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Actually, when you just started, I was shocked by your power.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
You are really good at cultivating.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,600
I will give you all the power when my soul comes back.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Do you know who your soul's owner is?

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Immortal, you should know who your soul's owner is.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
The soul has been protecting me and has been kind to me.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I also want to know who its owner is.

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,800
I don't know if it will have any effect if it lacks the soul.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Of course it will.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,200
It is hard to tell who the soul is without its owner.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
It is so serious.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then you should return the soul as soon as possible.

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Immortal, you...

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
It is a pity that you came to me before I was in the border.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,600
I can also try the soul of the soul owner.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
What about now?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I told you I was badly hurt.

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't do anything now.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Master Yang, please help me.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
All right, girl. You don't have to beg me.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,800
It is up to you to cultivate the soul of the soul owner.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Only those who have no soul can do it.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Right?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Don't be nervous.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
I just like to study the soul.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I am not interested in other people's spiritual treasures.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The ancient skill is in the hands of the one who has no spiritual roots.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,000
If you practice the elixir, you can return the soul.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
What ancient skill?

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't remember the right one.

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,800
But I remember this method is to pay a price.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
It is the price of hurting your own cultivation.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
I am afraid you can't bear to leave.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
I have to repay you.

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
I just want to ask for your help.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Thank you.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
Girl, I like you a little bit now.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Master.

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Why did you bring this Wen Shen here?

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I went to get the wine cup, but he followed me all the way.

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,000
What's the point of coming here if you can't drink?

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Master, sit here.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
You can drink tea.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
You are so cold-hearted.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
You still have this attitude.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
It's not right.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
Ran Ran, listen to Jiu Lang.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Be careful with him.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't be fooled by him.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
No.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
Master is always nice.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Master Liang, you know my master, right?

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I have a grudge.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
I have a grudge against you.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
I have a grudge against you.

74
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I…

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,400
It's been a long time since I tasted the Five Heavenly Immortals.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
If it weren't for someone else,

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
I could have a drink with Qingge today

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
and enjoy the moon with her.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
You tell me.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Mo Yatou is a good person,

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
but she is just not good at looking.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
She has found such an heartless disciple

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
and even hurt her.

85
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Master did it for justice.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Qingge…

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,600
What justice?

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,880
For what?

89
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,760
To kill the demon and save the world?

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Mu Qingge is definitely not a demon.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
How come?

92
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,600
Then who is the demon?

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
There must be someone else.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,160
Mo Yatou must have been

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,080
possessed by a evil person

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,280
or how did she get the spiritual power back?

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,640
If she is a demon,

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
why would she suffer the pain of being abandoned?

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,880
She even used the elixir to stabilize the spiritual power

100
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,680
and took it out of her body.

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,880
She planned to send the spiritual power back to the Youjian from the beginning.

102
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
But why?

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Because she went to the Youjian

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
and only the demon can seal the spiritual power.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Qingge only had to take out the spiritual power

106
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
and seal it temporarily.

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Did she mention anything special

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
that happened in the Youjian?

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,200
She didn't tell me anything.

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,880
But she sent a letter before she went to the Youjian.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,760
In addition to asking me to train the spirit power,

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,880
she also trained some powerful war uniforms.

113
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,520
She said that there must be a forbidden enemy in the Youjian.

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,200
That was when she was still young

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,520
and had little experience.

116
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,320
Who did she fight with?

117
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
Or did she fight in the Youjian?

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,280
Also, what is her background?

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,560
You are asking me?

120
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
I couldn't even ask Mo Yatou.

121
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
She was temporarily in Jiugou Town.

122
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Su Yishui,

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,000
you are asking yourself.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,280
When you accused Mu Qingge of being a demon,

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,040
did you really have evidence to prove it?

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
What?

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
You have nothing to say?

128
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,760
Ranran, look carefully.

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
She is neither good nor good.

130
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,320
What kind of teacher is she?

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,440
She is just a heartless and heartless person.

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Why don't you just stay in Cuiwei Mountain?

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,160
Teacher, it's not what you think.

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,760
I still have some homework to ask you.

135
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
I'll take my leave.

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,440
Teacher.

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,560
Teacher, what does the Nine Immortals mean?

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Is the teacher a demon?

139
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Of course not.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just a rumor.

141
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,280
Teacher, what's wrong?

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Do you think that the real demon

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
should be killed

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
and be cut into pieces?

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't think so.

146
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
I don't think so.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't think so.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
I don't think so.

149
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
I don't think so.

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
But I don't understand.

151
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,080
If there is no spiritual power,

152
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,120
isn't the demon just an ordinary person?

153
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,440
He was born special.

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
He was seen as a poor person

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,080
when he was born.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
He has no choice.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
The real evil source

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
has always been spiritual power.

159
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,520
The teacher might have thought the same way.

160
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,760
So he would rather carry the demon's curse

161
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,360
and seal the spiritual power alone

162
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
and not let the world be difficult for the demon.

163
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
Teacher is angry.

164
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,520
I shouldn't have been so careless.

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,480
No.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,480
What you said is very brave.

167
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,480
I was just talking nonsense.

168
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,320
What is the matter of being so pure-hearted?

169
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,560
You are thinking about it all the way.

170
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
Didn't you ask us to buy

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
medicinal herbs to detoxify the poison?

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
We can go down the mountain to go to the market.

173
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
I will be happy to eat delicious food.

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,400
But why do I smell the word teacher

175
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,560
and it's extremely sweet?

176
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
You are still being so childish.

177
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,800
You can say yes or no.

178
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,200
It's not strange anyway.

179
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,360
Do you know what you mean?

180
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,040
How should I say it?

181
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,080
I don't know if I know it or not.

182
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,200
But Uncle Dorgon told me in secret

183
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,560
that it's a waste of time to hit the master's idea.

184
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,880
It's a waste of time.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Brother,

186
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,680
the medicine is here.

187
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,680
Fatty.

188
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,280
Brother, what are you looking for?

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Nothing.

190
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,920
You go in and buy the medicine first.

191
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,920
I'll go to the front and have a look.

192
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,120
Xi,

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,800
do you think Brother has been very strange these days?

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
He has been going down the mountain together

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,280
and I don't know what he is doing.

196
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,080
It seems a little bit.

197
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
This is the purchase list.

198
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,920
You and Brother Dorgon buy it first.

199
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,200
I'll go and have a look at Brother Dorgon.

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,640
Okay, Xi.

201
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,520
Let's go.

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,600
Rou,

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,880
I miss you so much.

204
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
I've always wanted to see you.

205
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
Let me see

206
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,760
if our beautiful little face

207
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,680
is withered.

208
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Rou,

209
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
you're not around.

210
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
My family is not sleeping well.

211
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,320
I've already made you some bath water.

212
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Go now.

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,920
Xi.

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Rou,

215
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,480
go now.

216
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,520
Go now, Rou.

217
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,400
I've got a bad feeling.

218
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
Can't you find a woman

219
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,040
to seduce a man?

220
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,520
This guy is really going to

221
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
make a big trouble.

222
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm the only woman

223
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,720
who followed Honorable Superior this time.

224
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
If you don't do it,

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,160
do you want me to be in a good relationship with this idiot?

226
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,360
I dare not.

227
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,240
He was hit by a page of the account book.

228
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,920
It's just a hint.

229
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Then he can perform the illusion of life and death.

230
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll report to Honorable Superior

231
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,840
what you've said to him.

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,160
You've made the contribution.

233
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,040
It's okay to take advantage of him.

234
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,600
I'll do anything for Honorable Superior.

235
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
The one who's going to kill the Chis is Master?

236
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,400
What did they find out

237
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
and what are they going to do?

238
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,680
Second Brother, Xi,

239
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm here to help Chu.

240
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
First Brother is here.

241
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
You guys keep an eye on him.

242
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
God of Ice, please listen to my advice.

243
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
I just gave him the blessing.

244
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,520
He's trying to control his luck.

245
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,440
You can just write it out.

246
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Who is he?

247
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,520
Su Yishui is very cautious.

248
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,400
Baibai Mountain

249
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
didn't hear him mention the spiritual spring.

250
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,520
He said he's going to move south the next day.

251
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,480
I think he's going to the spiritual spring.

252
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
I've made Baibai Mountain

253
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,680
endure the poison of the Jiao Gui.

254
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,880
As long as he touches Su Yishui,

255
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,240
he'll be able to make Su Yishui

256
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,480
be aware of the heavy punishment.

257
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,680
Then he'll be able to

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,280
take advantage of Honorable Superior.

259
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,840
You did a good job.

260
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
What about the other fruit?

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
Baibai Mountain doesn't know about it.

262
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,200
But he said

263
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,120
Su Yishui is the most important junior.

264
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,200
And that little girl

265
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
is always carrying a tree branch.

266
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Could it be another fruit?

267
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Little girl, it's you.

268
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
You're Su Yishui's

269
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,240
most important junior.

270
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,480
What's your name?

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,440
Master said that when you're out,

272
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,520
don't call out to strangers.

273
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
I dare not disobey my master's order.

274
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
He's got ears.

275
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
We can hear him

276
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,080
when we're talking in the room.

277
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,800
Where's your master?

278
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,720
He's been waiting outside.

279
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,160
He asked me to ask Master Wei to go out.

280
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,680
Master said that if there's anything he wants to know,

281
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,720
he can ask him.

282
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,200
Why bother?

283
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,320
Go and have a look.

284
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,760
Yes.

285
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Master.

286
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Master.

287
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,280
Go after him.

288
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,920
But Su Yishui is here.

289
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,040
You're not a girl yet.

290
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
If his master is here,

291
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
he won't run away like a rabbit.

292
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Go after him.

293
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,760
Maybe he's another fruit.

294
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,640
Yes.

295
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,440
Wei is here.

296
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Senior, you can't touch him now.

297
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Let's go.

298
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay.

299
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Go and jog.

300
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,680
Go.

301
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Little girl, why are you leaving so soon?

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I can't.

303
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
My whip loves to draw blood.

304
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
If you have to repair the Blood Star Weapon,

305
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,720
you won't be able to stay.

306
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Step aside!

307
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Please, Little Girl!

308
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,720
Little magic array.

309
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Yin Xi!

310
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
It's her.

311
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
The Fire Immortal River!

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Wu Ji Ke.

313
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Don't try to take my power!

314
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
I thought you were capable.

315
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,520
I'll kill you!

316
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Yuan Ran!

317
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Master.

318
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Senior Brother is in the garden of the Flower-picking Array.

319
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
He's the one who poisoned him.

320
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
You must be careful.

321
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Shut up.

322
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I'll help you get rid of the pain.

323
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,320
The Flower-picking Array

324
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
You dare to hurt my disciple?

325
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Retreat!

326
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
You're going to die.

327
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
The Blood Star Weapon

328
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Xue Ran Ran is my mother.

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
So you've been

330
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,920
playing tricks on me.

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
You two

332
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
should both die.

333
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Lao Feng!

334
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Lao Feng!

335
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Your Highness.

336
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
That beast is not at peace again.

337
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Go back to the palace immediately.

338
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Keep an eye on him.

339
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
As long as we can get through the waterways,

340
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
everything will be fine.

341
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Yes.

342
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Your Highness.

343
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,520
He went to investigate the waterways.

344
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,120
But now he's only gone to Puxin River.

345
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,320
There's no news.

346
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,320
If there's no other way out,

347
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
it's the other side of Puxin Village.

348
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
The water is all over the place.

349
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
We can't wait anymore.

350
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
Let's get everyone ready.

351
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,920
Let's go to Puxin Village immediately.

352
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Yes.

353
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
Why didn't you follow him?

354
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm useless.

355
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
After following Master Mu back to the Chimen,

356
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,520
I lost him.

357
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
Master Mu is not here.

358
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,120
How could you

359
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
have a secret meeting with someone

360
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,720
whom you haven't even met?

361
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,120
No matter how people change,

362
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
their nature is hard to change.

363
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,120
Qingge has been honest with you.

364
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,320
It's already the biggest problem to get rid of you.

365
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
He's definitely not Qingge.

366
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Move, move.

367
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,320
Zhenren.

368
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,120
You're awake at last, young lady.

369
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I know you slept for four days.

370
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,160
Don't break the wound

371
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
You didn't see it

372
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,080
Master was so scared that day

373
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,040
On the way, the road was so wide

374
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,780
Those

375
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,200
Master hugged you like this

376
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,240
Said he dared to hurt my disciple

377
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,560
He was so angry

378
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Hug me?

379
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,200
You always hug me back?

380
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
What are you thinking?

381
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,800
You are so rude

382
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,400
Don't get deeper

383
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,080
How can I control it?

384
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,840
Master is so kind

385
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
You don't think so

386
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,320
Do you know you will be killed by master?

387
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,720
The poison in your foot has been cured

388
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
But your cultivation has been damaged by the poison

389
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
You can't turn back

390
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,480
You and I are disciples

391
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,120
You can go

392
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,160
Master

393
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
I didn't mean to

394
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,360
I came to respect you

395
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
I will never betray you

396
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,280
Master

397
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
I don't want to be a loser

398
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,880
You are so powerful

399
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,480
You must have a way

400
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,200
Your family saved my old friend in Xishan

401
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,840
I take you as my disciple for this favor

402
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
But you are so obsessed

403
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
You are injured by the same door

404
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,880
You should be punished with death

405
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,920
Now I just drive you out of the door to save your life

406
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,640
So far

407
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
No need to save you

408
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,480
Master

409
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,840
Master

410
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
Such a serious injury

411
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,600
We êtesore teacher

412
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
We want to beg master

413
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,600
Master only called you for promises

414
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,400
Then we secluded ourselves

415
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,880
How can we seclude ourselves?

416
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Su Yishui, look at you.

417
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You're so angry, how can you be like a master?

418
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You're so scared.

419
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
If I hadn't taken the spiritual power,

420
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
I would have thought you were a repeat of Fu Zhe.

421
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
What's going on?

422
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Why is it so hard to use?

423
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm here.

424
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Only the Demon Lord can change the world.

425
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
And you are the chosen one.

426
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,360
I have put this spiritual power in your heart.

427
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
I will give your body to the power of the spirit.

428
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I thought it was over 19 years ago.

429
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
The spiritual power in my heart was not pulled out.

430
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,360
It's because I got closer to the spiritual power and it moved.

431
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
I didn't find it.

432
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Could it be that he's hiding?

433
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Master, you've been in seclusion for days.

434
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Are you hurt?

435
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm fine.

436
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm fine.

437
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm fine.

438
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
I'm fine.

439
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Are you hurt?

440
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
The Spirit-Guarding Palace was supposed to suppress the spiritual power.

441
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
It's hard to stop it.

442
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
When you find the spiritual power,

443
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
if the spiritual power is still in your heart,

444
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
there will be a reaction.

445
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
There will be a big problem.

446
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
I'm fine.

447
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm fine.

448
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Master.

449
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Master.

450
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Don't move.

451
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
The wound is not healed yet.

452
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Why are you running?

453
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Demon son is a demon son.

455
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Does he really think his fate has changed?

456
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
He's getting closer to spiritual power.

457
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
When he finds spiritual power,

458
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
it will be back to normal.

459
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,360
And we will have a demon son again.

460
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Thank you for your care.

461
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
I've been treating you for days.

462
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Why haven't you recovered?

463
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
My spirit root is damaged.

464
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
It will take me a few days to heal.

465
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Tu Jiuyun.

466
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Honorable Superior.

467
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Leave us.

468
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Yes.

469
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Are you dead?

470
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Honorable Superior.

471
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
You useless thing.

472
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
You can't even catch a little girl.

473
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
And you're injured like this.

474
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
You really have embarrassed the Chis.

475
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
I was careless.

476
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I've been getting better these days.

477
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I'll get that girl.

478
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Lie down and get your wound.

479
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Yes.

480
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Honorable Superior.

481
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
I have one more thing to say.

482
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
What you want is spiritual power.

483
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
You've been fighting with Su Yishui.

484
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
It's not necessary.

485
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Why don't you keep an eye on her?

486
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
When you get the spiritual power,

487
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
you can do something.

488
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Tu Jiuyun.

489
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Remember.

490
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
I'm the master.

491
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
If you dare to break the promise again,

492
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I won't forgive you.

493
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Yes.

494
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Senior Sister likes this thing.

495
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Okay.

496
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I'll take over the Chishen Gate and watch you eat yams.

497
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll call you the master of the Butterfly Valley.

498
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
How can I have such a useless son like you?

499
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,360
You've lost to your senior sister ten times.

500
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,360
How can I expect such a useless person like you?

501
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Fortunately, I have a disciple named Yuan'er.

502
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Yuan'er.

503
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Come.

504
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
This is half of the Chishen Gate Order.

505
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,360
From today on, you are the Chishen Gate's direct order elder.

506
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I'm not here.

507
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,360
You will be in charge of the matters inside the gate.

508
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Greetings, Honorable Superior.

509
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Take this.

510
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,360
I will not disappoint you.

511
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Remember what I said.

512
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Your responsibility is to become his opponent.

513
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,360
You have to constantly stimulate him and train him

514
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,360
so that you can remove the arrogance and arrogance on him.

515
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,360
You must always remind him not to slack off.

516
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Yes.

517
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,360
The Chishen Gate will be handed over to you sooner or later.

518
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,360
From now on, you are the Chishen Gate's direct order.

519
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,360
You must watch your junior well.

520
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,360
But you must be more careful with him.

521
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
The sect leader is not here.

522
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
I have already removed the disciple who was watching the gate.

523
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
You don't need to be punished here.

524
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Get up.

525
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Elder Tu is so powerful.

526
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
You are injured.

527
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Apply some medicine first.

528
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Don't pretend to be a star anymore.

529
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
You are still not satisfied with the Chishen Gate's direct order

530
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
and you still have to fight against me and take credit for it.

531
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Let's wait and see.

532
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,360
We are both in prison.

533
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Can't we go back?

534
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
You can't.

535
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I will go back.

536
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Senior Brother seems to be kneeling.

537
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
You have to plead for him.

538
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
It's no use.

539
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I have made up my mind.

540
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Moreover,

541
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Senior Brother is indeed at fault.

542
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,360
He let us copy the Heart Curse and remove the demon poison.

543
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
But he was lazy and made the Chishen Gate go under the control.

544
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
That's why I don't want to teach him.

545
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
I will not let you be embarrassed.

546
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
You are always more understanding than others.

547
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
If a little demon fails, he will become a big demon.

548
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,360
The Tao of the Immortal is to let people have the ability to surpass the ordinary people.

549
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
If you teach a demon person,

550
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
it will be a thousand years of harm.

551
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
However,

552
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Senior Brother is indeed at fault.

553
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
I am also at fault.

554
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
I also have something wrong.

555
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
What's wrong?

556
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,360
We are young disciples and have a unstable mind.

557
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
The good and evil are in one thought.

558
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,360
And you are only strict in teaching kung fu.

559
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,360
But you have never discussed with us about the way of cultivation.

560
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
What can be done and what can not be done.

561
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
So,

562
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
it's my master's fault.

563
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
I dare not.

564
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
You have your own reason for doing things.

565
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
I am also a human being.

566
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Why can't I do something wrong?

567
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
If one day,

568
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,360
you find that I am a person who does not accept evil,

569
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
what should I do?

570
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
How can you do that?

571
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
If one day,

572
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
I must have some difficulties.

573
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
I am willing to accompany you to live and die with you.

574
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Who asked you to take the responsibility for me?

575
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Protect yourself.

576
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
This is a oxygen pill.

577
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
It is good for your wound.

578
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Eat it.

579
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Master, please save me.

580
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
The oxygen pill Master made is very hard.

581
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I have to drink it with my own secret medicine.

582
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
It's in the drawer in the cabinet.

583
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Do you know how to call for Master's help now?

584
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Is it really that hard?

585
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Nonsense.

586
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Actually, Master likes to eat sweet things.

587
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
He likes to eat sweet things.

588
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I am not a sweet person.

589
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
I am a sweet person.

590
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I am a sweet person.

591
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
I am a sweet person.

592
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I am a sweet person.

593
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
I am a sweet person.

594
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Actually, Master likes to eat sweet things.

595
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
I have found it long ago.

596
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
I have corrected it in the toy.

597
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I will know Master better in the future.

598
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,360
I will improve the toy a little bit.

599
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Master, actually,

600
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I don't know if you have already noticed it.

601
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I...

602
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
I have a gift for you.

603
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Okay, I will take it.

604
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Rest.

605
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Master.

606
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
I have something to say.

607
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Master.

608
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
I know my mistake.

609
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Please don't drive me away.

610
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
You are wrong.

611
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,360
I also have something wrong.

612
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Do you think you are talented

613
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
and don't want to be bullied?

614
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
You think you can control everything.

615
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
But you think you can control everything.

616
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
But you think you can control everything.

617
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
I know my mistake.

618
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
I will correct it.

619
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
If you really correct it,

620
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
I will take a hand from now on.

621
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
I will learn the way to practice qi by Zeng Yi.

622
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
I will learn the way to learn the way to control the power.

623
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
When you can put your name in the middle,

624
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I will take the money back

625
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
and let you go back to Qishan.

626
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
If you can't do it, you won't have a second chance.

627
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,360
I will do it.

628
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Get up.

629
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Get up.

630
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Thank you, master.

631
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Master was always kind.

632
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
After the students made mistakes and were punished,

633
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
they were all compensated.

634
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
But you are not that kind of person.

635
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
What?

636
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Of course I am not.

637
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I just disappointed him.

638
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
He was not like me at that time.

639
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
He was a little rebellious.

640
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
He knew my hard work.

641
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Ranran is right.

642
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I was not good enough to teach my disciple.

643
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I should find some hard work for myself.

644
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Wu Tianxian made by Ranran.

645
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Liang Wumeng gave it to me.

646
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I think you have been too tight

647
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
because you were injured.

648
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Now Ranran is awake.

649
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Don't worry.

650
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Take it.

651
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
You are too hard-working.

652
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
It's not good to be a master.

653
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
You should relax occasionally.

654
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Ranran.

655
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Ranran.

656
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Master is soft-hearted.

657
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
He will come back.

658
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
You are so good.

659
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
What did you use to change master's mind?

660
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I just said some new ideas.

661
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,360
The important thing is

662
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
master will listen to me.

663
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
It's useless to say it.

664
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
It's useless to talk to him.

665
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
It seems that master

666
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
is different from you.

667
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
You are right.

668
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,360
Do you think

669
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
he will

670
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
just

671
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
will

672
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
have...

673
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
You are so

674
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
good at talking.

675
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
I can't breathe.

676
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
You just want to ask

677
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,360
whether master likes you.

678
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Then,

679
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
only master knows it.

680
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,360
No. I can't wait.

681
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
I have to ask him now.

682
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
You are so good at it.

683
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
You forgot what master said

684
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,360
that master's

685
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
mind is to be hit by thunder.

686
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
So what?

687
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
I am a fruit.

688
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,360
I can do nothing.

689
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Thunder can't hit me.

690
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
I am so good at it.

691
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
I can't wait to see how you will do it.

692
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
I just want to ask

693
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,360
whether master

694
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
likes you.

695
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
I have to ask.

696
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Let's go.

697
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Let's go.

698
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Master.

699
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
Master.

700
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Master.

701
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Master.

702
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Master.

703
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Master.

704
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
I think

705
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
you are better.

706
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
You are more attractive.

707
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
I am afraid

708
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
what I want

709
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
is not enough.

710
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
I think

711
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I should ask

712
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
whether master likes me.

713
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
I think

714
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
you are better.

715
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
I think

716
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
you are better.

717
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
I think

718
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
you are better.

719
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
I think

720
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
you are better.

721
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
I think

722
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
you are better.

723
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Why did you ask me to come?

724
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Are you

725
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,360
waiting for me?

726
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I have waited for you for many years.

727
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
I waited

728
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
but I didn't seem to wait.

729
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
What do you mean?

730
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
I am right here.

731
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Yes, you are right here.

732
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
You are also very good.

733
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
But one day

734
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
you will leave me.

735
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
No.

736
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I don't want to leave you.

737
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
I used to think

738
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
about going down the mountain

739
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
and living the life I want.

740
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
I want

741
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
to have a family

742
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
to accompany me

743
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
and stay with me forever.

744
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
But I have been with you for a long time.

745
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
You taught me

746
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
and protected me.

747
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
You are
