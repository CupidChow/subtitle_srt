Dating corner

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I only wish to travel to all the lands and the west and the north.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of my love.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am destined to be the one to give my love back to the past.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I still have no fear or regret.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love and hate of the world.

Episode 16

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is what I made.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For you.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am sorry.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am sorry.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I am sorry.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am sorry.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am sorry.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I am sorry.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am sorry.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You liked these things before.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Before?

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Master, you...

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Master, you drank wine?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Master, you...

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who do you see me as?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are...

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
a woman who can be seen as a woman.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You are...

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
a woman who can be seen as a woman.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are...

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
a woman who can be seen as a woman.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
Who do you think I am?

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Who?

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
Of course, you're the one

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,240
I've been thinking about for the past 19 years.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
What about you?

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
What do you think I am?

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
I thought you had some feelings for me.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,960
But you still went to Su Yu

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,200
after you had a hard time with him.

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
Master, you're drunk.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
I'm not...

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Then tell me.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,080
Everyone says that Mu Qingge is obsessed with me.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,640
Is that true?

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Some people say that you're the best

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,320
because you're good at smiling.

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
It's a shame

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,400
to let you think that's obsession.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
If I have another chance,

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll still be a deity.

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't avoid it.

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,480
I knew I shouldn't have done that.

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,920
Even if it's just a momentary warmth,

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
I still want to be in love.

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,800
But God is always teasing me.

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,840
The one I love is right in front of me.

58
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,320
But I can't save her.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
I can't let her go either.

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,560
Is that all I can do?

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Is that all I can do?

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
Master, look carefully.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,600
Who are you in front of?

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
It's you.

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,160
I want to spend my days with you.

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
The sword in the heart of the world.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,620
The

68
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,000
What am I doing?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,080
If you still want me to be with you,

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,480
I'll do it for you.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
If you still want me to be with you,

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
I'll do it for you.

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
If you still want me to be with you,

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,440
I'll do it for you.

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,720
The sword in the heart of the world.

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,600
The sword in the heart of the world.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll do it for you.

78
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,720
Master, you really think too much about the world.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Zhenzhen is the first love in the world.

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,560
The sword in the heart of the world.

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,640
Xue Ranran,

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
you're so stupid.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,200
Shanran, how are you?

84
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
You didn't scare me.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,080
Why do you have bitter and bitter?

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,480
I shouldn't have thought about Master.

87
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,640
I was really shocked.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,560
Master.

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
The medicine for Tu Jiuyan.

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Yes.

91
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
There's a lot of powder.

92
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
I only take a small portion.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,560
I'll do it for you.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Is there a higher category products

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,680
in the number No. 7 bank's pharmacy?

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,000
Bring it to him,送去 his laundry.

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
I've already housing a big house.

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,360
I can't keep two nature- 맛있는 places anymore.

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,840
Understand?

100
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,320
Understood.

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,380
The

102
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,340
celebration of a undertimid

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,220
This has been the most romantic

104
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,140
ing since last year

105
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,180
Alright

106
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,000
A Goes to Glen

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,200
What's the point of me asking for this?

108
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Get lost!

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Yes.

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Come, drink with me.

111
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Zi Yun.

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Elder, why are you up?

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
Why is it so noisy outside?

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
It's because Honorable Superior

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,000
is looking for those

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
five-girls to continue to play the music.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Honorable Superior.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Good wine.

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Honorable Superior, come here.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Honorable Superior, come here.

121
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Honorable Superior,

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
why are you so absurd

123
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
in the main hall?

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Get out.

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Get out!

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Where are you going?

127
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Honorable Superior.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Honorable Superior.

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Come here.

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Honorable Superior.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Come here.

132
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,080
the road will be dark,

133
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
and you'll be worried about her.

134
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,020
How can I

135
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,920
let such a woman

136
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,840
protect me with her life?

137
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Honorable Superior, you're drunk.

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
Why are you running?

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Are you playing the Yuxing Gu Zong with me?

140
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
Honorable Superior, I...

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I...

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Why are you here?

143
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,400
You were drunk last night.

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I... I'm drunk.

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I wouldn't...

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Honorable Superior,

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,400
this is the whole Yie City of this store.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,400
Even if I'm drunk,

149
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
are you dead?

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You...

151
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
You're trying to make me suffer.

152
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,600
You're trying to do something.

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm the one who's trying to do it.

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm sorry for not meeting you.

155
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,000
Shut up. Stop talking.

156
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Just pretend it never happened.

157
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You're not allowed to mention this to anyone.

158
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Otherwise...

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Report!

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Honorable Superior,

161
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
the store...

162
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
The head of the store.

163
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
What are you looking at?

164
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
If you dare to say a word,

165
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
I'll cut your tongue.

166
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Yes.

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
What is it?

168
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,200
Speak.

169
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:12,440
The Chilu

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Why are you still standing there?

171
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Hurry up and leave.

172
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Don't let anyone see you.

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
How did this happen?

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,800
From now on...

175
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,600
You need to work harder.

176
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You!

177
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I didn't see anything!

178
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,220
I didn't see anything!

179
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,140
Spare me, Your Majesty.

180
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
When did I say I wanted your life?

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Get up.

182
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm not wrong.

183
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
How will you deal with her?

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,800
Kill her.

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
You can't kill her.

186
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
I... I'll just take her.

187
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,800
I didn't mean that.

188
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Wenxiang,

189
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
I'll be honest.

190
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Look.

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,000
We will need a female host to handle the matter for you sooner or later.

192
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Chief,

193
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
you've been working hard for years.

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
You're just right to grow up with Master.

195
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Isn't that just right?

196
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Right?

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,400
She's been so stubborn and never softened up.

198
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,400
How is that right?

199
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Wait.

200
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,000
I got the one-night deal.

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
She didn't.

202
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
But she didn't push me away.

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Doesn't that mean I won?

204
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
That's right.

205
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
I won?

206
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
If that's the case,

207
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,400
why would I lose my reputation?

208
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
That's right.

209
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Let's go.

210
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Let's go.

211
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's go.

212
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Let's go.

213
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Chief.

214
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
You may leave.

215
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes.

216
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
You're just in time.

217
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
I've just decided.

218
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,200
Since you've been working for the Chimney,

219
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll let you sit on my right side

220
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
and work for me.

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,400
No need.

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm here to tell you.

223
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,200
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

224
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
I've made up my mind.

225
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
We'll just spend the night together.

226
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
That's all.

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
You really think so?

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
So what?

229
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
You said so.

230
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
I've given you a chance.

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Don't pester me anymore.

232
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Don't worry, Chief.

233
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm not going to do anything stupid.

234
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
You saved me a lot of trouble.

235
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
A night of filial piety?

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
You treat me as filial piety?

237
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
Good for you, Tu Jiuyuan!

238
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Chief.

239
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Chief.

240
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Mu Xing is at the hall.

241
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,600
He wants to see you.

242
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Chief.

243
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Why is Lady Mu here today?

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Why is she here?

245
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Filial piety?

246
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,000
I finally got a chance to fight against Su Yishui.

247
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,600
But I messed it up.

248
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm so mad that I can't sleep at night.

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
How can I be so generous to Chief Wei?

250
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,000
I won't blame him for his mistakes.

251
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Chief.

252
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
What do you mean by that?

253
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
This useless Tu Jiuyuan is a big trouble.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
He even used death to make up for it.

255
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
What's the point of keeping him?

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Why don't you kill him?

257
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It's my business.

258
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,000
It's your turn to tell me.

259
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Tu Jiuyuan is under my control.

260
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
I want him to die.

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
He'll die.

262
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm happy to let him live.

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You don't have the right to talk nonsense.

264
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
I can scold him.

265
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
But you can't.

266
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
Do you hear me?

267
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,800
I didn't expect Chief Wei to protect him.

268
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It's none of your business.

269
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Tell me.

270
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,600
What are you here for?

271
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm here for Su Yishui

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,200
and the other fruit.

273
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
The other fruit?

274
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
You found her whereabouts.

275
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
Is she Su Yishui's disciple?

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

277
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
That day, under the mountain,

278
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
the girl's spirit energy was moved.

279
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
I felt it in the dark.

280
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
My spirit energy was also moved.

281
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
It must be her.

282
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
She's not wrong.

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
You're really something.

284
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
If so,

285
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Su Yishui, you're so stubborn.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
You keep fooling me.

287
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,000
I won't let you off.

288
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
I have a plan.

289
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Wait.

290
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
It's a bit strange.

291
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Why did Su Yishui

292
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
hide your useless sister?

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
What does she want?

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
Why do you care?

295
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
As long as you kill their disciple,

296
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
you can take revenge

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
for Su Yishui several times.

298
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
My memory and spirit energy

299
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
will be back.

300
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Your spirit power will be yours.

301
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
You used to be very generous.

302
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Why are you more anxious

303
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,200
than me to kill them?

304
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
I was generous before,

305
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
but what happened?

306
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I'll make them pay

307
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
for what they did to me.

308
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
You're as bad as me now.

309
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
You're so boring.

310
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Tell me.

311
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
What do you want to do?

312
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Master.

313
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Your wounds have been healed

314
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
in the past few days.

315
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
After breakfast,

316
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,800
you can go down the mountain

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
with your master.

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Bai Bishan.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Go back to practice with me.

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes.

321
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Yes, Master.

322
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
I wonder how they are doing.

323
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
They're used to it.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,200
We're going to say goodbye to you.

325
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
Sorry for the trouble.

326
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,200
Thank you for your care.

327
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll make you wine

328
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
when I'm free.

329
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay.

330
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Ranran.

331
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,800
I like your ancient style.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll give you these little weapons.

333
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
It might be helpful on the way.

334
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
The gift from Master Liang

335
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
must be a good thing.

336
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Thank you, Master.

337
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
And,

338
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I know.

339
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
This is the talisman

340
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,600
that Mu Yatao

341
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
wanted to cure for her.

342
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
This talisman can help

343
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
seal the evil things in the world.

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,800
You'll need it in the future.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can take it

346
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,000
and fulfill

347
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Qingge's request.

348
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Thank you, Master.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
I'll keep it well.

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Thank you.

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Take care.

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,800
Your Highness.

353
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
The village is not far from here.

354
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,400
The waterway is at the west of the village.

355
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
You can get there in two hours

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,400
along this path.

357
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Keep going

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
after you're done.

359
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

360
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,400
Your Highness.

361
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
A few car wheels are stuck in front.

362
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,200
They fell into the mud.

363
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
It's not suitable for a car.

364
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Mud?

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,800
Go around

366
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
the road next to it.

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Yes.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Ranran.

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Since last night,

371
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,000
you and Master

372
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
have been poisoned by a fire demon.

373
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Your nose is about to go bad.

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
What happened

375
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
between you and Master last night?

376
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
What happened between you and Master last night?

377
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,200
Okay?

378
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't ask.

379
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes.

380
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
But where are we going?

381
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
The place is not far from the village.

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Could it be that Master took us to the demon?

383
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
The transfer value has a reaction.

384
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
We should go there.

385
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,600
Ranran, what's wrong?

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Ranran,

387
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
are you feeling unwell?

388
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I've done it before.

389
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
But I forgot it all at the beginning.

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
What's wrong?

391
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Now I'm in a state

392
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
of being a stranger.

393
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I should be the one who's far away from it.

394
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I see.

395
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Xuan Ranran,

396
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,600
stop.

397
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,800
You've been in a state of mood since this morning.

398
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
Which part of you are you singing?

399
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
I...

400
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
I couldn't sleep last night

401
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,600
and couldn't sleep.

402
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Unlike Master,

403
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
he's full of spring breeze and glowing.

404
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
It seems that the wine last night

405
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
is really fragrant.

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Qiu Xier.

407
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Master.

408
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
Why is he so angry today?

409
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
Master, you ask me.

410
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,000
You don't know.

411
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
How can I know?

412
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I can tell.

413
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Forget it.

414
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
I shouldn't have given it a thought.

415
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,400
It's better to forget everything.

416
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
This is the return of Donggong.

417
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Why are these cars suddenly broken here?

418
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
The road is flat.

419
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
They won't be in danger, right?

420
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
There seems to be no one nearby.

421
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
There shouldn't be any problem.

422
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Why did Su Yu come here?

423
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Ji Wu Shi, why are you still here?

424
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm here now.

425
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm here.

426
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
What are you talking about?

427
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm here.

428
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Then why do you come here?

429
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Why don't you tell me why you come here?

430
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
You don't know, right?

431
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Let's go.

432
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Why did you come here?

433
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
You mean, why did you come here?

434
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Why do you come here?

435
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Why do you come here?

436
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I don't know.

437
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,620
I can't.

438
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,640
Who?

439
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,440
Get out

440
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
Don't come in

441
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,280
They want me to get you out

442
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,920
Get out

443
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Say it properly.

444
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't get up.

445
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,080
Don't get up.

446
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,880
Be careful.

447
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
He must be a lunatic.

448
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,960
He runs away so fast.

449
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,400
Let's go.

450
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
Are you annoyed?

451
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,240
Because we just got here.

452
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,320
I said I am bothered.

453
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,280
Don't run away.

454
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,280
We've been walking in the countryside for so long,

455
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,440
and I finally see people.

456
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,000
Come on.

457
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,400
Come on. Sit inside.

458
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,960
Here, have some tea.

459
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,120
My name is Liu.

460
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,320
If you need anything,

461
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,840
just tell me.

462
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,360
Uncle Liu,

463
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,640
have you seen

464
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
a troop of the marches

465
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
passing by recently?

466
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,440
There was a

467
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,400
very elegant and elegant young man.

468
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,320
Well,

469
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
I've never seen him before.

470
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,160
But

471
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
there are still a few families in the village.

472
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,120
I can help you ask them.

473
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,040
I see that the mountains are dense here.

474
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,280
The traffic is convenient.

475
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,000
Why is the village so desolate?

476
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,680
It seems that there are few people.

477
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,160
There were indeed a lot of people

478
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,720
in our village before.

479
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,200
It was very lively.

480
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,680
But for the past ten years,

481
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
I don't know why,

482
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
there have been earthquakes everywhere.

483
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,320
People passing by nearby

484
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,600
have been missing.

485
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,280
Earthquakes?

486
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,800
There are such strange things?

487
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,760
Yes.

488
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,400
What's more strange is

489
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,960
that the earthquakes

490
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,480
will be fixed by themselves soon.

491
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,720
The villagers want to find someone

492
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
to dig from where the earthquakes were.

493
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,120
They've never found the body.

494
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Miss,

495
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,480
will the people you're looking for

496
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,480
also encounter earthquakes?

497
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,880
If so,

498
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
I'm afraid of danger.

499
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,240
How could there be

500
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,280
such a place where people are not at all at ease?

501
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,760
I wonder

502
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,360
if the mountain gods are angry.

503
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,440
Everyone in the village ran away.

504
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,400
Why didn't the old man leave?

505
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,720
The old man

506
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,920
is already buried in the soil.

507
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,240
He should have stayed

508
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,400
and woken up the people passing by.

509
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Don't be sad, old man.

510
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,800
Our master is very powerful.

511
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,480
He can definitely see what's wrong.

512
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,200
I'll help you solve the problem.

513
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,560
Thank you.

514
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,880
You're the late masters of the Xuan Sect.

515
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,960
I'm not familiar with the mountain.

516
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,960
Please help us, late masters.

517
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
I'm not interested.

518
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,320
Don't worry, old man.

519
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'll do my best to investigate this matter.

520
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,400
Thank you, late master.

521
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,720
Thank you, late master.

522
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way, old man,

523
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,360
there's a crazy woman

524
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
in the village.

525
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
When we entered the village,

526
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,000
she brought a bottle of water to splash on us.

527
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,200
There's no crazy woman in the village.

528
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
It's probably dark.

529
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,240
You must have seen it wrong.

530
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,760
It's getting late.

531
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,000
If you don't mind,

532
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,400
you can stay here.

533
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,840
I'll show you around

534
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,120
when it's dawn tomorrow.

535
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
Thank you.

536
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
You're free to go.

537
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I'll get back to work.

538
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
Since I entered this village,

539
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
there's always been a strange feeling

540
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,520
in my heart.

541
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,160
Maybe it's related to the monster in this village.

542
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,320
Is it really the spirit power?

543
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,360
Maybe this is the spirit power.

544
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,480
This village is weird.

545
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,560
Mr. Yu's carriage

546
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,400
fell in the middle of the road.

547
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
It feels weird more and more.

548
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
Could they be people

549
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,080
hiding creates evil features?

550
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,040
much better.

551
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,840
What can we do about this?

552
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,960
Let alone the T hunting martial arts we've never practiced.

553
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:26,840
Aww Nanny, doANDLE

554
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Great, I won't be your wife

555
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I'll go to the capital to find Liang Wu Meng

556
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
and cure Ling Xiao

557
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
and return her to her master.

558
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Then I'll go live a life I've always wanted.

559
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Travel the mountains and rivers and seas.

560
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Get closer to the world's scenery.

561
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
And finally,

562
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,400
marry a handsome and good-looking man.

563
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Live my little life in peace.

564
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay.

565
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Marry a good-looking man.

566
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I'll prepare a wedding dress for you.

567
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
You can count on me.

568
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Oh, no!

569
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Oh, no!

570
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Oh, no!

571
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I just went to the west side of the village to fetch water.

572
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
It seems that there is a land mine over there.

573
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Let's go over there and have a look.

574
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Yes.

575
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
It's a land mine.

576
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
It's not empty.

577
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
There's a token here.

578
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Ran Ran.

579
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
This is...

580
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Master Yu and the Tie Shen Guard's token.

581
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Master!

582
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
It's really Master Yu and the Tie Shen Guard who are in danger.

583
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
We have to find a way to save them.

584
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
The land is so tight.

585
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
It's really a land mine.

586
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
It's been here for a long time.

587
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
It's a place where the land is so tight.

588
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
It's a place where the land is so tight.

589
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
The land has already become a meat pie.

590
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
We don't have to waste our energy.

591
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
This place is indeed strange.

592
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
We can't stay here for long.

593
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
We'll talk about it when we get out.

594
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Master!

595
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Even if there's any suspicion about Master Yu,

596
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
but the whereabouts of the Yi Xing people are unknown.

597
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
How can we just leave like this?

598
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
The Xuan Gate is not suitable for the temple.

599
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Master Yu is my friend.

600
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I won't leave him alone.

601
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Ran Ran! Don't come over here!

602
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
You did it for Su Yu again.

603
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
You haven't changed a bit.

604
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Master!

605
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
This is the real place.

606
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Master!

607
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
The怨气 here is very strong. Don't run around.

608
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Didn't Master say that he won't take care of me?

609
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
If I can't even take care of my own disciple,

610
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
if the news spreads, where will the shame of Xishan go?

611
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
That's right.

612
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm just Master's disciple.

613
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
How can he not take care of me when I'm in danger?

614
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
But in his heart,

615
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm just a disciple.

616
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I'm just a disciple.

617
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm just a disciple.

618
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
I'm just a disciple.

619
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm just a disciple.

620
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
But in his heart,

621
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
I'm just a disciple.

622
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Don't worry, Master.

623
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
I won't let anything happen to you.

624
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
I won't let anything happen to you.

625
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Master! Ran Ran!

626
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Master!

627
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
The怨气 here is very strong.

628
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Be careful.

629
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Let's go and take a look.

630
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
This is the place where the people who were

631
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
swallowed by the Dielie

632
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
were told to be.

633
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
They're all here.

634
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
This place is very deep.

635
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Ordinary people can't get in here.

636
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
No wonder the villagers couldn't find the bones.

637
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
What is that?

638
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
It's the soldiers of the Eastern Palace.

639
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
How did they become like this?

640
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Young Master Yu!

641
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Wake up!

642
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I still have the breath.

643
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I can't die.

644
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Young Master Yu, you're awake.

645
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Ran Ran.

646
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Come.

647
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Young Master Yu, are you okay?

648
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Are you okay?

649
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm fine.

650
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm fine.

651
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
It's all a piece of cake.

652
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Fortunately, Ran Ran found the trace of the Crown Prince.

653
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Now, he's found the coffin.

654
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
You entered such a dangerous place

655
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
just to save me?

656
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Isn't there still Master and the others?

657
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Young Master Yu,

658
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
why are you here?

659
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
What happened?

660
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I just remembered that when we entered the village,

661
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
the Dielie suddenly collapsed.

662
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
We didn't react and then it fell.

663
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Later, I was injured

664
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
and was carried away for a while.

665
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I don't know why, but I was knocked down on the ground.

666
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
I was half awake and half awake.

667
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
I saw everyone

668
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
as if they were all naked.

669
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Protect the Crown Prince!

670
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
I was completely confused.

671
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I thought it was these soldiers

672
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
who were trying to protect me

673
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
and then I ran out of breath.

674
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
These soldiers' souls have disappeared.

675
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I was so confused

676
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
that I couldn't even see the Crown Prince.

677
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
I was so confused

678
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
that I couldn't even see the Crown Prince.

679
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
How come?

680
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
How could this happen?

681
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
I wanted to use the Sword of Wood to check their memories,

682
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
but I was unable to see anything.

683
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Their souls

684
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
must have been absorbed by something.

685
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Could it be the Holy Spring?

686
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,320
Sir,

687
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,480
what is that?

688
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
There's an ha更**** here,

689
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,020
tell the pens to sells.

690
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,000
Keep the search.

691
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Ancestral$$cute

692
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,600
Dad! Be careful.

693
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Master, Ran Ran.

694
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Ran Ran.

695
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Master, Ran Ran.

696
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Xing Er.

697
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Save me.

698
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Second Senior Brother. Second Senior Brother.

699
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Second Senior Brother.

700
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Second Senior Brother, why are you...

701
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Ran Ran.

702
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Ran Ran, come here.

703
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
It's dangerous there.

704
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Come to me.

705
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
No.

706
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
I can't.

707
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I can't.

708
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I can't.

709
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
I can't.

710
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
I can't.

711
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I can't.

712
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I can't.

713
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I can't.

714
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I can't.

715
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I can't.

716
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Master wouldn't talk to me so easily.

717
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Where did the demon come from?

718
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
How dare you lie to me?

719
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,400
These monsters can even seduce people.

720
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Ran Ran.

721
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Xue Ran Ran.

722
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
You...

723
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Who are you?

724
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm your master, Su Yi Shui.

725
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
The monsters here can imitate people's voices and create illusions.

726
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Once they are attracted to you and look into your eyes,

727
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
they will absorb your soul.

728
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
They will be like the soldiers before, they will be deified.

729
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
If you hear anything, you must not believe it.

730
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You can't even look into their eyes.

731
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
But,

732
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
they can only steal the voice in your memory and imitate it.

733
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
They won't recognize your identity.

734
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm sorry.

735
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I can tell you who I am.

736
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
You can rest assured.

737
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Rest assured?

738
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Maybe the monster turned into a master to trick me.

739
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
The environment said that

740
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,400
the master hates the appearance of others praising him the most.

741
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
You're really pretty.

742
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Go out and take a look when you like it.

743
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Follow me now.

744
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Don't run.

745
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
I'm not running to be your snack?

746
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
You pretend to be like me.

747
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
You're a troublesome toy.

748
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Didn't I say that I can't believe what's written in the toy?

749
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Did you bring the dragon eye liver?

750
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Dragon eye liver?

751
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
You like to eat this?

752
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
I don't like it.

753
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
But you know I like it.

754
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Last time, you were so hard to make the dragon eye liver for me.

755
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I told you that I don't like it.

756
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
But then,

757
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I ate it all.

758
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
You ate it all?

759
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
And,

760
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
I told you to call for help when you're in danger.

761
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
But you didn't listen.

762
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm angry.

763
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Do you have anything else to ask me to prove?

764
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Master, do you still remember last night, we...

765
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Xing!

766
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Yanran!

767
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
It's Senior Brother and the others.

768
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Master!

769
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Xing.

770
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Xing!

771
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Do you believe me now?

772
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Okay, then stay here.

773
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Actually, I'll go save them.

774
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Xiaoyu.

775
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Xiaoyu.

776
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Xing.

777
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Xiaoyu.

778
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Xing.

779
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Master.

780
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Hurry up.

781
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Master Yu.

782
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Master Yu.

783
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Master Yu.

784
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Shan Shan.

785
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Luckily, it was just a moment.

786
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm fine.

787
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I only lost half of my soul.

788
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I can still come back.

789
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Shan Shan.

790
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,400
The night falls, the sky is empty.

791
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,400
The sky is dark, the clouds are dark.

792
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Tears are like dreams,

793
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,400
but they are only a shadow.

794
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,400
I want to return to you,

795
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
but my heart is still watered down.

796
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,400
The tears in my heart are still not resolved.

797
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,400
The moon is looking at the sky, I'm looking at the snow.

798
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,400
The fate is in my hand,

799
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,400
the wind and I are still in this line.

800
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm not afraid of the world if I have you.

801
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,400
If I have the right to be with you,

802
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,400
I will be with you forever.

803
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
I can't escape from this fate,

804
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,400
I hope to turn back time.

805
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Why does the heaven look at me and I'm alone?

806
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,400
I chase after the eternal night,

807
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,400
only to be with you day after day.

808
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,400
If I have the right to be with you,

809
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I will be with you forever.

810
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,400
I can't escape from this fate,

811
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,400
I hope to turn back time.

812
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I once dreamed of the world,

813
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
but I was wrong.

814
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I can't escape from this fate,

815
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,400
I once dreamed of the world,

816
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
but I was wrong.

817
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,400
I once dreamed of the world,

818
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,400
but I was wrong.
