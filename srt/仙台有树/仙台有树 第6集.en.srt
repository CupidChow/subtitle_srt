[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,940
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,610
Why?

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,460
Why do you always make decisions on your own?

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,230
You don't trust me,

6
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,440
yet why do you take the blame for me?

7
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,710
Just because you're my master,

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,030
you think you can say nothing

9
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,960
and die for me?

10
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,980
Using your death to punish me,

11
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,100
is this your way of being a master?

12
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,630
Master.

13
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,329
You can't just end it this way.

14
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,780
I will never accept your kindness.

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,800
Even if I have to tear down the sky,

16
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,430
I'll bring you back to life.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,750
I'll pay

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,190
my own debt.

19
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
What I owe you,

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,900
I'll definitely pay you back.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,690
Master.

22
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,630
Mu Qingge!

23
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,830
Yishui!

24
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,950
Su Yishui!

25
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,310
Su Yishui!

26
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
Yishui.

27
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,870
I can

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,690
let bygones be bygones.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
Did Mu Qingge

30
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,090
tell you

31
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,250
the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring?

32
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,010
We still have a chance to turn the tables.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,270
Yishui,

34
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,940
you are still the Demon's child.

35
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
As long as you're willing,

36
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,800
we can

37
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,740
find the Spirit Spring again

38
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,200
and reclaim the universe.

39
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,750
Leading the entire universe,

40
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
isn't that what you want?

41
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,310
Su Yishui!

42
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,990
You, an immortal master of the mortal world,

43
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,250
are becoming increasingly outrageous.

44
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,870
You stole the Ice Lotus before

45
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,160
and chased away the guardian cat.

46
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Today you broke into my cave.

47
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,350
Do you no longer care for your mortal body?

48
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,390
I, Su Yishui,

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
beg you to grant me the Reincarnation Tree

50
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
to save my master.

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,430
The Reincarnation Tree is such a divine object.

52
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,270
You're just an immortal master of the mortal world.

53
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,830
You can't just simply ask for it.

54
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,960
I beg for your mercy.

55
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,550
The Reincarnation Tree

56
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,270
is right behind the Thousand Light Beams.

57
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,670
Let's see if you can risk your life to get it.

58
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,000
Su Yishui.

59
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,390
Su Yishui.

60
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Su Yishui.

61
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,960
Even if you risked your life

62
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,150
to get the Reincarnation Tree,

63
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,870
it would not be enough

64
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,470
to compensate for the kindness you owe Master.

65
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,270
It has borne fruit.

66
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,720
These two

67
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,690
are Master and Mu Ranwu.

68
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,260
But why did Mu Ranwu

69
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,870
have to rush into the formation at the end

70
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,870
and lose her life?

71
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,770
She was insignificant,

72
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,920
but under the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Curse,

73
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,040
their souls were shattered

74
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,170
and mixed together.

75
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,090
They can only be reborn together now.

76
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,080
When will Master be able to return?

77
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,670
The Reincarnation Tree defies the heavens.

78
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,800
It will take 18 years for her to return.

79
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,510
You're so severely injured.

80
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,010
You need to go into seclusion to preserve your life.

81
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,790
During these 18 years,

82
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,990
if anything happens,

83
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,690
how will you protect her?

84
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I have my own ways.

85
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,900
Why are you extracting your own spiritual soul?

86
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,960
The Reincarnation Tree absorbs the Golden Core,

87
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,360
using the soul as a guide.

88
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,960
After this, I will seclude myself and lose all five senses.

89
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,620
This part of my spiritual soul

90
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,480
can accompany her.

91
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,270
You've also placed a restriction on her appearance.

92
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,400
After she is reborn,

93
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,000
what everyone sees

94
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,480
will no longer be Mu Qingge's appearance.

95
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,220
This time,

96
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,670
I absolutely won't

97
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,530
let worldly affairs disturb her.

98
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,630
Su Yishui,

99
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
when you eliminated Mu Qingge,

100
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,390
the barrier you raised

101
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,520
was actually

102
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,580
to collect her remaining soul.

103
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
Why did you give up

104
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,390
the Transcendence Realm that was within your grasp

105
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,550
and use half a Golden Core

106
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,010
to reincarnate Mu Qingge?

107
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,210
To break the curse.

108
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,510
Besides the Face-and-Heart Burning Curse,

109
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,570
Mu Qingge also placed another curse.

110
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,300
It was to

111
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
tie the lifeline of Mount Wester's disciples

112
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,870
to her own.

113
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,550
If she dies tragically,

114
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,320
the descendants of Mount Wester

115
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,720
will suffer the same fate for generations.

116
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
Your Mount Wester

117
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,200
has only a few dozen people.

118
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,620
How can you risk the lives of all people for them?

119
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,570
After Mu Qingge's death,

120
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,000
the Spirit Spring's whereabouts became unknown.

121
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,730
Don't you want to find the Spirit Spring anymore?

122
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,920
If you don't agree,

123
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,670
then I will fight to the death

124
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,730
against all of you.

125
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,550
In 18 years,

126
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,910
Immortal Kaiyuan, you will face the heavenly tribulation.

127
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,440
If Mu Qingge reincarnates,

128
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,070
she can break the curse on Mount Wester

129
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,330
and help you withstand the tribulation.

130
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,380
Do you want to risk death today

131
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,570
or fight for survival in 18 years?

132
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,370
Fine.

133
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,360
Heaven values all life.

134
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,270
I'll agree to your request.

135
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,690
We'll leave this Reincarnation Tree.

136
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,980
When the Reincarnation Tree bears fruit in 18 years,

137
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,380
we will come back to personally oversee it.

138
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
Even if Mu Qingge can reincarnate,

139
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,910
we won't give her any chance to do evil.

140
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,130
In 18 years,

141
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,720
I'll come to pick you up.

142
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,600
You're already at the end of your rope.

143
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Why don't you go into seclusion quickly?

144
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,250
There's one more thing she entrusted me with.

145
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,660
[Wangxiang Pass, Cave]

146
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,710
I originally wanted to seal the Spirit Spring back in the netherworld,

147
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,680
but I found out

148
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,440
only the Demon's child at the stage of Transcendence

149
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
could do it.

150
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
I could only exhaust my Golden Core

151
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,590
to temporarily seal this source of all demons in the mortal world.

152
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,510
Su Yishui,

153
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,730
if you still

154
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,480
have a sense of gratitude to me,

155
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,570
just promise me one thing.

156
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,350
I've sealed the Spirit Spring at Wangxiang Pass.

157
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,750
Please return it to the netherworld for me.

158
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,310
Where's the Spirit Spring?

159
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,480
Master said she sealed the Spirit Spring here.

160
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
Why is it gone?

161
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,520
Are you alright?

162
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,030
I can't sense

163
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,630
any trace of demonic energy.

164
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,270
This indicates that the Spirit Spring

165
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,530
is still well-sealed.

166
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,030
For some unknown reason,

167
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,290
it has been relocated.

168
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,500
In your current state,

169
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,310
you'd better

170
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,880
go into seclusion and recuperate.

171
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't end up losing your life

172
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,030
without finding the Spirit Spring.

173
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,680
After 18 years,

174
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
how will you protect Master?

175
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,040
[Mount Wester]

176
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,020
With this Reincarnation Tree,

177
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,680
you still need to use half a Golden Core

178
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,310
and a fraction of your spiritual soul as a guide

179
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,240
to ensure her safe reincarnation.

180
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
Do you know that?

181
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

182
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,920
But are you willing to

183
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,200
fail her final wish?

184
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,070
Only the Demon's child at the stage of Transcendence

185
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,440
can seal the Spirit Spring back into the netherworld.

186
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,640
But with only nine-tenths of your spiritual sense remaining,

187
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,410
you'll never be able to advance to the stage of Transcendence.

188
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,200
Reviving her or fulfilling her wish,

189
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,750
you can only choose one.

190
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,480
I beg you to grant me a way to achieve both.

191
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,070
A way to achieve both

192
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,400
is nothing more than a temporary solution

193
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,720
in exchange for your suffering.

194
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,790
Please.

195
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,010
My twelve-petaled Ice Lotus

196
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,340
is the purest.

197
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,030
If you use the Ice Lotus to complete the incomplete core,

198
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,770
you should be able to regain the power of Transcendence.

199
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,440
However, to incorporate the Ice Lotus into your technique,

200
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,350
you must cultivate it without emotions.

201
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,270
Otherwise, when your seven emotions are disturbed,

202
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,960
the technique will backfire.

203
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,540
If you experience extreme emotions,

204
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,880
or give up completely to natural impulse,

205
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,510
causing the Ice Lotus Technique to break,

206
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,510
you'll suffer extreme pain.

207
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,550
And then

208
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,830
you'll lose the power of Transcendence.

209
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,890
If you still want to fulfill her wish,

210
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,240
you can only do so

211
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,130
by sacrificing your life to seal the Spirit Spring.

212
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,030
I won't go down

213
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,290
such a desperate path.

214
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Hopefully not.

215
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,070
Remember,

216
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,030
in the future,

217
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,030
Mu Qingge will be a brand new person,

218
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,930
and you, Su Yishui,

219
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,420
will become emotionless.

220
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,550
When you return

221
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,680
in 18 years,

222
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,240
no one will be able to hurt you.

223
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,110
[18 years later]
[Xue Village near Mount Absolute]

224
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,820
They say that right before her death,

225
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,580
this demoness even cursed her disciple,

226
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,410
Su Yishui,

227
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,060
with the Face-and-Heart Burning Curse.

228
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,060
It was utterly humiliating.

229
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,890
Her cruelty didn't end here.

230
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,530
Mu Qingge

231
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,820
merged her fate

232
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,500
with the sovereign order

233
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,650
of Wester Sect.

234
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,460
If she dies,

235
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,780
the disciples of Wester Sect will die!

236
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,850
What a vicious demon!

237
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,460
So Su Yishui had no choice

238
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,260
but to find a Reincarnation Tree

239
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,290
and a trace of her remaining soul.

240
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,430
With half of his Golden Core,

241
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,790
he helped her be reborn,

242
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,830
in hopes that with her return,

243
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,460
her curse on Wester Sect would be broken

244
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,390
and she'd help him

245
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,730
locate the missing Spirit Spring.

246
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,990
Sovereign Su

247
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,420
is such an upright and honorable man,

248
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,630
yet he had to extend a demon's life.

249
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,820
What an abominable pity!

250
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,210
So how long

251
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,290
does it take to

252
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,730
resurrect that demoness?

253
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,900
Eighteen years.

254
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,460
Mu Qingge

255
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,020
is coming back soon!

256
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,440
Dear audience,

257
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,610
the tales of Mount Wester

258
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,210
will end here today!

259
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,700
If you're worried that the demoness

260
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,850
will harm the mortal world,

261
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,200
why don't you get prepared?

262
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,020
I have portraits

263
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,870
of the righteous demon-slaying sovereign,

264
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,700
Su Yishui, available for purchase.

265
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,820
One cash for one.

266
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,380
It'll subdue evil

267
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,710
and keep your home safe.

268
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,270
Anyone interested?

269
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,580
Grab one while you can.

270
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,290
Old Li.

271
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,840
Who'd want to buy that?

272
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,070
In my opinion,

273
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,290
that man's so heartless

274
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,620
for killing his master.

275
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,090
He's no saint.

276
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,920
-What are you talking about?
-Watch your words!

277
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,350
Killing your master for justice is noble.

278
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,340
Su Yishui

279
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,500
will attain ascension sooner or later.

280
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,700
Slandering him will bring you bad luck!

281
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,150
You're the unlucky one!

284

Let's go.

285
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,090
We need to get back to work.

I'm an orphan.

According to the man who found me when I was little,

297
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,260
I floated along the river

298
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,410
to Xue Village.

299
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,530
I grew up

300
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,140
eating my neighbors' food.

301
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,650
They all say I might be

302
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,260
a glutton in my previous life

303
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,170
for me to be so gifted

304

in this life.

305
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,460
As long as I've smelled it,

306
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,530
I can cook it.

307
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,170
I like the world in a dish,

308
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,110
but I yearn to see the outside world even more.

309
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,390
I hope I'll get to taste

310
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,660

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,340

314
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,430
I don't know where it came from,

315
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,610
but we've relied

316

But as I grew up,

319
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,470
Ling Xiao became less and less energetic.

I've to go to town

517
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,690
to find Mr. Yu's immortal master

518
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,420
to save them.

519
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,270
Who's there?

520
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,889
Leave! Leave!

521
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,780
I'm afraid premature Fruits

522
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,890
are neither fully in the Yin or Yang Realms

523
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,570
and have unstable souls.

524
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,130
I won’t let you escape.

525
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,410
What's going on?

526
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,090
Go.

527
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,220
Get her back here.

528
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,220
Yes.

529
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,470
Shoo, evil spirit!

530
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,580
Are you afraid of me?

531
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,270
Oh no.

532
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,280
This evil spirit is so powerful.

533
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,500
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

534
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,450
Go look for the one who made you die

535
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,650
beyond recognition.

536
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,890
It's not my fault.

537
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,510
You don't remember anything?

538
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,510
Su Yishui of Wester Sect?

539
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,410
You treacherous loser.

540
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,410
How dare you

541
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,690
steal someone from us

542
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,690
with a face full of shameful marks?

543
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,850
Since you recognized me,

544
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,510
-you must die.
-Scarlet Sect?

545
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,340
Su Yishui?

546
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,300
Is he the heartless one

547
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,830
in the storyteller's story

548
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,130
who even killed

549
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,650
his own master?

550
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,740
Isn't that scarier than evil spirits?

551
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,980
Well...

552
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,450
Sorry for offending you.

553
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,510
I need to find an immortal master to save the people.

554
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,610
Goodbye.

555
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,330
The demonic energy invaded her bones?

556
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,500
Ling Xiao, come back!

557
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,260
It hurts...

558
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,670
What are you doing?

559
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,410
It hurts...

560
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,930
She actually has a broken heart.

561
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,500
Guardian, she's lucky you disguised her appearance

562
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,380
[Ranran's home, Xue Village]

563
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,470
so the Scarlet Sect didn't get her.

564
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,170
I thought you

565
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,500
sacrificing half of your Golden Core

566
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,780
to revive that demoness

567
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,410
would lift

568
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,850
the curses on you and Wester Sect.

569
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,780
I never imagined

570
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,780
that she'd be reborn

571
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,070
with an Incomplete Spirit Root

572
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,130
who can't even withstand

573
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,020
this little demonic energy from a secondary beast.

574
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,740
She fell off the Tree

575
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,850
before being fully

576
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,020
nourished,

577
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,760
so her heart's broken.

578
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,780
It's a sign of premature aging.

579
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,820
She is lucky that she's lived

580
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,650
until now.

581
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,580
If she dies,

582
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,910
who can lift your curse?

583
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,980
How about infusing her with power?

584
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,500
I tried.

585
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,660
I can't access her heart.

586
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,750
Could it be that

587
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,690
since she was your master in her previous life

588
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,740
and your master-disciple pact

589
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,470
was carried on to her next life,

590
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,300
so you're not allowed access

591
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,160
into her heart?

592
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,340
The master-disciple pact is a blood pact.

593
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,450
It can only be suppressed with another

594
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,110
blood pact.

595
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,680
Of the six pacts, the master-disciple pact is superior

596
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,940
and never to be broken.

597
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,130
In this world,

598
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,130
what other blood pact

599
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,370
could override it?

600
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,620
There's one.

601
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,060
Another master-disciple pact.

602
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,780
Wait.

603
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,220
You want to...

604
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,690
Take her as my disciple

605
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,350
to nullify the original pact.

606
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,300
Guardian.

607
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,450
Becoming the master of your master?

608
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,170
It's such a bold

609
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,220
and creative...

610
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,570
and deviant method.

611
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,530
Guardian.

612
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,290
Why don't you reconsider it?

613
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,650
There hasn't been such a precedent

614
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,930
in the cultivation world.

615
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,020
You've to endure the pressure of the laws of nature.

616
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,150
I doubt you'd even be

617
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,150
able to defy her.

618
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,370
Besides,

619
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,670
a lot goes into

620
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
being a master.

621
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,510
You've never been a master.

622
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,660
Can you do it?

623
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,470
Is it that hard?

624
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,660
Since you've decided,

625
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,940
let's return to Mount Wester

626
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,000
and make it happen.

627
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,890
Not yet.

628
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,780
Her Fruit fell prematurely.

629
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,710
She'll die instantly

630
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,510
when she's too far from the Tree.

631
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,410
She has never left Mount Absolute.

632
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,340
Go to Mount Absolute

633
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
and break off a branch from the Tree.

634
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,680
One more thing.

635
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,170
I can't confront Wei Jiu directly.

636
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,710
Inform the Four Sects.

637
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:20,690
Got it.

638
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,850
Xue Ranran's Spirit Root is incomplete,

639
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,450
but it's actually formless.

640
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,410
She's like

641
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,470
an Immortal Fruit.

642
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,000
We mustn't let the Scarlet Sect get her.

643
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,260
Formless Spirit Root?

644
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,710
Immortal Fruit?

645
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,640
She must stay in Mount Wester.

646
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,300
Go on.

647
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:34,760
Yes.

648
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,250
So he didn't save me by accident.

649
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,090
He's been targeting me.

650
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,610
Just like the demonic cultivators,

651
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,240
the Westers want to eat me!

652
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,490
You're awake.

653
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,660
Why are his face tattoos

654
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,540
gone?

655
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,250
What's wrong?

656
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,020
Do I look very scary?

657
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,430
No, no.

658
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,130
Your profile is

659
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,020
so gorgeous that I can't help but stare.

660
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,480
It's far from being scary.

661
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,240
Really?

662
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,150
It's rare that someone's not afraid

663
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,080
of my true face.

664
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,540
It must be fate.

665
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,340
I'll take you as my disciple.

666
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,260
No, no.

667
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,510
I have something urgent to attend to.

668
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,890
You must've got the wrong person.

669
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,090
It's definitely you.

670
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,300
Born on September 9 in the Year of Qinggeng.

671
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,910
You had a plum blossom mole on your face,

672
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,740
which disappeared when you were five.

673
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,870
You're destined with the Wester Sect.

674
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,740
You're great at reading fortunes, huh?

675
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,200
But the immortal path is too elusive.

676
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,530
It's not the life I want.

677
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,300
If you don't go up the mountain with me,

678
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,090
you'll die of heart failure soon.

679
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,500
Trying to scare me, huh?

680
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,690
That's my fate then.

681
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,500
You don't have to worry about it.

682
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,580
Your life is mine.

683
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,170
If I don't let you die,

684
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,120
you can't die.

685
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,020
Why are you forcing me?

686
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,650
It's a Wester tradition to force discipleship.

687
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,370
Back in the days,

688
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,630
my master did the same.

689
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,930
Is it that odd?

690
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,620
Aren't you a righteous sect?

691
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,650
Who said Mount Wester is a righteous sect?

692
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,650
The Westers only follow their own way.

693
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,850
Whether it's righteous or evil,

694
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,710
we do as we will.

695
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,220
This is the jade tablet of Wester disciples.

696
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,400
You have to drop your blood into it

697
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,080
and perform

698
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,910
a discipleship ceremony.

699
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,370
No thanks...

700
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,600
The fortune teller

701
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,820
said I'm born a jinx to my family

702
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,220
and teachers.

703
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,840
It's for your own good.

704
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,690
Kneel and take me as your master.

705
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,510
What's wrong with you?

706
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,740
How can you get others to kneel?

707
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,890
Will you kneel if I ask you to?
