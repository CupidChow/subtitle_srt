1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,220
Oh My People

2
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,940
It's destined to be a perfect match

3
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,460
But I'm still fearless and fearless

4
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,780
Waiting for the flowers to bloom

5
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,620
I still want to be with you

6
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,140
And slowly get to know you

7
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Ocean of Emotions

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
Episode 16

9
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
Oh no, oh no

10
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
What a shadowy Suyi Water

11
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
It's going to start to train me

12
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,220
So flammable

13
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,220
It's really going to make me a big ball and a big bomb

14
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,220
Master

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
Don't let it grow too fast

16
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,220
It's becoming my little life

17
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm going to be a little more fierce

18
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm willing to grow up with you

19
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,220
What is this black magic

20
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
What

21
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Ling Xiao

22
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,220
What did you do

23
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,220
I'm not in much pain anymore

24
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Don't ever break the wall

25
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,220
Don't worry

26
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,220
I can pull it out

27
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,220
I will definitely

28
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,220
Save you

29
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
I thought it was you and me

30
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,220
When I saw you

31
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
I got an answer from you

32
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Eighteen years

33
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,220
I'm still waiting for your answer

34
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,220
But you've forgotten everything

35
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
I'm waiting for you to remember

36
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
The debt you owed me

37
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Eighteen years

38
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,220
I'm still waiting for your answer

39
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,220
Eighteen years

40
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
I'm still waiting for your answer

41
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Eighteen years

42
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
I'm still waiting for your answer

43
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm still waiting for your answer

44
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
It's the same as our plan

45
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Xue Ran Ran has entered the West Mountain

46
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Re-marry Su Yi Shui

47
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,220
To be the apprentice of the old master

48
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Su Yi Shui

49
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
The great business that we didn't do eight years ago

50
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,420
is finally about to start.

51
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,740
Elder Tu,

53
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,860
you still haven't found the person I want?

54
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,340
Your Majesty, please calm down.

55
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,900
The one who can take the Fiery Immortal Fruit

56
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,220
is only Jiuhua,

57
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,620
the Five Great Clans,

58
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,180
the One-man Hall of the Capital,

59
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,820
the Five Great Clans,

60
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,620
and the One-man Hall of the Capital.

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,100
I'll send someone to investigate.

62
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,940
No need.

63
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,660
If you can't do it,

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,500
don't come here.

65
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,340
Just listen to my arrangement.

66
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,380
Yes.

67
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,820
Brother, are you okay?

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,700
Where is Master going to take you?

69
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,900
There is a West Wind Valley behind the house.

70
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,860
There is a big charcoal furnace.

71
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,700
Did you offend Master?

72
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,780
Why is Master so strict with you?

73
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,740
I want to eat meat buns.

74
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,740
I'm so hungry.

75
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,660
You want to eat and drink even you're on the mountain?

76
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,500
As the saying goes,

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,260
the one who loses his temper will live in the life of the God.

78
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,420
The one who doesn't lose his temper will die in the life of the God.

79
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,220
You can't even lose your temper.

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,580
Then why did you go to the mountain?

81
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,180
You think I want to?

82
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,900
I...

83
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,220
Forget it.

84
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,660
It's my own business to fight with Master.

85
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,740
I can't drag everyone down.

86
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,340
Ran Ran, what are you afraid of?

87
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,620
What?

88
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,140
I can smell the emotions.

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,340
The wind that blows on you

90
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,500
is like the smell of a fire.

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,620
It's a nervous and scary feeling.

92
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,980
I think

93
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,700
the West Mountain is really evil.

94
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,900
Master killed his master.

95
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,140
Aren't you afraid?

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,700
How dare you forget your master behind your back?

97
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,020
This witch

98
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,540
looks so good when she sees Master.

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,180
She's forcing him to go up the mountain.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,940
Master suffered from witch's torture.

101
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,620
She hates the evil spirit.

102
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,940
She doesn't even dare to kill him?

103
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,860
Master used to be beautiful.

104
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,460
Mom.

105
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,500
You're so annoying.

106
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,100
Did you focus on the wrong thing?

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
The point is,

108
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,300
Master was cursed by the witch

109
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,900
for the sake of the people.

110
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,180
So he was ruined.

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,540
A person can't do anything

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,140
even if he's stupid for the sake of the right path.

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
You're wrong.

114
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,300
Master.

115
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,140
Your master is a bit cold-hearted,

116
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,540
but he's a good person.

117
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,940
This is the tonic from Master.

118
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,420
Master may be a bit harsh,

119
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,820
but he'll know his pain

120
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,340
in time.

121
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,940
Master.

122
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,660
Wei Zhou didn't give up.

123
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
He's still searching for it.

124
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,940
I heard there's a kind of black glue

125
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,940
that can cover the spirit energy.

126
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,340
Check

127
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,020
where the black glue dragon is.

128
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,380
Yes.

129
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,100
I also heard

130
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,100
that you asked the witch

131
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,540
to go to the West Wind Valley to practice.

132
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,940
Isn't it a good chance

133
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,180
to use such a good place

134
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,180
to practice for her?

135
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
Her spirit energy is more than

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,940
my expected.

137
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm sure she'll be able to

138
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,100
send down the í†µ

139
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,380
after transforming to a poison energy.

140
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:32,900
However,

141
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,580
there isn't the wine

142
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,820
available on Xizhan.

143
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,180
But Master had said

144
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,900
I heard that the wine bottle that Mu Qing Ge used to drink

145
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,420
is in this kitchen.

146
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,220
I happen to have learned the magic of

147
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,420
taking things out of the box today.

148
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,100
Why don't I try

149
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,820
to get some wine bottles?

150
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,020
The heart is filled with thoughts.

151
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,100
Thoughts follow the heart.

152
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,900
Come on.

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,220
What's going on?

154
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm and I gotta go.

155
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
This is great.

156
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,940
ModernSekiro is myself.

157
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,900
Stay about me as you please.

158
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,100
Hmm?

159
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,660
That looks like it.

160
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,940
No way.

161
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,340
Here we go.

162
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,500
This is her ring of life

163
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
and her spiritual power

164
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,020
has made a difference.

165
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,780
Keeps me in your mind

166
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,620
I'll follow your heart.

167
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,700
Come on.

168
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,540
The wine made by the Demon of Rain

169
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,140
is very fragrant and rich.

170
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,820
It can be used for a long time.

171
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,540
Wu Shi, you can leave now.

172
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,420
Yes.

173
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,500
Wait.

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,180
You can only call her Xue Ran Ran from now on.

175
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,740
Yes.

176
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
The Demon of Rain has moved.

177
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,980
There's a change in the Spirit Spring.

178
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,380
Back then,

179
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
we tried our best to control the Demon of Rain.

180
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,780
But she didn't have the Spirit Spring.

181
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
For so many years,

182
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
the Demon of Rain

183
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,660
hasn't even detected the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

184
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,340
The Spirit Spring that was lost last night.

185
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
It's a pity that

186
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,780
the Spirit Spring has gone in a flash.

187
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
It's hard to track where the Spirit Spring is.

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,900
We don't know where the

189
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,620
mysterious Mu Qing Ge

190
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,180
has hidden the Spirit Spring.

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,340
The Immortal Fruit of Mount Xue has fallen.

192
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,340
If the Demon of Rain shows up again,

193
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,100
the Spirit Spring will be summoned again.

194
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,020
The world will be in chaos.

195
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,060
The barrier of Mount Xue

196
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,460
was built by Su Yi Shui.

197
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,900
The

198
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,540
cave of Mount Xue Xuxuan is hidden.

199
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,140
Master.

200
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,180
Clan Leader Su.

201
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,460
We're here today

202
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,060
for the sake of Mount Xue.

203
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,700
Have you been to Mount Xue?

204
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,620
No.

205
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,540
Yi Shui,

206
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,500
here's the thing.

207
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,460
A few days ago,

208
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,740
Wei Jiu and his people

209
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,020
made a scene at Mount Xue.

210
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,780
The Demon of Rain

211
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,180
sensed the change in the Spirit Spring.

212
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
Everyone was worried

213
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,060
that the Immortal Platform of Mount Xue was suspicious.

214
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,660
The barrier of Mount Xue is not valid.

215
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,740
Mu Qing Ge hasn't come back to life yet.

216
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,980
The change in the Spirit Spring has nothing to do with it.

217
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,220
You built the barrier.

218
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,860
You also built the Water Mirror.

219
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
How do you prove it?

220
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,220
Yan Liao Yue.

221
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Say a few words.

222
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,780
Don't be so anxious to protect her.

223
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,140
The change in the Spirit Spring

224
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,380
concerns the safety of the world.

225
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,540
Today,

226
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,780
either give a more satisfying answer

227
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,540
or follow us to Mount Xue

228
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,340
to open the barrier and check it out.

229
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm not going to let you go.

230
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
The barrier is extended on the spot.

231
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,380
Don't try to fool us.

232
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,260
Why do you come here?

233
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,060
Just go to Mount Xue and guard it.

234
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,980
You...

235
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,780
You've been

236
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,420
playing around in the room all day.

237
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Go to the heaven and fight with me.

238
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,300
You know what?

239
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,500
The Wen of Mount Kongshan Sect who came today

240
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,380
and our master 18 years ago

241
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,420
were a pair of golden girls.

242
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,580
They were crushed by our grandmaster

243
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,020
and were torn apart.

244
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,020
Grandmaster was cruel

245
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,540
and ruined Master Wen's reputation.

246
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,580
It's so exciting.

247
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
No.

248
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm not interested.

249
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,980
I made the wine

250
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,820
to open the barrier today.

251
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Behind this forest

252
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,420
is the forbidden area of our West Mountain.

253
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,300
No one is allowed to enter.

254
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,260
Isn't it where

255
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,780
the evil girl Mu Qing Ge's Lin Xi Palace is?

256
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,500
She died

257
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,300
and Lin Xi Palace built the barrier.

258
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
Everyone, come to my West Mountain as guests.

259
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,820
You should follow the rules of our West Mountain.

260
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,860
Rules?

261
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,340
It's up to you.

262
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,700
The closer you are to Lin Xi Palace, the less your spiritual power.

263
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,740
That's why you built the barrier here.

264
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,180
You're all useless.

265
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,700
Get out of my way.

266
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,380
What did you say?

267
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,700
Useless?

268
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,260
You'll know if you're useless in one try.

269
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,100
You said I'm useless.

270
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,060
Stop!

271
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,300
They're not as good as you.

272
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,380
You've lost.

273
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,940
Why are you pushing me?

274
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,780
Little girl,

275
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,700
you want to help them?

276
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,380
Fine.

277
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,620
Let's try it.

278
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,100
Senior. Senior.

279
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,100
Senior.

280
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,820
Junior?

281
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,580
Junior?

282
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,740
I won't allow you to play dirty tricks here.

283
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,380
Sun present is

284
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,580
Let go of my disciple!

285
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,780
Ye Lang Yu!

286
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,980
Let go!

287
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,580
Yishui!

288
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Let them go!

289
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
You!

290
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,380
Go away!

291
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,580
Go!

292
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,580
Go!

293
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,580
Go!

294
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,580
Go!

295
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,580
Go!

296
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,380
Go!

297
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,380
Go!

298
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,380
Go!

299
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,380
Go!

300
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,380
Go!

301
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Go!

302
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
You're so stubborn.

303
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
You're weak,

304
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,180
but you can't ignore it.

305
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,380
You...

306
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,980
I'll punish you if you want.

307
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,980
Don't say anything.

308
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,780
Stay there.

309
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,980
You have to stay here for two hours.

310
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
What good can the God of Sand do?

311
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,980
He's just protecting his own tonic.

312
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,980
Ice is cold and cold.

313
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,380
Everything is quiet.

314
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,380
My heart is cold and cold.

315
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,780
I'm not afraid of anything.

316
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
It's so cold.

317
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,580
The ice array is here.

318
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,180
It's almost the last step.

319
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,180
Ling Xiao?

320
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Ling Xiao!

321
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,580
There are still chances.

322
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,180
I can't give up.

323
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,380
My heart is cold.

324
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,180
The God of Heaven is looking at me.

325
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm so kind.

326
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm so kind.

327
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,980
Being a ropeworm confuses the god of light and wealth,

328
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,780
but he doesn't stand a chance.

329
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,780
How do you know?

330
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Even the mud put on the earth

331
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,180
is worse than your feet.

332
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,380
You even know what's'm right...

333
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,580
but you took a Copter to hunting.

334
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,300
Don't you know

335
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,380
being a wolf when you're elegant is send a rep Task?

336
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,340
younger daughter.

337
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,880
Go to the ore

338
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,180
and bring me something

339
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,660
for her to stay under the cliff.

340
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,860
Yes, Brener.

341
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,860
You didn't behave earnestly

342
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,880
or try to fishes the land.

343
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,400
Having a meager limbs is not a honor.

344
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't feel myself 83dApplause

345
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,300
What is so strange

346
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,180
about the sword that has being hidden in the men's army.

347
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm just curious.

348
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,860
But the sword of the master is famous.

349
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,940
Every night, he needs to know

350
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,780
the music of the moon on the hairpin of the Wangyou Pavilion.

351
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,820
At this time, the God of Sand

352
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,940
will go to the ice lotus pond in the yard to play.

353
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,860
He's really not here.

354
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,100
Here you are, peace charming.

355
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,700
You pledge allegiance to family name Mingå¸Œæœ›

356
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,500
Lin Xiang

357
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,140
Every time you come near Abyssinia

358
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,580
You can recover some strength

359
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,500
Lin Xiang

360
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
I hid a dress

361
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:40,680
Gao D emprese

362
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,420
You put it here

363
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,600
It's okay

364
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
What a pity, my good wine.

365
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Sorry, master.

366
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
I... I... I went to the wrong room.

367
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
It's a mirror.

368
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
According to the spiritual treasure,

369
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,120
the mirror can be passed on to any place you want to go.

370
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
The mirror can be passed on to any place you want to go.

371
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
According to the spiritual treasure,

372
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
the mirror can be passed on to any place you want to go.

373
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
The body is beautiful.

374
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I heard that he is also a handsome man

375
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
who is as beautiful as the moon.

376
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Before the death of Mu Qingge,

377
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
he used four-sided acupuncture to cover his whole body

378
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
to become like this.

379
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
What a pity.

380
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
These two people are really in love with each other.

381
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

382
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

383
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

384
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

385
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

386
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
It's hard to believe that they're dead.

387
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Xue Ranran,

388
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
you're in a mess at this moment.

389
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,720
You'll be fine if you get the blood jade water and run away immediately.

390
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Xue Ranran,

391
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
why did you come to my room?

392
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
I shouldn't have entered your room.

394
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I just want to take back this brocade.

395
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
You know Su Yu?

396
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
How did you know him?

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Does he know Mr. Yu?

398
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I met him by chance.

399
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
By chance?

400
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
His brocade is so important to you?

401
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
If he doesn't believe this reason,

402
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
he'll never have the chance to see me come for the blood jade water.

403
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm willing to do so,

404
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
but Mr. Yu is my sweetheart.

405
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Your sweetheart?

406
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
So I don't want to leave him.

407
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Master.

408
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Master.

409
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
You did something wrong, didn't you?

410
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
You can't drink.

411
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
You just need to soak in the wine.

412
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
It's really good to go to the Ruo Qing mansion.

413
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Master is usually boring.

414
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Why don't you get drunk and have a good time?

415
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Drunk and drunken, live a good life.

416
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Thank you.

417
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Brother Qi.

418
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Why did I switch the enchantment at night?

419
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
I can't find the way to go down the mountain.

420
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Luckily I got the jade butterfly.

421
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Give me the jade butterfly.

422
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Give me the jade butterfly.

423
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Xiao Bai, I'm really running out of time.

424
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
When the God of Sand wakes up, I'll chase after him.

425
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Xiao Bai, do you know the way to go down the mountain?

426
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you know the way to go down the mountain?

427
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,720
If you take me away, I'll give you all the meat.

428
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
The Lin Xi Palace of the Demoness.

429
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Do I go down the mountain from here?

430
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I'll go down the mountain from here.

431
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
The nine books.

432
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
The ten books.

433
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
The ten books.

434
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
The eight books.

435
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
You're really good at it.

436
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,720
People like him say he's a strong man.

437
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
He's a man of his word.

438
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
But the interview is called...

439
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
It doesn't count.

440
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
The map of the Western Mountain.

441
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
The fire.

442
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
The Heart Wrapping Spell.

443
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
The one who is cursed...

444
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,720
will either forgive the one who is suffering...

445
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,720
or the one who is not.

446
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
So...

447
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
The God of Sand took my Immortal Spirit Root...

448
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
and practiced flying.

449
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Then I can remove his Heart Wrapping Spell.

450
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
No wonder he wants to take me up the mountain.

451
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I have to leave now.

452
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Let me see.

453
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,720
The moon flies in the night.

454
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,720
The sky is covered with clouds.

455
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Tears are in my eyes.

456
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,720
I cry out for you.

457
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I want to return to you.

458
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
You're back.

459
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
What's going on?

460
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Is he drunk and unconscious?

461
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
What's going on?

462
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm leaving.

463
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Don't go.

464
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
The tree you planted has grown.

465
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
It blooms and withers every year.

466
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
You haven't tasted it.

467
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
You're crazy.

468
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Xu Ran Ran.

469
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Master.

470
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
You're really back.

471
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
You're from the same hospital.

472
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Don't forget me.

473
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
You must recognize him.

474
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
He's the one who killed the enemy.

475
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Xu Ran Ran.

476
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Stop.

477
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
It seems that the more he gets angry,

478
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
the more the spirit sword in the hall will target him.

479
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Su Wei Shui.

480
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Don't think I don't know...

481
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
what you're thinking about me.

482
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Everyone says you're arrogant and noble.

483
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I think it's all nonsense.

484
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Do you dare to say...

485
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
why you lied to me about going up the mountain?

486
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
You clearly want to take away my Immortal Spirit Root...

487
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
and help you practice.

488
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Why do you know about the Immortal Spirit Root?

489
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
If I don't know,

490
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
I won't let you succeed...

491
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
unless you try your best.

492
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I'll run far away...

493
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
and make you never find it again.

494
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
You can't leave.

495
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
You'll die if you leave the mountain.

496
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I'll die if I stay here.

497
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
You even dare to kill your master.

498
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
What else can't you do?

499
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Your master gave you...

500
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
the Heart-stabbing Curse.

501
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
You should take it.

502
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
You even want to get rid of the curse.

503
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Go to sleep.

504
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Xu Ran Ran.

505
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Xu Ran Ran.

506
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Xu Ran Ran.

507
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Greetings, Honorable Superior.

508
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
The item has arrived.

509
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Do you want to use this as a barrier...

510
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
to turn into Fruit-eating Sea?

511
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Although this spell is powerful,

512
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
if that girl is in the hands of a few Xuan Men,

513
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
there must be a barrier in the Xuan Men Immortal Mountain.

514
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm afraid that the spell will be blocked.

515
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
That's your uselessness.

516
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I've already entered the top of the Cloud Eagle.

517
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,720
How can I put the barrier in my eyes?

518
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
As long as there is a hair, a beard, and a flesh,

519
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
no matter if it's on the sky or on the ground,

520
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
I want to enter the stone sea.

521
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
It's just like a mortal world.

522
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Miss.

523
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Miss, wake up.

524
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I can only send you here.

525
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
If you want to go to the capital,

526
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
you have to get another carriage in the city.

527
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Miss, are you okay?

528
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I think you don't look very well.

529
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Maybe I was caught up in the night.

530
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
It should be quite far from the West Mountain.

531
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
It's about a hundred miles away.

532
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Thank you.

533
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
This is the mortal world.

534
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
What kind of broken Xuan Men Jade Flask is this?

535
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
It can hold ten taels of silver.

536
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Immortal Su, thank you.

537
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Why is there no taste?

538
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Why is this also tasteless?

539
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Did I lose my appetite

540
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
when I was washing the mortal world

541
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
in the West Mountain?

542
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
No.

543
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
I have to eat up all the mortal world's

544
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
food and water.

545
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
What's going on?

546
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Are you okay?

547
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Miss.

548
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Miss.

549
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Miss.

550
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Manager.

551
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
What's going on?

552
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
If she dies in our store...

553
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Manager, let's go report to the government.

554
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Let the government take care of this.

555
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Yes, yes, yes.

556
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Let's go.

557
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Let's go.

558
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Nonsense.

559
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I still have a lot of time.

560
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
I won't die.

561
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
What's wrong?

562
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Why is this happening?

563
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
You can't leave.

564
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
You will die if you leave the West Mountain.

565
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Is he not threatening me?

566
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
I really can't leave the West Mountain.

567
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I can't die.

568
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
I haven't been able to leave.

569
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I still have so many good things to do.

570
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I can't leave.

571
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I can't leave.

572
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I can't leave.

573
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I still have so many fun things to do.

574
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I can't die.

575
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Ice is cold and bones are cold.

576
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Everything is quiet.

577
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Ice is cold and bones are cold.

578
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Everything is quiet.

579
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
My heart is cold.

580
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Heaven is cruel.

581
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
My heart is cruel.

582
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
My heart is cruel.

583
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Heaven is cruel.

584
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I found it.

585
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
The water spirit is like a stone.

586
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
It's indeed the stone of the Twins.

587
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
I finally found it.

588
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Who is it?

589
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
It's you again.

590
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
How many times do I have to steal my medicine?

591
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
I will kill you.

592
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I will kill you.

593
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
The stone is ruined.

594
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Everyone is dead.

595
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
It's not my fault.

596
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
You damage all my entire family.

597
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
ca

598
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
This fruit's spirit energy

599
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
is not from the Private conversations98

600
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,880
private conversationsnt

601
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,080
The division is decided.

602
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,240
Oh, no!

603
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,240
The hair formation is the one who killed Qingyuan.

604
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,360
I didn't expect Wei Zhe would be capable now.

605
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,040
If we can't finish the transformation bone

606
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,160
I'm the same with the giant azalea in Shanran.

607
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
We can wrong the episodes.

608
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,700
Bring it back to me

609
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,200
since it's the ring of deathARS,

610
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
which will be my signature wear.

611
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,040
I can't play anymore!

612
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,200
communities areRhett

613
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,960
Don't worry

614
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,480
To help

615
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,440
Li S Actually

616
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,320
What have ours

617
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,960
Going crazy

618
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,920
I base

619
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,520
that

620
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
Itelectronic

622
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,960
Eating

623
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,680
Why would ever you banish a bird from its nest?

624
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
Here, drink these up.

625
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,820
we'd take care of each othericate

626
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,000
putting her at your Lane last year in the first place.

627
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:43,200
A brand new

628
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Will you go back to the West Mountain with me?

629
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
It's time to go back.

630
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,200
The wind blows in the night, the sky is empty.

631
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,200
The past is withering, and you don't come back.

632
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
The people are not beautiful, but the world is beautiful.

633
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
We drink to celebrate.

634
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I miss you, and I cry in this life.

635
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
The End

636
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Master, Mr. Zang is here.

637
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
The End

638
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
I haven't seen you for so long.

639
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
You are still as good as before.

640
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
You have been practicing the ice bow for years.

641
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
You are more like an ice rabbit.

642
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
You are not even a little bit hot.

643
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I am here to talk to you about something important.

644
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
I am not here to listen to your nonsense.

645
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
How is Master?

646
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Master, you really look like this.

647
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I can't recognize you.

648
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,200
According to your previous transmission, Master's body is dangerous.

649
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
What is going on?

650
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
He was born too early.

651
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,200
His spirit was broken when he was born.

652
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
He can only survive by using the power of the rotation.

653
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
If he is too far away, he will be in danger.

654
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
How could this happen?

655
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
And he ran down the mountain this time.

656
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
He was hit by a body.

657
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
There is something wrong with it.

658
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
That's why I asked you to use the spirit energy.

659
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
It will take a while.

660
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
I have asked Yu Tong about it.

661
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Since you brought Master to the West Mountain,

662
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
you have been cold to him.

663
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
You even threw him into the ice lotus pond.

664
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Even if you want to break through his meridians as soon as possible,

665
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
he has no spirit energy to fight back.

666
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
How can he survive?

667
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
I am his master and he is his disciple.

668
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
It's my business to teach him.

669
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Moreover, he used my power

670
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
to make our army lose.

671
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I am a man of my word.

672
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
How can I treat him like this?

673
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
It's been years.

674
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
You are getting more and more stubborn.

675
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Master said you would be born soon.

676
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
How could you do this?

677
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I will be born soon.

678
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
I will be born when I see the star-shaped curse.

679
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
You are so angry with him.

680
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
How could you give up your birth

681
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
and save him with half of the spirit energy?

682
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
You even made up a lie

683
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
to save the whole West Mountain.

684
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
It's ridiculous.

685
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
He died because of me.

686
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I owe him a life.

687
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
When he is stable enough,

688
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I will let him leave immediately.

689
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Who believes you?

690
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
You were so stubborn a few years ago.

691
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
You are still so stubborn.

692
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
If I talk about the past,

693
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I am afraid you can't even regret it.

694
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
I am sorry.

695
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
I am sorry.

696
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
I am sorry.

697
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I am sorry.

698
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
I am sorry.

699
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
I am sorry.

700
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
I am sorry.

701
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
I am sorry.

702
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
I am sorry.

703
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
I am sorry.

704
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I am sorry.

705
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
I am sorry.

706
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
I am sorry.

707
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I am sorry.

708
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
I am sorry.

709
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
I am sorry.

710
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
I am sorry.

711
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
I am sorry.

712
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
I am sorry.

713
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
I am sorry.

714
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
I am sorry.

715
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I am sorry.

716
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
I am sorry.

717
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I am sorry.

718
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,200
I am sorry.

719
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
I am sorry.

720

I am sorry.

721
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
I am sorry.

722
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
I am sorry.

723
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
I am sorry.

724
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
I am sorry.

725
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I am sorry.

726
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
I am sorry.

727
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
I am sorry.

728
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
I am sorry.

729
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
I am sorry.

730
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
I am sorry.

731
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
I am sorry.

732
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,200
I am sorry.

00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
I am sorry.

I am sorry.

I am sorry.

I am sorry.

I am sorry.

I am sorry.

751
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,200
I am sorry.

752
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
I am sorry.
