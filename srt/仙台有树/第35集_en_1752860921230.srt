1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,680
wasn't foolish enough to conspire against Her Highness.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,120
The M defining of The W Policy

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times,

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
travel to the north and west,

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if I know that I will return one day,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will be destined to lose myself.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I will not regret it.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The love and hate of the world.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The love and hate of the world.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Master!

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yaoshu!

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yaoshu!

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yaoshu!

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yaoshu!

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yaoshu!

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yaoshu!

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yaoshu!

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everything!

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The Star-Breaking River!

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Star-Breaking River?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mo Xi,

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
why?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why are you willing to break everything for her?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why?

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If I could meet someone like that back then,

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I would hate her so much!

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Royal Water Spirit has been used up.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why did Xiao San suddenly leave?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where else would he want to go?

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Rong Yao.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's you. Duan Tian, it's really you.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You shouldn't be like this.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's been hundreds of years.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hundreds of years!

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Have you ever thought about what I should have been like?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When you abandoned me and my daughter,

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
have you ever thought about what we would have become?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Duan Tian, you have regretted it.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shut up!

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I was the one who should have killed the King of the Fogs!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It wasn't because you wanted me to fight for the right path!

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I did it for justice.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I did it for the sake of the people!

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Back then, I thought about it twice.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I couldn't do it.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But now, I can get everything back!

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can make everything happen again!

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Get everything back?

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can't get everything back.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can't give up on the happiness and happiness you once had.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But now, you're just losing it forever!

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're not Rong Yao.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're not qualified to talk about it here.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're not qualified to talk about it here.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're not qualified to talk about it here.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Get lost!

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Get lost!

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I should have taken the medicine.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I should have taken the medicine.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Rong Yao,

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Rong Yao,

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Rong Yao, I can get everything back now.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can get everything back now.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will definitely reunite with my family.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Xiao Shui.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What did you call me?

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who told you to call me that?

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't be like your sister.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I should have told you the truth.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Actually, I...

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mu Qing Ge,

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
how dare you use your method to harm Ran Ran?

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're looking for death!

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not!

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm Mu Ran Wu!

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What did you say?

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's just that Mu Qing Ge's spirit and spirit roots are on me.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Forget it.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't you know who Mu Qing Ge really is?

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Didn't you see the spirit and spirit of the heart just now?

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In this world, besides Mu Qing Ge,

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
who else can use such a trick?

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's him who's been lying to you.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You finally figured it out.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Since you lost your memory,

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you can't just pretend that I've been lying to you.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The person you should be blaming is him!

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Even now,

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you're still like this.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I never thought that

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
our sisterhood

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
would actually fail like this.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't believe what she said.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I only listen to you.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm Mu Qing Ge.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You...

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You actually lied to me!

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You said that I should fall in love with you again.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
These are all your tricks to achieve your goal!

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're indeed the Mu Mei that I've been thinking about.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Whether it's in this life or in the next,

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you've been holding on to your little disciple.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Su Yi Shui,

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you haven't improved at all in the past 20 years.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You've been played around.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you excited?

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not like that.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then what is it?

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I did lie to you about my identity.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But I didn't mean to.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's because...

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because you've forgotten a lot of things.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know...

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can't make it up?

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Su Yi Shui,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I know my sister the best.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If she's determined to help the Emperor and be a good person,

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that's the most enjoyable thing.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In the past, many people were as caring as you.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When she was a teacher,

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
she was so obedient to you.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Now that she's a disciple,

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
she's been loved by you.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's really a fool!

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Whether it's Mu Qing Ge or Xue Ran Ran,

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
killing or punishing is my own business.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now she's my disciple.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How can I educate my own disciple?

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't need to see you people having fun.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh no!

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll go back to the set to find the fire of the crystal.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If I can't kill the demon,

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll be in trouble!

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hurry up! We must stop him!

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hurry up!

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You've been lying to me for so long.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mu Qing Ge, you're so capable.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did I lie to you about money or your color?

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're so wronged.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you had taken the soul-gathering talisman,

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you would have known my identity.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But I'm your teacher,

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but I'm your disciple.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Su Yi Shui, you're so treacherous!

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I...

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You must have used some trick.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll keep you by my side.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Fine, I used tricks.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I lied to you.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When everything is over, I'll leave.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We don't need to be teachers or disciples.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We can just break up.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How dare you!

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I...

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean, how can we break up

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
our grudges?

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
At least...

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll make you pay for it.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Su Yi Shui, you're so ungrateful.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So what if I'm Mu Qing Ge?

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I've raised you so well.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've given you enough time.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now,

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I remember our relationship.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's so bad.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Since you hate me so much,

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll ask the Nine Immortals to give me another soul-gathering talisman.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll also clean up your memory.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then,

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
we'll be strangers.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's over.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey!

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If I knew I wouldn't help this girl

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
to get rid of her old spirit,

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I wouldn't have asked her to get angry with me.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Master!

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you okay?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't call me master!

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then I should call you Shui.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Or,

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I should call you Mr. Su?

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you trying to remind me

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that I'm older than you?

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If I wanted to remind you of this,

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I wouldn't call you Mr. Su.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I would call you Uncle Su.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Uncle Su?

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You...

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You...

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Why did I

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
have to live with you

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
like a demoness?

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Forget it.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't want to talk to you.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go to the Golden Fire first.

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Uncle Ye Xin.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're like my daughter.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't bear to kill you.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But it's okay.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's all temporary.

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
After I complete the plan,

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will never treat you badly.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Plan?

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What do you want to do?

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I just

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
want to get my wife back

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and let everything

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
start over.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's nothing in this world

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that can make time go back

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and make the past come back.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you know that there are three thousand realms?

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Three thousand realms?

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Dun Tian once told me

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
that there are three thousand realms.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Each realm has a different us.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Dun Tian wants to go to

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
a world where he didn't choose to fly

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
or sacrifice his wife.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He wants to start over.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Three thousand realms is the way to the three thousand worlds.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Dun Tian wants to take the Golden Fire

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to imitate the King of the Human's Tomb

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and start the three thousand realms.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He doesn't want the Golden Fire.

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The King of the Human's Tomb

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
has created the Golden Fire

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to eliminate his evil spirit.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The King of the Human's Tomb

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
couldn't have used it.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Dun Tian must have a conspiracy

240
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to lure everyone to the Golden Fire.

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Luckily, the Golden Fire

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
is still in the Xuan Tian tribe.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I won't have to waste my time.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I found it.

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The Golden Fire.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I finally got it.

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Go back!

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't act rashly!

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It depends on whether you have the ability.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't hurt them.

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't let the soul master get hurt.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes!

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Go!

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Who is Su Ye?

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Master.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I asked Mo Zhi Xian

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
if he would agree to take the Golden Fire.

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Go!

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Watch out!

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Everyone, stop!

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Ran Ran!

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The King of the Human's Tomb

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
hasn't been completely destroyed.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The spirit power is the spirit stone of the King of the Human's Tomb.

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Xiao Shui is Mo Zi.

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Could it be that Dun Tian's purpose

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
is to...

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No!

269
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't touch the Golden Fire!

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's a trap!

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Break the barrier!

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Stop!

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
How did you get the Glazed Bead

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
from the Xuan Tian tribe?

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
How... how are you?

276
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've been...

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've been keeping my promise.

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You don't want to break the soul stone,

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but you want to get the Golden Fire.

280
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You just want to get the Golden Fire.

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I told you not to do anything.

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Do you think you can

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
just watch me

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and not let me

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
help you clean up the mess?

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're a mess.

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You've done a lot of work.

288
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you want?

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I don't mind.

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Even if you don't think about me.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've already fulfilled my promise.

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Please,

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Your Majesty, let me go.

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You...

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Still not working.

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Wei Jiu's power is so strong.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We can't break his barrier.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is wrong.

299
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no!

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The Demon King's skull!

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wei Jiu trapped us here

302
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
to use the evil aura to kill us.

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's the Night-Soul Skill.

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I have to get rid of it.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Try to seal it

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
when the evil aura comes in.

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm scared.

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's dangerous.

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't be afraid.

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm here.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm here.

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm here.

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Master.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Master.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Master.

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master.

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let go of him.

318
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yuan Ran.

319
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yuan Ran.

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yuan Ran, are you okay?

321
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's going on?

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stop struggling.

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The power that I have

324
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is the destiny of the Demon King.

325
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It seems that the evil aura

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
that the Demon King left

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
wants to take the Demon King's body.

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's stand up and suppress him.

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay. Everyone, stand up.

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Su Yi Shui.

331
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're so confused

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that you want to fight with me.

333
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you think it's useful?

334
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yuan Ran.

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Master.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I've already

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
dried the Chiyuan paper

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and cleared the passage

339
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
of the evil aura.

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Su Yi Shui.

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's the spiritual power

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
that you sealed.

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Xiao Shui.

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You're so stupid.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Xiao Shui.

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Stop.

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Wu Ying.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Su Yi Shui.

349
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The Demon King's

350
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
destiny is

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to let go of the Demon King.

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You all

353
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
should do whatever you want

354
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
in this world.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's so easy.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Now I'm one with the spirit bone.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I can be like this.

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
If you want to get rid of me,

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
then Su Yi Shui will be dead.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And you

361
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
can't kill me.

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll kill you today

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and kill you.

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Your body

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
hasn't been devoured by the demon.

366
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You haven't taken this body.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Master.

368
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Master.

369
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Master.

370
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Master.

371
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Master.

372
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Master.

373
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Master.

374
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Master.

375
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Master.

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Fan Yue.

377
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're so weak.

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Master.

379
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He's really possessed.

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So the Demon King

381
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
has escaped from the world.

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Where's the Demon King?

383
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Ran Ran.

384
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What happened?

385
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He reopened the seal.

386
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So the power of the spirit bone

387
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
has been in the Demon King's body.

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Please

389
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
work with me.

390
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Use the power of the Heavenly Emperor

391
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to seal this gap.

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't let the Demon King

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
take the body.

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This is the most important thing.

395
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's solve this first.

396
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The Demon King

397
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
has been saved.

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's time to go back.

399
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Master.

400
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Master.

401
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Master.

402
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Master.

403
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Master.

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Master.

405
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Master.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Master.

407
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Master.

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Master.

409
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Master.

410
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll wait for you.

411
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,280
Su Yishui, why are you fighting against me?

412
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,880
The people around you are angry with you, angry with you, and hiding from you.

413
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,600
Are you only worthy of being a pawn that they can settle?

414
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,440
Do you think they can manipulate you?

415
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
As the son of the devil,

416
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
you are born to be respected and strong.

417
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,920
You should be the sign of all the fates in this world.

418
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,280
Su Yishui,

419
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,040
you are the son of the devil.

420
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
You are the son of the devil.

421
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,240
You are the son of the devil.

422
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
You are the son of the devil.

423
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,880
You are the master of all fates.

424
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,000
Su Yishui, what's wrong with you?

425
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,080
Don't come any closer.

426
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,920
I've brought all the fuchsia seeds.

427
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
Just plant them.

428
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't come any closer.

429
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,480
I see.

430
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,520
You want to use the daughter of the devil to get rid of me.

431
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,600
Your spiritual power will also be taken away.

432
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
You'd rather be a loser

433
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
than save my life?

434
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,480
You...

435
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,280
You are Su Yishui who has been washed out.

436
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,520
You are the only link between you and her past self.

437
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
A little blood connection

438
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,680
and the experience of sharing the same blood and bones

439
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,680
will make her believe in you.

440
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
The devil is as good as nothing.

441
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,040
Even if she is a little scared,

442
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,720
she will be swallowed by the devil

443
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,480
without any certainty or anxiety.

444
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,440
She will be led to the devil by the devil.

445
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,720
Why do you waste your energy?

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
You...

447
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,240
Yue Chen.

448
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,800
You are not Su Xiaoxiao.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,240
Of course I am not the Su Xiaoxiao

450
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
who has full hope for you.

451
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
I came back from hell.

452
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,440
You abandoned me.

453
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
I hate you.

454
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
You forgot the promise you made to me.

455
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
You forgot the promise you made to me.

456
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,240
You said that everyone can only be under your feet.

457
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,360
But what happened?

458
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
Why did you give up your promise?

459
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,200
For what?

460
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,800
For a woman to give up everything.

461
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,520
Do you believe in this nonsense?

462
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,040
I don't believe it.

463
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
How we suffered

464
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,240
and were hurt so much

465
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
have you forgotten it?

466
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,360
What did I do for?

467
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,400
Only useless people ask why.

468
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,800
To be me, to be the strongest and the most respected.

469
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,760
You are the only answer in the world.

470
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
Brother.

471
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Brother.

472
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,560
I finally could rest my body.

473
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
It was Frei Dantian who set this up.

474
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm not sure where he is.

475
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,920
I have a big plan to settle this.

476
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,320
All the things that happened

477
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
and what we have been speculating on

478
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
are all these.

479
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
What is the Three Thousand Towers?

480
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
The Demon King destroyed it for hundreds of years.

481
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,720
There are no records about the Three Thousand Towers.

482
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
People only know

483
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
that it's a demon tower that destroyed the heaven and earth.

484
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,920
But they don't know

485
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,720
that it's related to the Heaven-resisting Spell you mentioned.

486
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,720
This is the information I collected from the Three Thousand Towers.

487
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
In fact, the Heaven and Earth are so small

488
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
that it's not only the world that we live in and know.

489
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,520
There are three thousand worlds.

490
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
There are you and me in each of them.

491
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
There are all living beings in each of them.

492
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,320
So if we say that the Demon King wants to revive his wife and children,

493
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,320
it's better to say that he wants to go to another world

494
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,520
and find the origin of his wife and children

495
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
and start over.

496
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
So,

497
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
the way to connect the Three Thousand Towers

498
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
is the Three Thousand Towers.

499
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,920
This is a game against the heavens.

500
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
It requires huge energy and a very high price.

501
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,920
To open the Three Thousand Towers,

502
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,320
we have to use all the dangers in this world.

503
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
That's why I said that the Three Thousand Towers

504
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
will destroy the heaven and earth.

505
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
You mean

506
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,120
that the Heaven and Earth will destroy this world we live in?

507
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Do you

508
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,920
believe what he said?

509
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Elder Yan,

510
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,920
is Dun Tian your ancestor of the Jiuhua Sect?

511
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Dun Tian is a very capable person.

512
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
He was a man of many years ago.

513
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,920
I don't know his character.

514
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
But I and Junior Wen,

515
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
with Miss Xue and Clan Leader Su,

516
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
have traveled around the world together

517
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
and seen many things.

518
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
So I won't question their relationship anymore.

519
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,720
You should also make your judgment.

520
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,720
Now, this is a matter of my Xuanmen Qi heart.

521
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
I just don't know

522
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,920
how to open the Three Thousand Towers.

523
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,520
What should we do

524
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,120
to stop his plan?

525
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:17,880
This is the

526
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Destruction Technique.

527
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,720
It's a skill that all mortals

528
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,120
can't compete with.

529
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,920
Moreover,

530
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,520
there are demons and demons around him.

531
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,120
Why do we practice immortality?

532
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,320
To protect the world and the people.

533
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,920
To achieve Taoism.

534
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Now is the time for us to make an effort.

535
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,320
To lure the demon into the demon,

536
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
it should be to open

537
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,320
the ring in the Three Thousand Towers.

538
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,320
It's also an important step.

539
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,920
But only the demon is not enough.

540
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,720
He must have a follow-up action.

541
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,920
So please

542
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
check the information in detail.

543
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Then find the follow-up action

544
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,120
of the Three Thousand Towers.

545
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,720
Is that all?

546
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
But the Demon King...

547
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
I'll go to Wei Jiu

548
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
to ask for the Golden Fire to solve this matter.

549
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
But I have a request.

550
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
After the Demon King is clear,

551
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,520
please allow me to use the Golden Fire.

552
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,920
You want...

553
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
My master is still alive.

554
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
The Golden Fire

555
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,720
can help me to pull him back.

556
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,920
If I want to use him,

557
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,920
I won't let him succeed.

558
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,200
I'll go back to theWelcome

559
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,720
What's wrong with the water lamp?

560
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
libation.

561
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
I was walking on the run.

562
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,560
You won't die as yet,

563
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
I will kill

564
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
you in the end.

565
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Jin Mi and Taoabi

566
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,740
a centipede

567
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,100
is a righteous person

568
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Mother

569
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,560
Mother

570
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,680
Demon King

571
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,560
Father,

572
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,240
do you want to go back to the time when we were on the top?

573
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,840
I would believe you?

574
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,840
You are standing here now

575
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,560
because I made it happen.

576
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,920
There is nothing in this world

577
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,640
that can be done without changing.

578
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,080
We both had our own positions back then.

579
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,480
Who said that now

580
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,400
we wouldn't cooperate

581
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,120
for the sake of the same goal?

582
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,800
Why?

583
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,480
Back then, you wanted to open the Three Thousand-Way Tower

584
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
and leave the Demon Realm

585
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,720
and leave those demons in the mortal world.

586
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,920
And my wish came true.

587
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
I just hope

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
that my wife and I can go back to the time when we first met.

589
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,840
You are going to open the Three Thousand-Way Tower?

590
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,120
Interesting.

591
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,080
It's very interesting.

592
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Don't talk anymore.

593
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,400
Rest.

594
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,640
Clan Leader Wei is good at scheming.

595
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,920
He made others suffer because of the Soul Master.

596
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
But he still held the Golden Fire in his hand.

597
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,480
For the sake of your good use of the Gu Yuan Pellet

598
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,520
for Tu Jiuyuan,

599
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,960
I won't be mad at you.

600
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
Why are you still here?

601
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,120
Aren't you in a rush to find your

602
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,880
good master who has been possessed by the demon?

603
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm going.

604
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,320
Are you really going to find your good master?

605
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,680
You should first settle the score.

606
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,600
If you didn't risk your life to take the Golden Fire,

607
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
how could the following things have happened?

608
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,240
What do you want?

609
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,280
I want to take the Golden Fire.

610
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
I also want you, Xuantian Sect, to cooperate with the Xuan Sect

611
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,080
to destroy the Demon Realm with the power of the Golden Fire

612
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,600
and save the world.

613
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
The Golden Fire was taken by my men

614
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,920
after they put their lives into it.

615
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
Why should I give it to you?

616
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm not discussing it with you.

617
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,760
Don't you think that the world is in chaos

618
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
and you can control the demons with the Golden Fire

619
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,160
and you can be at ease?

620
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,760
This time, Duantian has attracted the Xuan Sect to Chiyan Mountain.

621
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,280
Aren't you also deeply hurt?

622
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
What he wants to destroy

623
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,040
is the heaven and earth where we live.

624
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,520
At this time,

625
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,560
are you still thinking of cleaning yourself up?

626
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,440
You...

627
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,760
Miss Xue is right.

628
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,760
The Golden Fire entered the Amber Pillar

629
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,480
and it did have an external effect.

630
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,680
I'm afraid that it's Duantian who did it.

631
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,600
Honorable Superior should see clearly what's happening.

632
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,840
Are you feeling better?

633
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,280
Then come out and teach me a lesson.

634
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,280
The Golden Fire

635
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,160
was taken by you.

636
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
If you're willing to give it to her,

637
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,080
why should I stop you?

638
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,920
Miss Xue and I have a life-saving ability.

639
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,040
Moreover, what she said is also very reasonable.

640
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,720
Okay, okay.

641
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Miss Xue is suitable.

642
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,520
Miss Xue imitates the way of Orphanage...

643
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Master is also suitable.

644
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,080
From now on,

645
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,560
in front of me,

646
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
I will tell you everything.

647
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
rapidly on time.

648
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,580
XiaoBai

649
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,740
Aren't you going home to rest yet?

650
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,720
It's time for me to go

651
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,940
I

652
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,620
Shopkeeper Xu, hearty representing

653
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,880
To you

654
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,320
Hurry

655
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,440
Hurry

656
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,040
Don't you dare stand there

657
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,960
Thank you

658
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,660
Do you have 소빙frienda?

659
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,320
Come

660
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,020
Come

661
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,280
Hold on

662
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll leave it here if you like it.

663
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
If you don't like it, just throw it away.

664
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,880
I have enough of these.

665
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,480
Leave us.

666
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Yes.

667
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,040
In the past,

668
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
Chi Wen Ling was the head of the old sect.

669
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
He was the leader of the sect.

670
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
He was the leader of the sect.

671
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
He was the leader of the sect.

672
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,520
He was the leader of the sect.

673
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,640
He was the leader of the sect.

674
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,000
The old sect leader gave it to you.

675
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,120
Now,

676
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,480
I'm the one who gave you the sect order.

677
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,800
Do you know what this represents?

678
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
These are useless to me.

679
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,040
Tu Jiu Yuan,

680
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm willing to give you half of the leadership of Xuantian Sect.

681
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,040
You still don't appreciate it?

682
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,640
What else do you want?

683
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,600
I...

684
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
If you insist on making me like you,

685
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,760
then I could...

686
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,480
I've told you I'm leaving it here.

687
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,800
Just do as you wish.

688
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,160
Don't be a child

689
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,600
or fool me any longer.

690
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,240
But...

691
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,440
You were readers of order

692
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,320
but gaveịa person mix me up.

693
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
But you just said you liked me.

694
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,200
I still don't understand.

695
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,240
You turned away

696
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,880
and became merciless.

697
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
You're playing with me

698
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
and playing with me.

699
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,280
Listen,

700
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
I won't do that.

701
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,480
What I said is true.

702
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,000
The young man's feelings are true.

703
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,360
The feelings he kept for decades are true.

704
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
But now,

705
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,600
I have nothing to ask for

706
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,120
or to ask for from you.

707
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,680
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

708
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,200
the pain I've been through for decades

709
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
and let me go.

710
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,560
I just hope

711
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,760
that in the rest of my life,

712
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,440
I can live my own life.

713
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,200
Okay.

714
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,960
I can't keep you.

715
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,800
Why should I ask for it?

716
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,120
Just leave now.

717
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

718
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,760
the pain I've been through for decades.

719
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,160
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

720
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,000
the pain I've been through for decades.

721
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,320
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

722
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,320
the pain I've been through for decades.

723
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,760
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

724
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,600
the pain I've been through for decades.

725
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,400
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

726
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,240
the pain I've been through for decades.

727
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,160
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

728
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,080
the pain I've been through for decades.

729
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,040
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

730
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
the pain I've been through for decades.

731
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,720
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

732
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,040
the pain I've been through for decades.

733
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm afraid that you'll be able to see

734
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,120
the pain I've been through for decades.

735
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,480
Thank you featured to her Hey Yumal

736
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,960
so as to open up her head.

737
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,120
Shisi, no need.

738
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,520
You've grown old.

739
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
You'll be blessed

740
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,200
if you keep praying.

741
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,040
Master, I...

742
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,680
You can call me Ranran.

743
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,080
Ranran, as you wish.

744
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,120
You were drunk at that time, right?

745
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,560
It's been a long time.

746
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,000
It doesn't matter now.

747
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,320
You want to make weapons or weapons?

748
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,520
Just leave it to me.

749
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,920
Thanks to you and Xiaoshui

750
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,920
who took care of Xishan.

751
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,360
Xiaoshui is used to being poisoned.

752
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
But with you,

753
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
he can still talk.

754
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,080
If he didn't save you even if he tried his best,

755
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,080
I wouldn't have talked to him.

756
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,680
He said that

757
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,000
when you recovered your memory,

758
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,560
he would punish you.

759
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,840
But I knew you wouldn't blame him.

760
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,520
Now he...

761
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,200
Before I went back to Xishan,

762
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,360
Yuchun and Yutong sent me a message

763
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,920
that Xiaoshui is totally possessed.

764
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,320
Yuchun and Yutong were also badly injured

765
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
and hurt by the demon aura.

766
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
I brought them back

767
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,600
and told them to close the door and rest.

768
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,720
They need to rest for a few years before they can leave.

769
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,360
Take care of them during this period.

770
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
Duan Tian is really a man of his word.

771
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,280
If Su Yushui is totally possessed,

772
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:48,800
then...

773
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,520
I don't believe it.

774
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
I'll bring him back.

775
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,440
You'll bring him back.

776
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,760
By the way, master,

777
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,200
the whole Xiong Neng knows

778
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,920
about your identity.

779
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,240
They know that they've mistaken you.

780
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,640
Now they're all under Xishan.

781
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
They're so guilty that they dare not come up.

782
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,000
What do you think?

783
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,760
It's not their fault.

784
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,600
But they don't need to come back.

785
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,600
I don't know

786
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,880
what kind of trouble

787
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,400
Xishan will face after this.

788
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,160
Why bother to bring them in?

789
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,720
I'm afraid

790
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,280
there's not much time left.

791
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,920
Master,

792
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,880
the demon Su Yushui

793
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,320
broke into our Jiuhua Mountain.

794
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,000
Where is he now?

795
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,160
He's been bitten by a rock.

796
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,520
You had better tell him.

797
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:55,360
Tell the

798
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,280
guards,

799
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,520
How dare you touch my Nine Glowing container?

800
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:14,200
It turns out that you're trying to

801
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Master!

802
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Master!

803
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Leave the real person to me.

804
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
Su Yi Shui!

805
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,200
Su Yi Shui is no longer here.

806
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
What?

807
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,000
Are you here to hide from me?

808
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Su Yi Shui!

809
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I want to return to you, but my heart is still watered down.

810
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,200
I cry for you, but my heart is still watered down.

811
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,200
The moon is in the sky, while I'm in the snow.

812
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,200
The snow is falling, but I'm still in the wind.

813
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I'm not afraid of losing you, I'm afraid of losing the world.

814
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,200
If I could have a year of my life,

815
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
I would be with you forever.

816
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I could only dream of the day we could meet again.

817
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Why do I have to go through all the hardships alone?

818
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I could only be with you forever.

819
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,200
I could only be with you forever.

820
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
If I could have a year of my life,

821
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,200
I would be with you forever.

822
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,200
I could only be with you forever.

823
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,200
I could only be with you forever.

824
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
I could only be with you forever.

825
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,200
I could only be with you forever.

826
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I could only be with you forever.

827
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,200
I could only be with you forever.
