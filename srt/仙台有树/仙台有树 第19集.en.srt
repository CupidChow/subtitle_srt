[Episode 19]

3
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Mr. Yu?

4
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,150
Mr. Yu?

5
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,710
Mr. Yu?

6
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,590
Ranran.

7
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,440
Luckily, it was severed in time.

8
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
Only half of your soul was taken.

9
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
It will come back.

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,440
Thank you.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,840
Master.

12
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,560
Master!

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
There seems to be an exit over there.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,530
Let's go.

15
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,260
Quickly, let's go.

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,470
Are you hurt?

17
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm fine.

18
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
Xue Ranran.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,190
I was wrong.

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,890
I didn't listen to you.

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,730
But that monstrous head

22
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,750
almost devoured

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,750
Mr. Yu's soul.

24
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,150
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

25
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,210
Master, please punish me if you want.

26
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,470
Ranran fell into danger

27
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,360
for saving me.

28
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,280
However you plan to punish her,

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,740
please punish me instead.

30
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,440
Who do you think you are?

31
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,470
Since when do you have a say

32
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,130
in the Wester Sect's affairs?

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,910
If it weren't for your incompetence,

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,240
how could you have been bewitched by a devil?

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,190
Didn't you

36
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,050
hear her voice?

37
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,150
Shui.

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,079
Didn't we agree to never meet again

39
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,690
in this life and all lives to come?

40
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,310
Why are you

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,040
showing up in front of me again?

42
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,940
You're not her.

43
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,810
You made her suffer so much back then,

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,710
and you feel no guilt at all.

45
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,430
How could you

46
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,030
be so indifferent

47
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,120
when you saw her?

48
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,520
You believe that because you're stupid.

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,920
You...

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,840
We still haven't escaped from this formation?

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,710
The formation

52
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,190
has probably already expanded to the village.

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,829
You three,

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
form the Five Elements Sword Formation with me.

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,070
Yes, Master.

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
What exactly is this monster?

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,920
Why is it so powerful?

58
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,580
This thing

59
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,330
is likely

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,630
Nine-Headed Kui'ao, a vicious beast

61
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,760
that devours souls.

62
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,800
It has nine heads and a turtle's body.

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,070
Not only can it bewitch people,

64
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,480
but it can also create illusions

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,040
and trap people in its formation.

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,170
The shell on its back

67
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,870
is the center of the formation.

68
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,510
So this thing is a giant turtle?

69
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,600
We've been fighting it for so long

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,190
and have only seen

71
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,190
a few of its heads.

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,870
We haven't even seen

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,000
its body or shell.

74
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,630
What should we do?

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,190
For now, we can only use the Five Elements Sword Formation

76
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,390
to suppress its power

77
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,010
and keep it from breaking through the ground.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,600
Xi'er!

79
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,120
Xi'er!

80
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,360
Are you alright?

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
So it's you.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,870
Don't even think about stopping this formation!

83
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,400
Let the Nine-Headed Kui'ao

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,920
devour everything!

85
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,750
Oh no.

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
It won't be long

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,870
before it succeeds!

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,210
The Green Dragon Divine Power?

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,260
We can't keep going like this.

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,180
Hurry up and head east!

91
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,750
Yes!

92
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,070
Why is there a barrier here?

93
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,040
Why can't that thing enter,

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,950
but we can?

95
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,540
-Master!
-Master.

96
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,120
It seems someone

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,950
has set up

98
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,310
a powerful spiritual barrier here,

99
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,630
preventing both mortals and evil beings from entering.

100
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,830
That's why the Nine-Headed Kui'ao's formation

101
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,000
is ineffective here.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,930
I never expected

103
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
that the one controlling all of this

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,830
behind the scenes would be Mr. Liu.

105
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,480
How does he have

106
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,540
such strong power?

107
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,630
I secretly investigated before,

108
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,630
and there was no demonic aura on him.

109
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,030
He must have been bewitched by some evil being

110
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,630
and gained some kind of power.

111
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,600
If he really was bewitched by an evil being,

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,860
then everything he did

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
was to create malicious energy

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,160
and nourish that evil being.

115
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,520
This formation is expanding.

116
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
I don't know how long

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,940
this barrier can hold.

118
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,430
I wonder

119
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,190
if there's some hidden secret here.

120
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's split up

121
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,690
and look for a way to escape.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,059
Heaven is truly on my side!

123
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
I never expected

124
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,750
such a powerful evil being to be here now.

125
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,549
This is the perfect opportunity

126
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,409
to get rid of these nuisances.

127
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,750
This spell is...

128
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,960
Back then, they used this formation

129
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,670
against me.

130
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,670
Now, I'll return the favor

131
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,550
in kind.

132
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,160
Won't that be interesting?

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,910
It looks like

134
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,910
no one has lived here for a long time.

135
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,000
Being able to set up such a powerful barrier,

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,720
the owner

137
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,450
must not be an ordinary person.

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,410
But we can't

139
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,960
just keep hiding here forever.

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,470
Otherwise, we'll be trapped to death sooner or later.

141
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,070
Oh, right.

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
That Nine-Headed Kui'ao can call people's names,

143
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
and only when you respond does it bewitch you.

144
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,930
So let's each choose a codename

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
and only call each other by that.

146
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,750
If you hear someone calling your real name,

147
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,520
don't answer

148
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,360
and don't look.

149
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,270
That way, we won't fall into its trap.

150
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,030
Mr. Yu,

151
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,030
how about calling you "Taro?"

152
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,510
Master,

153
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
you'll be "Pumpkin."

154
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,250
What a coincidence.

155
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,120
Qingge's

156
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,200
favorite dish

157
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,120
used to be taro,

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,080
and the one she liked the least

159
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,910
was pumpkin.

160
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Change it.

161
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,000
Also,

162
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,900
he's not allowed to be called "Taro."

163
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,710
It's just a temporary codename.

164
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,240
Alright.

165
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,150
Well, Master, you can be...

166
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,880
"Ice Lotus."

167
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Mr. Yu,

168
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,760
you can be "Lingxi."

169
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,720
Change it again.

170
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,080
Then you can be Su the First,

171
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,290
and you can be Su the Second.

172
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,290
Why is he the first

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,370
and I the second?

174
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,870
No.

175
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
A Crown Prince

176
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,670
and an immortal master.

177
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,910
Two prominent figures

178
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,750
are arguing over something so trivial.

179
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,440
Mr. Yu,

180
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,600
let me help you with your wound.

181
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,960
Yu,

182
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,510
bear the pain.

183
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,240
Ranran,

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,930
you resemble an old friend of mine.

185
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,310
Crown Prince,

186
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,730
the Crown Princess is waiting for you in the palace.

187
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,910
Why don't you check on Xi'er and the others?

188
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,720
The matter between Master Mu and Mr. Yu

189
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,180
has already been settled.

190
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,270
Master still can't

191
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,790
let go of Master Mu

192
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
and keeps clashing with Mr. Yu.

193
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,910
Do your job as the Crown Prince well

194
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,480
and stay away from my disciples.

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,610
Is it staying away from your disciples

196
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,390
or just from Ranran?

197
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,870
You clearly

198
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,360
don't care about anything,

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,490
but you're so concerned about Ranran.

200
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,840
Could it be that Ranran's identity

201
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,130
is very special?

202
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,330
Why should I explain to you

203
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,120
how I treat the people

204
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,240
around me?

205
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,480
You,

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,760
a treacherous person,

207
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,080
only hurt those who treat you well.

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,460
How could Ranran,

209
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,650
such a pure and kind girl,

210
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,220
stay by your side?

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,010
She can only have

212
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,080
the life she wants

213
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,360
if she comes with me.

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,650
Don't you dare come near her again.

215
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,840
Could it really be that

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,270
the drop of Spirit Spring in my heart hasn't been fully removed,

217
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,080
so now, the closer I get to the Spirit Spring,

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,610
the stronger the reaction?

219
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,510
Master,

220
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,510
Ranran found a hidden compartment.

221
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,070
There's a hidden compartment?

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,550
Ranran, how did you know about it?

223
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,910
I don't know why,

224
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,070
but I just couldn't resist tapping it.

225
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,550
Immortal, please forgive us.

226
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,150
This is...

227
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,000
It's her.

228
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,090
Qingge doesn't like using sound transmission talismans,

229
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,360
so she made wooden figurines specifically

230
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,760
to send messages for her.

231
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
This wooden figurine looks

232
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,970
almost identical to the ones she made.

233
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,470
Could it be...

234
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
that this is really the place

235
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,890
where Qingge once lived?

236
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,970
There's a booklet here.

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,240
It does look like

238
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,700
Master Mu's handwriting.

239
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,750
Sister Wu?

240
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,670
It really is hers.

241
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,940
[Tranquility Pavilion]

242
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,690
This seems to be

243
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,180
some of Master Mu's notes.

244
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,030
Could there be

245
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,490
information about the Nine-Headed Kui'ao?

246
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
In March of the Year of Yuangui,

247
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
I received help from Uncle Ye Xin.

248
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,510
So it seems that Master Mu learned

249
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,080
all of her abilities

250
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,740
from this person named Ye Xin.

251
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,240
He must be someone

252
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,770
who's incredibly capable.

253
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,730
This must be Uncle Ye Xin's portrait.

254
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Master.

255
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,110
It's strange though—

256
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,170
where...

257
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,840
did Uncle Ye Xin go later?

258
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
How come he never appeared

259
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,750
during major events

260
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,010
like Master Mu's death

261
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,630
and resurrection?

262
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,910
Since he's a master,

263
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,750
could it be that he completed his cultivation and ascended

264
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,550
when he was traveling the world?

265
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,410
This person...

266
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,130
looks familiar.

267
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,030
Portraits

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,700
always make everyone look the same, I guess.

269
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,250
In May of the Year of Tianyi,

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,460
unexpectedly,

271
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,120
I met the young master from years ago

272
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
who once gave me a meal.

273
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,250
He was suppressing bandits with the army.

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,750
Days ago, you and I worked together to eliminate the bandits.

275
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,600
We can be considered friends

276
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,080
who have faced hardships together.

277
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,010
From now on, just call me by my name.

278
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,750
Alright.

279
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm a few years older than you.

280
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,960
From now on, I'll call you Yu.

281
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,840
Turns out, Master Mu

282
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,220
and the Crown Prince had known each other

283
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,820
even before meeting Master.

284
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,630
Back then, I just

285
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,030
gave Qingge some pastry.

286
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,310
Qingge said she would repay this kindness,

287
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,550
but I thought she was only saying it casually.

288
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,680
I never expected her

289
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,140
to work so hard in cultivation

290
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
just to fulfill her promise.

291
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
Back then, Qingge obviously came to me

292
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
out of gratitude,

293
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,210
but I pushed her away with my own hands.

294
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,090
Perhaps this time,

295
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,520
I'll still have a chance.

296
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,370
She cultivated because it was her ambition.

297
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,400
Repaying your kindness was just something she did along the way.

298
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
You don't have to

299
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
relate everything to yourself.

300
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,560
There are a few letters here.

301
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,990
This one seems to be

302
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,440
from the Crown Prince to Master Mu.

303
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
When I was reunited with Qingge,

304
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,369
I found we got along like old friends.

305
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
We often exchanged letters.

306
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,079
Affairs in the imperial family

307
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,109
rarely make one happy,

308
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,440
so I unconsciously wrote to her

309
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
to confide in her.

310
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,609
And every time Qingge replied,

311
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,310
she cheered me up.

312
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,000
At that time,

313
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,310
Qingge was like

314
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,440
a light in my heart.

315
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,680
Sounds like

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,060
the past Master Mu was quite nice.

317
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,750
But why does she

318
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,880
seem different now?

319
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,960
Looks like the Grandmaster was truly devoted

320
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,440
to the Crown Prince.

321
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,260
She even carefully treasured

322
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,060
the letter he had written to her.

323
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,010
I sense a hint of jealousy.

324
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,440
It must be Master being jealous

325
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,040
of the Grandmaster and the Crown Prince again.

326
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,680
Wait a minute.

327
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,850
There's also the damp,

328
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,810
rainy scent of the monsoon season,

329
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,950
and the sharp,

330
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,480
spicy smell of hot peppers.

331
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Wait.

332
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,640
Are you...

333
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,630
eating...

334
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,380
No, I'm not.

335
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,160
Don't talk nonsense.

336
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Put the letters back.

337
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,260
It's just some casual pleasantries

338
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,610
with an acquaintance

339
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,900
she doesn't often see,

340
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
nothing to make a fuss about.

341
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,780
Pleasantries?

342
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,110
No matter where she was,

343
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,200
Qingge always shared the interesting things she came across with me

344
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,930
and cared about whether I was facing any trouble.

345
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,440
She even sent me her favorite waxberries.

346
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,480
Master Mu likes waxberries?

347
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,030
But why did she tell me that she never eats

348
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,030
sour things the last time she saw me?

349
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,510
Of course she doesn't like sour things.

350
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,640
After being Qingge's disciple for so long,

351
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,720
you don't even know

352
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,940
what she likes to eat.

353
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,510
Strange.

354
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,840
One said she likes sour things,

355
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,970
and the other said she doesn't.

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,750
Why is that?

357
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,000
She wrote Collection of Entertainment,

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,920
but now she doesn't seem like

359
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,580
an interesting person at all.

360
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,030
Why do I always feel that

361
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,160
something's off

362
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,530
with this Mu Qingge?

363
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,260
Xue Ranran, what are you thinking about?

364
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,110
Anyway, no matter

365
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,130
what Mu Qingge is like,

366
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,160
the person Master cares about

367
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,890
is still her.

368
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,790
You shouldn't have

369
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,120
any more expectations.

370
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,200
Why are you spacing out here alone?

371
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,240
It's nothing.

372
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,550
I'm just thinking about

373
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,210
what to do after leaving here.

374
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,180
Oh, Mr. Yu,

375
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,960
what's the capital like?

376
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,890
I heard it's very big and bustling.

377
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,270
Do you think it would be a good idea

378
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,070
for me to open a restaurant there?

379
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,670
You want to go to the capital?

380
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,440
As long as you want to go there,

381
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,300
I can arrange everything for you.

382
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,110
I'll take you to explore the entire capital,

383
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,920
see plays,

384
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,070
watch the mountains covered in maple leaves,

385
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,750
and eat the best Eight-Treasure Duck.

386
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,270
Mr. Yu, I...

387
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,750
When did you get the idea to go to the capital?

388
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,280
Master, have you forgotten?

389
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,240
Haven't I always wanted to go to the capital?

390
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,720
You said it yourself, Master,

391
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,960
that once I settle down

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,020
and find a husband,

393
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,830
you would prepare a dowry for me.

394
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,550
I think

395
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,470
the capital is a great place to settle down.

396
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,440
Alright.

397
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,440
Ranran,

398
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll wait for you in the capital then.

399
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,790
That's the person who drove us away earlier.

400
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,450
Be careful.

401
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,880
She has

402
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,550
the same energy as that old man.

403
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,550
I mean no harm.

404
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,920
I am him,

405
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,320
yet I am not him.

406
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,920
What do you mean by that?

407
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,300
Don't play tricks.

408
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,710
Two souls in one body?

409
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,850
You share the same body

410
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
with that Mr. Liu?

411
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,270
Actually,

412
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,170
it's more like my soul

413
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,660
resides in Mr. Liu's body.

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,720
However,

415
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,770
I can only appear at dusk and dawn,

416
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,890
when day and night

417
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,720
change.

418
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,960
Earlier, I didn't have much time.

419
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,560
Don't come in! Don't come in!

420
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,300
Be careful!

421
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,480
I couldn't explain it to you.

422
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,550
So

423
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,270
I thought it best to drive you away first.

424
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,310
Who are you?

425
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,210
[Meng Zhang, Green Dragon]

426
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
My name is Meng Zhang.

427
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,370
I was originally

428
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,570
a Green Dragon on Divine Dragon Island.

429
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,130
You're a dragon?

430
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,610
Many years ago,

431
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
I left the island on an errand.

432
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,860
Unexpectedly,

433
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,830
I met

434
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,640
the love of my life,

435
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,790
Liu.

436
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,400
Are you talking about

437
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
that Mr. Liu?

438
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,880
I secretly stayed in the mortal world

439
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,720
and spent many happy years with him.

440
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,590
However,

441
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,280
19 years ago, during the Battle of Fanyao,

442
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,240
I lost a dragon egg

443
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,170
that I had been guarding for years.

444
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,910
While searching for the egg,

445
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,350
I was mortally wounded by a beast that escaped

446
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,080
from the netherworld and died.

447
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,750
Liu was devastated

448
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,880
and unwilling to let me go.

449
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,720
Unexpectedly, he was deceived by the Spirit Spring.

450
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,780
The Spirit Spring?

451
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,550
It's just to make him lose consciousness for a moment.

452
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,310
The Spirit Spring

453
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,920
must not be known to more people.

454
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
The situation here

455
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,120
is indeed related to the Spirit Spring.

456
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,650
What did you mean

457
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
when you said that Mr. Liu was deceived

458
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,950
by the Spirit Spring?

459
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,610
The Seven Evil Transformation Spell?

460
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,190
The Spirit Spring entered Liu's dreams and bewitched him,

461
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,680
causing him to practice this spell,

462
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,110
merging my dragon soul

463
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,000
with his body.

464
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,830
Because the Spirit Spring told him

465
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,790
that if he followed its instructions,

466
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,450
it could bring me back to life.

467
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,630
My lingering soul remained.

468
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,880
But from then,

469
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,410
Liu and I

470
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,970
have been sharing one body.

471
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,140
Although we are together,

472
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,350
we can never truly meet.

473
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,120
However, Liu became increasingly obsessed after that.

474
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,590
He obtained the Green Dragon Divine Power

475
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,550
from my body

476
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,240
and used it to subdue a Nine-Headed Kui'ao.

477
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Was it your Liu

478
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,550
who controlled the Nine-Headed Kui'ao

479
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,310
and stole the Spirit Spring from Wangxiang Pass?

480
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,720
Yes,

481
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,400
it was he

482
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,830
who stole the soul-sealing stele that was sealing

483
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,890
the Spirit Spring,

484
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,350
found nine evil swords,

485
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,480
and created the Soul Devouring Formation.

486
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,550
For over a decade,

487
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,370
Liu has been constantly luring

488
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,500
living people here,

489
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,590
allowing the Nine-Headed Kui'ao

490
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,240
to devour souls and accumulate malicious energy.

491
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,030
Therefore, the power of the Nine-Headed Kui'ao

492
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,790
has grown stronger and stronger,

493
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,720
and it has gradually merged with the mountain.

494
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,750
The Spirit Spring is truly despicable.

495
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,720
It actually took advantage

496
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
of Mr. Liu's love

497
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,330
and lured him into doing evil things.

498
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,000
I never expected

499
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,750
that the Seven Evil Transformation Spell

500
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,480
could not only fuse a person

501
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
with a beast's body

502
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,010
but also integrate a dragon's soul into one's body.

503
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,680
It seems that the reason

504
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,320
that the Spirit Spring chose your Liu from the very beginning

505
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,930
was to

506
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,670
use your Green Dragon Divine Power.

507
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,340
So,

508
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,750
the Nine-Headed Kui'ao devouring souls

509
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,110
and accumulating malicious energy

510
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,160
is actually to

511
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,160
nourish the Spirit Spring inside it,

512
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,650
allowing it to break through the seal.

513
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,510
Now, whether it's to break the formation to escape

514
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,740
or to find the Spirit Spring,

515
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,460
we must locate

516
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,110
the body of the Nine-Headed Kui'ao.

517
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,110
I know where it is.

518
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,000
I can tell you

519
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,550
where the body of the Kui'ao is.

520
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,550
If the formation is broken,

521
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,810
Liu will no longer be able to harm anyone.

522
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,720
However,

523
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,880
I want to ask you

524
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,410
to agree to two conditions.

525
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,270
First,

526
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,240
don't harm Liu.

527
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,050
All his crimes and heavenly punishments

528
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,840
will be shouldered by me alone.

529
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,790
Second,

530
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,550
I want to ask you

531
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,750
to help me retrieve

532
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,950
the dragon egg I lost.

533
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,550
Would you...

534
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,310
agree?

535
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,210
Alright.

536
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,280
I promise you.

537
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,620
Xue Ranran.

538
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,440
Master,

539
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,380
I trust her.

540
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,750
Besides,

541
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,920
if we find the formation's core ourselves,

542
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,320
it will take a lot of time.

543
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,230
Since you've agreed,

544
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,350
please swear a soul oath

545
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
that you will help me find the dragon egg

546
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,350
and safely send it to the Dragon Island.

547
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,030
Otherwise,

548
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,480
you will suffer the punishment

549
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,280
of your spiritual power dissipating completely.

550
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,040
Master...

551
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,930
The soul oath has been made.

552
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,530
Speak now.

553
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,590
Oh no.

554
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
Dawn is approaching.

555
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,480
Zhang,

556
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,720
go back.

557
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,880
Go back!

558
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,400
According to the map,

559
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,550
you can avoid the formation

560
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,010
and find the body of the Nine-Headed Kui'ao.

561
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,150
Destroy the nine evil swords,

562
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,010
and the formation will be broken.

563
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,210
Let's go.

564
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,440
Where are we?

565
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,290
There's a sword light.

566
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,540
The formation's core is indeed here.

567
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,080
It seems

568
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,910
the Kui'ao's shell is down here.

569
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,000
It's so large.

570
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,030
This formation

571
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,070
has allowed it to absorb a lot of malicious energy,

572
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,470
so it has grown enormous.

573
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,400
We must go down there

574
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,550
and destroy this formation

575
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,160
to restore everything to normal.

576
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,090
You all stay up here and wait for me.

577
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,990
You're asking for death!

578
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,640
Master, be careful!

579
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I'll hold him off.

580
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,640
You go down and destroy the swords to break the formation.

581
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,310
Master!

582
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,200
Go!

583
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,400
We are...

584
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,810
on the back of the Nine-Headed Kui'ao?

585
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,110
Everyone, help me block these malicious energy

586
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,030
and break a path open.

587
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,890
I'll charge in!

588
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,430
Don't waste your energy.

589
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,510
Those nine swords are exceptionally fierce.

590
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,960
How could your little disciples

591
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,820
deal with them?

592
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,680
Go to hell!

593
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,720
He has the Green Dragon Divine Power within him,

594
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,450
making him no ordinary person.

595
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,020
He's not easy to deal with.

596
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,310
Soul-hosting Stone?

597
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,070
Ranran!

598
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,420
Master!

599
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,380
Qingge's Qingming Sword?

600
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,930
Qingming Sword can only be used by its master.

601
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,240
Only Qingge can resonate with the spiritual power

602
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,300
of Qingming Sword.

603
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,570
It's really you,

604
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,970
Qingge.

605
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,030
One Qi!

606
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Break the galaxy!

607
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,970
Master.

608
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,070
I'm fine.

609
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,680
So, Qingming Sword

610
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,640
was sealed here by you

611
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,370
to suppress the Spirit Spring.

612
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,680
Ranran.

613
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,210
Ranran.

614
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,680
Without the nourishment of malicious energy,

615
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,480
the spiritual power of the Nine-Headed Kui'ao will dissipate,

616
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,510
and it will no longer be able to imprison

617
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,880
those souls it devoured.

618
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,810
They will return to their bodies on their own.

619
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,880
The bodies of those who were devoured

620
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
by the Nine-Headed Kui'ao not long ago are still intact

621
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
and will soon awaken.

622
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,250
This formation has been destroyed.

623
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,800
The Nine-Headed Kui'ao will turn to stone

624
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,230
and merge with the earth.

625
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,450
Sure enough,

626
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
it's that drop of the Spirit Spring.

627
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,550
Su Yishui!

628
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,270
As long as you're alive,

629
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,960
you'll never escape the fate

630
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,490
of being the Demon's child!

631
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,720
Constantly refined

632
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,850
until it turns into bone and blood.

633
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,200
So, this drop of the Spirit Spring

634
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,060
can never be completely removed.

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,030
Master,

636
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,280
are you alright?

637
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,890
No matter what,

638
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,720
I should seal the Spirit Spring first.

639
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,650
Xi'er, Gao Cang,

640
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,350
go and keep an eye on that Mr. Liu

641
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,440
and take the villagers who've awakened

642
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,100
out of here.

643
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,430
-Yes, Master.
-Yes, Master.

644
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,270
Your soldiers

645
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,950
should be waking up soon.

646
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,200
Ranran,

647
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,660
I'll wait for you outside.

648
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,680
Master.

649
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,000
Is this the spell seal?

650
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,450
This is indeed her spell seal,

651
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,240
the one she set up using her Golden Core

652
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,370
as the key back then.

653
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,940
You're overdrawing your spiritual power with your lifespan?

654
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,080
Why...

655
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,910
is your Golden Core gone too?

656
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,680
The only one who would empty their own Golden Core

657
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,030
regardless of the consequences

658
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,030
is Mu Qingge.

659
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,160
Master,

660
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,190
let's get to the task at hand.

661
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,450
The seal has indeed loosened.

662
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,350
That's why the demonic nature of the Spirit Spring

663
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,790
has spread further and further

664
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,450
and affected Wangxiang Pass.

665
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,840
If we had come any later,

666
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,500
the malicious energy accumulated by the Nine-Headed Kui'ao

667
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,390
might have helped the Spirit Spring

668
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,070
break through the seal

669
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,730
and escape.

670
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,780
There seem to be

671
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,250
some words carved here.

672
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,550
Shui,

673
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,640
it must be you.

674
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,480
Remember what you promised me.

675
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,240
You must return the Spirit Spring to the netherworld.

676
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,970
Don't have any other thoughts.

677
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,260
Remember that.

678
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,910
Oh, right.

679
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
I've also hidden

680
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,320
a jar of freshly brewed Mistaken Divine

681
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,639
behind the waterfall in Mount Wester.

682
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,139
♫I've shed thousands of tears, but my feelings haven't run dry♫

683
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,000
I think

684
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,020
I may no longer be able to drink it myself.

685
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,670
Please enjoy it on my behalf.

686
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:20,030
♫Hatred adds grayness to my hair♫

687
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,080
Don't let the years of aging

688
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,400
go to waste.

689
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
July of the Year of Jiashen.

690
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,370
♫Which side does destiny choose?♫

691
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,230
Mu Qingge.

692
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,760
♫Demon or immortal?♫

693
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,820
♫With you by my side, I'm fearless in the face of life's hardships♫

694
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,290
♫If love wants me to die♫

695
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,900
♫I won't give up because of you♫

696
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,830
♫Thousands of steps to cross the sky-high chasm♫

697
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,880
♫Reincarnation and fate can't be denied♫

698
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,980
♫Why does the world have everything but love?♫

699
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,210
♫Falling forever is like becoming immortal♫

700
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,780
♫I insist to be with you day after day♫

701
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,820
July of the Year of Jiashen?

702
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,030
That was just before Master Mu was besieged

703
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,560
by the four Heavenly Sects.

704
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
In that case,

705
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,590
these words

706
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:25,770
♫The moment between us is worth 10,000 years♫

707
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,230
must be Master Mu's

708
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,140
last wish from her previous life.

709
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,130
This is what Mu Qingge left for Master.

710
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,230
Master must not

711
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,360
have wanted anyone else to pry into it.

712
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,820
Why did I look at it?

713
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,180
And I've said too much.

714
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,000
Forget it.

715
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,280
Anyway, I don't really want

716
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,610
to know more about them.

717
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,550
How carefree

718
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,480
must a person be,

719
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,670
knowing they're going to die,

720
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,920
yet the only thing they worry about

721
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,050
is just a jar of wine?

722
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,840
Master, do you think

723
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,400
Grandmaster's final words

724
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,480
were too casual?

725
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,800
Worried about a jar of wine,

726
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
but not about you?

727
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,230
So you're upset?

728
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,440
You truly don't care

729
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,790
about your life at all.

730
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,230
Master, if you have any malicious energy,

731
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,000
tell Master Mu about it

732
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
in the future.

733
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,790
The matter of the Spirit Spring hasn't been resolved yet.

734
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,540
The Spirit Spring?

735
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,510
What's on this

736
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,860
is Grandmaster's Golden Core?

737
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,220
Demon's child.

738
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,730
It's the Demon's child.

739
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,070
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

740
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,620
Master, are you alright?

741
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,590
Demon's child,

742
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,280
are you really willing to seal me?

743
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,410
The drop of the Spirit Spring in your heart is still there.

744
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,710
If you give me your body,

745
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,920
we can merge.

746
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,070
I possess supreme magical power

747
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,670
and can give you everything you desire,

748
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,510
including

749
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,160
that little disciple of yours outside.

750
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,480
Yes,

751
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,150
that's right.

752
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,030
Give me your body.

753
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Master!

754
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,920
The Spirit Spring has been successfully sealed.

755
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,110
Master, what's wrong with you?

756
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,440
Why do you look so pale?

757
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,190
I'm fine.

758
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,630
This Heavenly Bottle

759
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,600
sealed the Spirit Spring very quickly.

760
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,360
It shouldn't have triggered the reaction

761
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,960
of the Yin Eye Stone from the Heavenly Sect.

762
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,690
Otherwise, we'd be in trouble.

763
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,440
However,

764
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,970
it can only temporarily seal the Spirit Spring.

765
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,070
We must send the Spirit Spring

766
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,530
back to the netherworld as soon as possible.

767
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,360
The Spirit Spring is of utmost importance.

768
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,110
Do not let anyone else know about the Heavenly Bottle.

769
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,230
Yes, Master.

770
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,320
But Master,

771
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,600
the Spirit Spring is so dangerous,

772
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,000
and the Heavenly Bottle is so chillingly cold.

773
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
You're carrying it with you.

774
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,440
What if...

775
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,760
Using this bottle to seal the Spirit Spring

776
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,220
is not a perfect solution.

777
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,550
I can only carry it with me

778
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,000
and constantly suppress it with my spiritual power

779
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,190
to avoid any issues.

780
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,760
As long as we send the Spirit Spring

781
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,220
back to the netherworld as soon as possible,

782
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,730
I won't be in any danger.

783
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,960
Let's go out first.

784
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,900
Master.

785
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,400
Master.

786
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
The villagers and soldiers

787
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,460
who were rescued

788
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
have been settled

789
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,010
and are slowly recovering.

790
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,360
Ranran,

791
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,560
it's all thanks to you this time.

792
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,470
I owe you another favor for this.

793
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,950
Mr. Yu,

794
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,530
please don't be so formal.

795
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,800
I once saw

796
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,810
this sword in a painting

797
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,640
at the Consonance Palace.

798
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,550
It should be Mu Qingge's

799
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,880
Qingming Sword, right?

800
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
It's indeed Qingge's sword.

801
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,360
The situation was critical earlier.

802
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,890
Perhaps Master Mu's sword

803
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,660
sensed the techniques of the Wester Sect

804
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,950
and flew out to help us.

805
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,320
Now that the crisis is over,

806
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
Mr. Yu,

807
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,860
please return this sword

808
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,630
to Master Mu on my behalf.

809
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,110
Since it was you

810
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,770
who summoned Qingming Sword,

811
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,920
it means that you have a connection with it.

812
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,150
How about you

813
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,130
keep the sword with you?

814
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,840
Keep it.

815
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,230
It originally belonged to the Wester Sect anyway.

816
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,080
In that case,

817
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,190
I will keep it.

818
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,190
Master,

819
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,550
what about Mr. Liu?

820
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,320
No!

821
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,280
No!

822
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,240
Don't!

823
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,550
No, no! Don't!

824
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,490
My spiritual power!

825
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,960
Where's my spiritual power?

826
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,880
My... my...

827
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,820
It was close.

828
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,740
It was so close!

829
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,450
My spiritual power...

830
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,590
It was so close.

831
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,400
-The Seven Evil Transformation Spell has been broken.
-It was so close.

832
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,900
Zhang!

833
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,000
Zhang!

834
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,000
I still can't save you,

835
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,550
Zhang.

836
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,070
Zhang,

837
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,360
you can't come out!

838
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,420
You can't leave me!

839
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,550
You can't leave me, Zhang!

840
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,130
You can't leave me!

841
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,190
You can't leave me!

842
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,230
You can't leave me...

843
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,800
Liu.

844
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,710
Zhang?

845
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,670
Zhang!

846
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,960
Zhang!

847
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,250
I...

848
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,230
I can finally see you again.

849
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,850
You're still so beautiful.

850
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,880
Zhang,

851
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,590
why are you so foolish?

852
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,460
I could have saved you.

853
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,520
I could have.

854
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,190
I could have saved you.

855
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,710
I could have saved you.

856
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,070
Our sins are too grave.

857
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,630
Liu,

858
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,880
let it go.

859
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,320
Don't harm any more

860
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,770
innocent people for me.

861
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Thank you all

862
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,410
for helping me put an end to all of this.

863
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,030
Zhang!

864
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,470
Farewell,

865
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,590
Liu.

866
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,400
No!

867
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,430
Zhang!

868
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,550
Zhang.

869
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,280
Zhang!

870
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,360
Zhang!

871
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,360
Zhang!

872
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,190
Zhang!

873
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,830
Zhang!

874
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,710
Zhang!

875
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Zhang!

876
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,230
Zhang!

877
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,470
Don't leave me!

878
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,070
Don't leave me alone!

879
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,510
I'd rather die!

880
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,190
It was all my fault.

881
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,350
Let the Heavenly Way punish me!

882
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,640
Zhang!
