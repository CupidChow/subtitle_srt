1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
The Untamed

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel a few times

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel between the north and the west.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I will give you a thousand times of my life.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am destined to be with you.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
But I still have no fear or regret.

9
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
We will never be separated.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,800
I will endure it.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,800
I will slowly get used to you.

12
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Episode 15

13
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
When you know the truth,

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
will you still be like what you said?

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
You will never see me again.

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
I have another good dish.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Wait for me.

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Enough. Enough.

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Master looks so lonely.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
What are you doing?

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
I want to ask if you want to come with me.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
It's good to have a party.

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
You are injured so badly.

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,400
You can't even heal yourself.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
How can you have the mood to make money?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Master, are you seriously injured?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's all because of you.

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
Every time I take you to the mountain,

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,200
you have to put on a lot of pain.

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
You should be more careful.

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Master, are you okay?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
I am sorry, master.

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,400
I caused you a lot of trouble before.

34
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
I even caused you to be injured.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
I am really unfilial.

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
I am sorry.

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
I am sorry.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
I am sorry.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
I am sorry.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
I am sorry.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am sorry.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
I am sorry.

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Master.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
This is the most effective medicine.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
It will heal your wounds.

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I have been hardworking since I was young.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Even if someone gives me a bowl of porridge,

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
I will just follow their instructions.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,600
No one has ever treated me as well as you.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
You are the first person in the world

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
who is not hesitant and just protects me.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I was not willing to lose to you before.

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,600
But I will definitely follow your instructions in the future.

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I will never let you get hurt again.

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Actually,

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
I wanted to use this bowl of martial arts blood

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
to propose a toast to you on behalf of the Golden Lion Tea.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Since you don't like it,

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
then I...

60
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
Master, how do you feel?

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Do you feel better?

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
That's great.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
I will leave first.

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Master has taken the tonic.

65
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
He should be fine now.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Go back to your room and rest.

67
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Why is my heart so heavy?

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
The red eyes are not effective.

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
The blood removal is very effective.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
At the same time, it can also help to raise the vitality and purify the water.

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,800
Chang Yong Yu, Wu Yang Qi?

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
Where is he?

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Master has saved me many times.

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
How can I repay him?

75
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,200
It's not easy to be a master.

76
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
If I knew it, I shouldn't have been soft-hearted

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
and drink that martial arts blood.

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Yu Chen!

79
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Master!

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
How does it happen?

81
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:07,100
A

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,440
You were thrown out certainly,

83
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
but you never get up.

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
I want to go home.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
You're here to make a mess for others?

86
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,960
I just want to repay you.

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I embroidered these flowers

88
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,360
one by one.

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Where's my book?

90
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
I saw the ancient books were all in a mess.

91
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
I helped you get the Sun of Wuwan.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Sun?

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's going on?

94
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,920
Why are all these words gone?

95
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,800
The ancient books were all written with the ink of the Jade.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,280
When you see the sun, it will float like a red feather.

97
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
No one has ever taken it out to dry.

98
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
You're the first one.

99
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,200
What should I do then?

100
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
What else can you do?

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,520
Put all these words back together.

102
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,840
Or you won't get to eat.

103
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,520
What?

104
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm not going to eat.

105
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm going to eat.

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm going to eat.

107
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm going to eat.

108
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm going to eat.

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm going to eat.

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm going to eat.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,680
Ridiculous.

112
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,880
But there are so many words that I don't even recognize.

113
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,160
Where should I put this talisman?

114
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
Ä dramatically.

115
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,520
Why are you putting everything in wrong?

116
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,600
Could it be that you made a total mess

117
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
through other sources?

118
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Thank you for your guidance.

119
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Master only asked me to do my best.

120
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
But he didn't say anything else.

121
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Master, I'm done.

123
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Master, I'm sorry.

126
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
It's a broken face.

127
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Thank you, Master.

128
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
This monster is really powerful.

129
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Are you okay?

130
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
It's so scary.

131
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
I almost got a bone in my face.

132
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Where's Ran Ran?

133
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
She hasn't come out yet.

134
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm coming.

135
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Did I pass?

136
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Great.

137
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I made it.

138
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
You've improved.

139
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Ran Ran, you broke it.

140
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Master Wen's bag is broken.

142
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Your bag is so delicate.

143
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
A good friend of mine gave it to me.

144
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
His name is Mr. Yu.

145
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
He's a good man.

146
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
If I have a chance to go down the mountain,

147
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I'll introduce him to everyone.

148
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
You look so happy.

149
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Is he your lover?

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Master.

151
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
This elixir

152
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
not only controls the blood and fire of the medicine,

153
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,360
but also the heart.

154
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
The effect of the same elixir

155
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
is very different.

156
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Your master was a talent in elixir making.

157
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
His elixir

158
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
not only can make the effect

159
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
the greatest,

160
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
but also has some unexpected new effects.

161
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Ran Ran,

162
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
your spirit energy is finally stable.

163
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Not bad.

164
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Continue.

165
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
The End

166
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
The book says

167
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
the star is a golden flower.

168
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
How did you make a red one?

169
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
What's wrong?

170
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
It smells so good.

171
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
It smells so fresh.

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
It tastes like steamed meat buns.

173
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Ran Ran, it's your first time.

174
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm sure you'll like it.

175
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
It's delicious.

176
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
You can eat it.

177
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I won't eat it.

178
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Master.

179
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Master, bad news.

180
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Something happened.

181
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Blood.

182
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Don't eat it.

183
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
It will turn into a flower.

184
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Stop eating, you two.

185
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Master.

186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Are you okay?

187
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm fine.

188
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Go and call the second brother to fix the blood.

189
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Don't eat it.

190
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
It's so delicious.

191
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm fine.

192
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Don't eat it.

193
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
It's steamed meat.

194
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
It will make you have a stomach ache.

195
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Blood.

196
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Don't eat it.

197
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Don't eat it.

198
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
What's going on?

199
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
I don't know.

200
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,360
They ate the green star balls I made.

201
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
And it turned into this.

202
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
What were you thinking when you were practicing the elixir?

203
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,360
You thought of poison to influence the effect of the green star balls.

204
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Although you can't control yourself,

205
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
you're a cultivator.

206
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,360
You're always thinking about the rules.

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
How are you?

208
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Are you feeling better?

209
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
It's okay, Ran Ran.

210
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Master said we were fighting fire with fire.

211
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
We'll be fine after taking the medicine.

212
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Ran Ran.

213
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
You're practicing the green star balls.

214
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
You're really strong.

215
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
It seems you have a talent for cultivation.

216
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
But the effect...

217
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I didn't expect it.

218
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
You're still practicing the green star balls.

219
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
It's clearly a talent for breaking into the goods.

220
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm sorry to have scared you.

221
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I made a pot of wine to help digest the wine.

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I apologize to you.

223
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
It smells so good, Ran Ran.

224
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
You're so lucky.

225
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
You really followed the instructions of our master.

226
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
You must drink it.

227
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Is that a good thing?

228
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
You've been talking for a long time.

229
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Don't talk.

230
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Green star balls

231
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Come on.

232
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Come.

233
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,120
Cheers.

234
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,480
Okay.

235
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
I worked so hard to cook this.

236
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
But you didn't eat any.

237
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
There's so much wine left.

238
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
You...

239
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,360
I'll go and give some to Uncle Zeng.

240
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,120
Okay.

241
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Practice alone?

242
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,560
Then don't you boys

243
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
have snacks and drinks?

244
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,640
Shifu.

245
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,040
Really?

246
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
My elixir

247
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
has been ruined by my master?

248
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
I didn't expect my elixir

249
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
to be like that.

250
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,880
Enough.

252
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,760
It's not a big deal

253
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,520
to break the elixir.

254
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
What kind of person

255
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,720
will make such a big elixir?

256
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,000
You are not

257
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,280
a person who is pure and pure.

258
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,600
You have always been

259
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,800
the one you love.

260
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,280
It's not surprising that you are so considerate.

261
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,560
Don't stand there.

262
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,760
Sit down and eat with me.

263
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,840
Master,

264
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
this is the best one.

265
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,720
Why don't you drink it?

266
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Actually, I've already

267
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
had a little bit.

268
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,680
Master,

269
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
I'll tell you a secret.

270
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,040
Actually, every time I drink too much,

271
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,760
the grass in my hand

272
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
will grow faster

273
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,520
and higher than the house.

274
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
I once

275
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,120
scared my friends in the village.

276
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
From now on,

277
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,440
no matter how good the wine is,

278
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,320
I dare not drink it.

279
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm afraid of such strange things.

280
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
Fill it up.

281
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm here.

282
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I can't help you

283
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
with any strange things.

284
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,840
Don't worry.

285
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,160
It's delicious.

286
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,600
Master, you should try it too.

287
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
Although I can't do anything else,

288
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,720
I'm confident in the cooking

289
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
of wine.

290
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,560
No.

291
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
I remember now.

292
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,760
Master, you can't drink too much.

293
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,560
If that's the case,

294
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,520
then I'll drink it all.

295
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,000
It's fine.

296
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,080
I'll drink it all.

297
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm not a person who can't drink.

298
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm a person who can't drink.

299
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm not a person who can't compete with you.

300
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Master, I'm not afraid.

301
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,240
Even if you are cursed,

302
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,160
and become a pale face,

303
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,840
I won't be afraid.

304
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
Because I know,

305
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
Master, you are you.

306
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
Master asked me before,

307
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,920
what I was thinking when I was practicing the elixir.

308
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,400
I was thinking,

309
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,360
if I could

310
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,280
remove the curse on Master's face, that would be great.

311
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
I know I'm not that capable.

312
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,960
But in the future,

313
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
when I become stronger,

314
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,120
I will definitely practice an elixir

315
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,800
that can remove the curse on Master's face.

316
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Master,

317
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,040
I've always had a question.

318
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,800
I practice for the elixir.

319
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,200
But you've already

320
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,240
reached this level.

321
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
You still practice every day.

322
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
What is it for?

323
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
Because of one person.

324
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
I made some mistakes.

325
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,920
I want to make up for them.

326
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Then,

327
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,000
the person who made you do wrong,

328
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,640
do you hate him?

329
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,680
He disobeyed my permission,

330
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,460
and then he

331
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
disobeyed me.

332
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,520
How can you say I don't hate him?

333
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,840
But why,

334
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,040
I feel a little sad

335
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,640
when I see your eyes.

336
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

337
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
Xi'er said,

338
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,320
Master always has a taste

339
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,400
of the elixir that is broken tightly.

340
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,840
If a person is too tight,

341
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
he will be tired.

342
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,960
Why don't you taste

343
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
the sweet and sour medicine I made?

344
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,400
Sweeten it up and smile, okay?

345
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,440
We will

346
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,120
only eat sweet things.

347
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Xiaoshui,

348
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,440
stay with me in Mount Xi

349
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,800
and be happy for the rest of your life.

350
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,880
Master,

351
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
your face,

352
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,960
your curse is disappearing.

353
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,580
Mustafa goes to invite Master at night so we can have a break.

354
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,200
The night,

355
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,340
is not done yet.

356
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,740
If later on it is fated...

357
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,380
Your power

358
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,660
has been passed.

359
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,500
Where is she?

360
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,620
Where is she?

361
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,740
Xu Ran Ran.

362
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,740
Ran Ran.

363
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,940
Why are the flowers on the tree

364
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
growing here?

365
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't care about it.

366
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Let's find Ran Ran first.

367
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,860
In case she gets into trouble again

368
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,900
and gets us into trouble.

369
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,900
Xu Ran Ran.

370
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,620
Ran Ran.

371
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,420
Ran Ran.

372
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,140
Ran Ran.

373
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,220
Master,

374
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,260
they seem to have left.

375
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
Have you

376
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,420
remembered anything?

377
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,900
What?

378
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,660
I told you that

379
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,580
you have a beautiful woman.

380
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,020
You will definitely marry her.

381
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,980
But I didn't expect

382
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,860
you to be so beautiful.

383
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,500
You're drunk.

384
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,340
Master, just take a look.

385
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,060
Master,

386
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,780
Master,

387
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
I hold it tight.

388
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
He looks like he ism as well.

389
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,780
What should I do?

390
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I saw

391
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,640
You're wrong

392
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,180
I am not a good person

393
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,380
Why am I here?

394
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Who's there?

395
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Ran Ran.

396
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Why is she in my vision?

397
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,380
This is your soul master.

398
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,980
I came to his stone sea.

399
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,780
Is it because I'm good at cultivation

400
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,780
and I've made contact with you?

401
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,780
Who is she?

402
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
Do I know her?

403
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
You don't remember?

404
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Why is she trapped in this ice?

405
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,580
It seems like she's trapped in the ice.

406
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,380
Can you hear me?

407
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,380
Your soul is here.

408
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Look.

409
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,780
I don't know if you can hear me.

410
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,580
But I still want to thank you.

411
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Thank you for protecting me.

412
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,980
I'll protect Ling Xiao.

413
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,980
One day, I'll make him a perfect man for you.

414
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,180
I'll thank you in person.

415
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,980
Why am I as lonely as my master?

416
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,580
Although it's the first time we meet,

417
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,580
I think you're so close.

418
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,580
We must be fated to be close.

419
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,980
Are you my father?

420
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Alright.

421
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,380
I don't know why

422
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,780
you trapped yourself in this ice.

423
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,380
You must be bored.

424
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,780
How about I talk to you?

425
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,580
I have a secret.

426
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,180
I can't hold it anymore.

427
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,780
I must tell you.

428
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,380
I'll tell you secretly.

429
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
My master is so handsome.

430
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,380
He's the most handsome man in the world.

431
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,980
But I dare not tell him.

432
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,580
I can only tell you.

433
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,580
My master's eyes are so bright.

434
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,980
Like the stars in the sky.

435
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,580
My master's nose is so sharp.

436
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,380
Like the dangerous mountain wind,

437
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,180
he's so handsome.

438
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,380
His face is so beautiful.

439
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
I don't know

440
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,980
my master is so handsome.

441
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Who in the world

442
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,580
can match him?

443
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,380
The Legend of Chusen

444
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,380
Episode 17

445
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,580
Ling Xiao.

446
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,660
Did I just

447
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,180
get into your sea of ​​wisdom?

448
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,980
I'm not dreaming.

449
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,180
My master said that cultivation can help Ling Xiao.

450
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,780
Is it because recently

451
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,980
your spiritual power has been improved

452
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,980
and you can eat your spiritual food?

453
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,780
My master didn't lie to me.

454
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,980
Master.

455
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,380
Oh, no.

456
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,980
I'm drunk in front of my master.

457
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,580
I even turned into a ten-thousand-striped horse.

458
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,980
What should I do?

459
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,780
Sui Shui.

460
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
It's not what you think.

461
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,380
Don't argue.

462
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,580
Why did you say you left your master

463
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,580
in the West Mountain to cure him?

464
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,980
I think you have a different idea.

465
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,580
You just want to rely on you

466
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,980
while he's unconscious.

467
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,380
When master thinks of something,

468
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
he won't hate you anymore, right?

469
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,580
Don't think I don't know

470
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,180
your previous thoughts about master.

471
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,180
What you're doing now

472
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,980
is bullying his ignorance.

473
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,180
You're thinking too much.

474
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,980
I'm already in the heartless path.

475
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
I can't fall in love.

476
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,780
I won't fall in love.

477
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
I don't believe you.

478
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,380
You're a lunatic.

479
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
You can even throw your own internal energy pill.

480
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Maybe you'd rather

481
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,180
endure the pain of the ice lotus bow's counterattack

482
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,980
and achieve your own goal.

483
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,780
Even if the ice lotus counterattack can't stop me,

484
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,580
will I not care about

485
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,180
master's last wish?

486
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,980
You mean the seal of the spiritual power?

487
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,780
I owe him this.

488
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,380
I have to do it.

489
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,180
The seal of the spiritual power needs to be transformed into power.

490
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,980
The path will lead to the destruction of the palace.

491
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,180
So what you're worried about

492
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,780
won't happen at all.

493
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,980
You have time to stare at me.

494
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,980
You'd better think about

495
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,580
how to solve the soul lock.

496
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,180
Okay.

497
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,980
I'll believe you again.

498
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,980
But you must keep your word.

499
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,980
I'll always keep an eye on you.

500
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,980
I hope master will forgive me

501
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,380
for the sake of the food.

502
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
Ran Ran.

503
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,580
Why are you carrying the food box?

504
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,380
I'm going to send master a meal.

505
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,180
Send master a meal?

506
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,980
Ran Ran.

507
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
Is the wine not ready yet?

508
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,780
I'm going to send master a meal.

509
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,580
Send master a meal?

510
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,180
Ran Ran.

511
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,980
Is the wine not ready yet?

512
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,980
I'm going to send master a meal.

513
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,180
I'm not drunk.

514
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
I'll just drink it up.

515
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,780
Ran Ran, you're amazing.

516
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,780
You even let master open the door.

517
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,980
Of course.

518
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,980
I even helped master with the spell.

519
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,580
It's a good deed.

520
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,780
It seems that master won't punish me.

521
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Maybe he'll reward me.

522
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,780
Xuan Ran, master wants you to go to the Lotus Pool.

523
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,180
Mu Ran Wu Ji is about to be born.

524
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,580
The soul lock can't be taken off.

525
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,380
Fortunately, Ran Ran has been working hard these days.

526
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,580
The spirit stage has stabilized a lot.

527
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
It's not too late.

528
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,780
Go and see him now.

529
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
Okay.

530
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,780
Oh no.

531
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,780
How could this be?

532
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,780
The spirit stage still hasn't been restored.

533
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
We underestimated its power.

534
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,380
This soul lock is a bottomless hole.

535
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,780
The spirit stage can't be stabilized.

536
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,380
The soul lock can't be taken off.

537
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
The soul lock can't be taken off.

538
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,180
The soul stage can't be released.

539
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,780
There are dead ends all around.

540
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
What should we do?

541
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,180
The soul lock doesn't have to be taken off from Ran Ran.

542
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,180
You mean

543
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,380
it can be taken off from Mu Ran Wu?

544
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,380
Mu Ran Wu is about to be born.

545
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,180
Let's go to the mountain together.

546
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,580
Besides taking off the soul lock,

547
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,580
I also prepared a surprise for him.

548
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,980
Surprise?

549
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,380
Eighteen years ago,

550
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,980
he planned to steal Mu Qing Ge's spirit power.

551
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,380
He didn't leave any way for Mu Qing Ge on the immortal tree.

552
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,380
You still haven't seen his ambition?

553
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,980
He wants to become Mu Qing Ge.

554
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,380
He wants to become Mu Qing Ge.

555
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,980
He wants to become Mu Qing Ge.

556
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,180
Didn't you see it clearly?

557
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,980
He wants to become Mu Qing Ge.

558
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
Why don't we just fulfill his wish

559
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,180
and make him a real person?

560
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,580
Do you think Mu Qing Ge is that easy to be?

561
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,980
I just hope he doesn't regret it too soon.

562
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,380
Speaking of which,

563
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,180
the one who can't be at ease before he dies is the spirit power.

564
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,580
So I asked you to seal him back into the soul realm.

565
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,980
Although you set up a lot of spells

566
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,980
to control the spirit power before you were locked up,

567
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,580
you still didn't react to it at the same time.

568
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,980
We still don't know where the spirit power is.

569
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,380
Since we still don't have any clues here,

570
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
why don't we borrow it from him?

571
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,780
I have other plans when we go up the mountain.

572
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,380
Hurry up.

573
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Yes.

574
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,980
Elder Tu, what are you doing?

575
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,980
Honorable Superior,

576
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,780
I plan to send them to the Xuan Gate to investigate

577
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,180
and share your worries.

578
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Elder Tu,

579
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
you do have some power,

580
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
but it doesn't mean

581
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,780
you can surpass me and arrange the action without permission.

582
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,380
Remember, I'm the sect leader.

583
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,180
Don't be too far away.

584
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,780
Don't be too far away.

585
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,580
I just want to wait for the arrangement to be proper

586
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,180
and report to Honorable Superior.

587
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
No need.

588
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,780
The other fruit is about to fall.

589
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,580
This is our main goal.

590
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,580
I have a plan.

591
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,380
As for you,

592
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,980
just obey me.

593
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,780
I understand.

594
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
When the time comes,

595
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,780
I'll go up the mountain to meet them.

596
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,580
You wait for me at the bottom of the mountain.

597
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,380
Listen to my orders.

598
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
Yes.

599
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,780
The fruit of transformation is about to fall.

600
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,780
Your Highness,

601
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,380
you'll soon be able to fulfill your wish.

602
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,580
I'll go up the mountain to meet them.

603
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,580
Yes.

604
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,180
It's a pity that Ranran doesn't know about the sect,

605
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,980
or I could still bring my brother's favorite wine

606
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,580
to meet him.

607
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Your Highness,

608
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,180
these are the urgent letters from the capital.

609
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Your Highness,

610
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,180
is there something wrong in the palace?

611
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
It's still the Third Brother.

612
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
Your Highness,

613
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,780
the Third Prince's family

614
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,780
is just trying to do something.

615
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,980
Do they have any other schemes?

616
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,180
My father is in a critical condition.

617
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,380
I couldn't serve the soup in the prison.

618
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,180
They took advantage of this opportunity to make a big deal.

619
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
According to the palace,

620
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,980
His Majesty is indeed in a critical condition.

621
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm afraid...

622
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,580
I'm afraid that if he gets sick,

623
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
you'd better go back to the capital as soon as possible.

624
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,980
Why did he choose this time?

625
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,380
The state affairs are important.

626
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,780
The Crown Prince should return to the capital as soon as possible.

627
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
He shouldn't be delayed.

628
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,980
Last time,

629
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,780
the food and wine at the Chimen

630
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,180
were not prepared by the Third Prince.

631
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
This time,

632
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,380
we'll escort you back

633
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,580
to the capital.

634
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,780
Fine.

635
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,380
After I've finished handling the palace affairs,

636
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,380
I'll go to pick him up.

637
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,780
Master, you have something to do.

638
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,380
You'll train yourself today.

639
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
If you don't understand anything,

640
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,580
just ask me.

641
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,780
Yes, Master.

642
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
Listen to my command.

643
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,380
Duoyu.

644
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,580
What?

645
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,180
Master has gone down the mountain.

646
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,180
Is the Grand Master really going to come back?

647
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
What Grand Master?

648
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,780
Now, all the sects

649
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,380
and the demon monks at Chimen

650
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,580
are looking for the whereabouts of the spiritual power.

651
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,980
It's best for our disciples in Xishan

652
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,580
not to be with the devil Mu Qingge

653
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,380
and stick to the side.

654
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,180
I'll go to the palace.

655
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,180
Don't worry.

656
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,780
They say it's the master

657
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Mu Qingge

658
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,980
who summoned the spiritual power

659
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,780
and almost ruined the world.

660
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,980
But what is this spiritual power?

661
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Why is it so powerful?

662
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,580
This spiritual power

663
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,580
is the divine power

664
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,580
and power of the Demon King.

665
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Hundreds of years ago,

666
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
the immortal world surrounded the Demon King.

667
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,380
The Demon King was badly injured and fled.

668
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,780
He hid himself in the mortal world.

669
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,580
He founded the Xuantian Sect in Chiyan Mountain.

670
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,380
Thank you, Grand Master.

671
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,580
He caused a lot of evil and trouble.

672
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,980
Fortunately,

673
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,980
there's a rare talent in the mortal world.

674
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,980
Dun Tian,

675
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,580
the founder of the Nine-Flower Sect,

676
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,980
led the people of the Xuan Sect to attack Chiyan Mountain

677
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,580
and destroyed the Xuantian Sect.

678
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,380
He killed the Demon King and fled.

679
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,780
But the power and power of the Demon King

680
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,180
can't be destroyed.

681
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,380
All the immortals can only seal it together.

682
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,180
And this is the spiritual power.

683
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,180
Only Mu Qingge's Demon Lord

684
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,580
can summon the spiritual power.

685
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
And he can make the power of the spiritual power

686
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,980
the greatest.

687
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,380
No wonder the four schools are so afraid of him.

688
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,780
Yes.

689
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,380
If Mu Qingge is reborn,

690
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
he will definitely seek revenge from Master.

691
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,180
Will he hate Wu Ji and shame us?

692
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,580
Look at him.

693
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
He's so useless.

694
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Look at him.

695
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,180
He's so useless.

696
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,980
He's so evil.

697
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
How can the school

698
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,380
tolerate Mu Qingge, the Demoness,

699
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,980
and kill innocent people?

700
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,380
If you're afraid,

701
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,380
you can go down the mountain

702
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,780
and be a coward.

703
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,180
Is Mu Qingge really such a scary Demon?

704
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,380
When will I turn over so many books?

705
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,980
Move now.

706
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,780
Soul-てや3つ

707
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,980
Found it.

708
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,100
The one who knows each other

709
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,700
will lose his memory.

710
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,500
In the end,

711
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,100
we should practice harder

712
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,020
to help Ling Xiao to maintain his soul power

713
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,020
so that he can find some memories

714
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,420
related to the soul master.

715
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,180
Practice.

716
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,820
This is what Wing Archery can do.

717
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,860
Tenout.

718
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,420
Nineteen- zer?

719
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,980
Isn't this Master?

720
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:28,780
The moon is in the sky, I'm in the snow

721
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,780
The side of destiny is still the same

722
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,780
The wind and I are still the same

723
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,780
With you, I'm not afraid of the world

724
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,780
If I could be the one

725
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,780
I would be with you forever

726
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,780
I can't cross the sky

727
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,780
I wish I could turn back time to see you

728
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Why is it that I can't see you clearly

729
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,780
I chase you day and night

730
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,780
I only want to be with you day after day

731
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,780
If I could be the one

732
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,780
I would be with you forever

733
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,780
I can't cross the sky

734
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,780
I wish I could turn back time to see you

735
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,780
I once dreamed of meeting you

736
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,780
I was thinking of you

737
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,780
I said I would meet you in the future

738
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,780
I only want to be with you forever
