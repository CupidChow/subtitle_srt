1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
payments all.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to travel a few times

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
to travel between the north and the west.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
I will give you a thousand times of my life.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am destined to be with you.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
But I still have no fear or regret.

9
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,800
When the flowers wither and the clouds disappear,

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will slowly get to know you.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The Legend of Chusen

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 15

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Master has gone to the mountain to move the body.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Has he left?

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Didn't he just come to visit us?

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
I even made some delicious food.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
He said he wanted us to go down the mountain to practice the skills of the chicken and the bow.

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,000
But where exactly did he go?

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Master didn't tell him and left.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Ranran, where do you think we should go?

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
No way.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
The disciples of the Qingchuan Sect can't be so ungrateful.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
They have no plans in their hearts.

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
It's better to go to a place with a good view.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
The clouds of the clouds have been hanging from the morning until noon.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
It's beautiful.

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
It's a beautiful place to go.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Clouds of clouds?

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Didn't they just appear at a moment and then cover themselves by the clouds?

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,600
No, I moved a chair on purpose and watched it outside for half a day.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
You saw it too?

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Yes.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
The clouds of clouds were so big a few days ago.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Just like the birds of the clouds.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,000
There must be many lovers who have confessed their love to the clouds.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Why is it different from what I saw?

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Unless someone has cast a spell on you.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
But there are only a few people in our mountain.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Who would use this kind of method on you?

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,000
You must have seen it wrong.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Could it be that Master noticed my feelings for him

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
and deliberately wanted me to retreat?

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Ranran, what are you doing?

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm just relaxing.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm tired.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll just walk around.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
If Master hid from me on purpose,

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,400
then the mountain collapsed that time.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,000
The sword that protected me must be Master.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Since I was poisoned by the peach blossom,

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Master has been gone for so long.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
He didn't show up even for a few days.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
He even deliberately covered the clouds.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Please listen to my heart.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
I hope Master and I...

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
What does this mean?

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
It means...

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Master...

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Did he also break the sword?

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
It must be.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It seems that I'm not the only one who broke the sword.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
And Master...

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
The Taoism Seeker can also shake it.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll learn from him.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't be so impulsive next time.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I don't want to scare Master away.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Xie Ranran,

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you still have a chance to scare him away.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Ranran.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,600
Why are you hiding over there and smiling?

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm going down the mountain to practice.

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
Of course I'm happy to do good deeds.

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to be a good teacher.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,400
I will let Xie Ranran and Su Yishui

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
be together under your command.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Only then can I know where the spiritual power is.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Are you the immortal masters of West Mountain?

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes.

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm finally going down the mountain to meet the immortal masters of West Mountain.

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Recently,

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
there have been soldiers who died in the river where I fish.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
And they are so strange.

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,600
I beg you to go and have a look.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't be a monster who harms people.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
We're looking for a place to practice.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
What a coincidence.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
May I ask where the fishing spot is?

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Wangxiang Pass.

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
We know. We will definitely go.

90
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Thank you, immortal masters.

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
It's saved. It's saved.

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,800
We will enter the camp for the case of the death of the soldiers.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
But we can't enter the camp without any reason.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
There is such a strange thing in Wangxiang Pass.

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
We are going to the prison.

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
The four of us, the magical artists,

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
have prepared a very beautiful play.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
We want to get some money.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
If something strange happens now,

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
will we still go?

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes, leader. Will we still go?

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Yes, will we still go?

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
It's all about effort.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Let's go.

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Master, you've been looking at the signboard for a long time.

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
What's going on?

108
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Su Weishui, I'm talking to you.

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Where are you going?

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
There's a demon aura on the signboard.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I'll ask about the terrain.

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Chenchen.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
If we pretend to be the magical artists,

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
will we be exposed?

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
We will be exposed.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
We will be exposed.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,800
Will we be exposed?

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The soldiers are missing.

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,000
The general is afraid of disturbing the morale of the army and unwilling to grow.

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
We can only continue investigating like this.

121
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Don't worry. It's okay.

122
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Let's go.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Let's go.

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Is this the prison?

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Why are there so many fairy fish here?

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Did I find the wrong place?

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
The soldiers who are willing to die must hide themselves.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Of course, the fairy fish must be used to cover the position.

129
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
This is the place. Let's go.

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,000
The body was soaked in water and turned white.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
But the stomach is so big.

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
It must be a magic trick.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Here.

134
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Demon aura.

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
It's the demon who is doing evil.

136
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
What's the use of knowing these?

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Everything can be used to draw demons.

138
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,000
We are still the five-in-one.

139
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
I have a way to see the demon.

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Use the sword to track the body before it dies.

141
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Ranran really has you.

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I saw it.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I saw it.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The dead man was controlled to the river.

145
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
There is really a demon behind him.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,000
That monster is black.

147
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
It's like a tiger's tiger.

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Senior Gao Cang.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Your hometown is not far from Wangxiang Pass.

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Is there such a place here?

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Wangxiang Pass is a place

152
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
where many people died after the war.

153
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
The demon world was opened more than ten years ago.

154
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
And evil aura was around.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Plus, the border was in war every year.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,200
A dead jade was formed not far away.

157
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Dead jade?

158
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Yes.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:13,260
It's a mountain valley with a

160
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
If it's not a beast,

161
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,600
it looks like a cat.

162
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Maybe that demon is hiding in the camp.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Let's go around separately.

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
There must be a clue.

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Okay.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There is no blood.

167
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Let's summon the Immortals.

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Come.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Who summoned the bandits?

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
It's you.

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Over there.

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
There is a huge earthquake.

173
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,800
There is such a huge earthquake in the camp.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's that demon.

175
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
It's a demon.

176
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
It's a demon.

177
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
It's a demon.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a demon.

179
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
It's a demon.

180
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
It's a demon.

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's go.

182
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,400
Come with me.

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
There is a demon in the camp.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Aren't you the soldiers' soldiers?

185
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'll explain to you later.

186
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Come with me.

187
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's go.

188
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,800
Come on.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
Let's go.

190
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Come with me.

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
You.

192
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,200
You took away my toy a dozen years ago.

193
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
And that girl.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
She forced me to fold it for three hundred years.

195
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Now she's calling me.

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
There is a demon here.

197
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
According to the rules of the school,

198
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
the cultivator can summon the Immortals to ask me.

199
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,800
No.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,800
I can't listen.

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
I lost a drop of blood and got the Immortality.

202
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
I was afraid that I wouldn't cooperate.

203
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Since that,

204
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
I'll send you to the throne.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll take the chief position.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Then you'll follow me to find the demon.

207
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
You have to do it.

208
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,000
How dare you!

209
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Shameless!

210
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
He Fangya.

211
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Master.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
You too, you brat.

213
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll leave the Formation of the Deceased to you two.

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Goodbye.

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,000
This is really a demon.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
It's really a demon.

217
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
It's a little white-headed demon.

218
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Catch him.

219
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Misunderstanding.

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Misunderstanding.

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Little girl.

222
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Didn't you want to catch the demon?

223
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
This...

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
This is a warm-up.

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,840
This is the most famous

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
alchemist here.

227
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
What you just saw

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,600
is his warm-up trick.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Yes. Yes.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Everyone will wait for the real show later.

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Take the knife first.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
It's a warm-up.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's go.

234
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Yes.

235
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
You are the disciples of Qishan?

236
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

237
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
May I ask who you are?

238
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Qin Xuanjiu.

239
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,400
He's the last disciple of Master.

240
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
Greetings, Master Qin.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,800
So you're Su Yishui's disciple.

242
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
You're really mischievous.

243
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
You pretend to be the demon and enter my camp.

244
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,800
What are you going to do?

245
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm going to investigate the demon.

246
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Isn't there a soldier in the camp

247
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
who died of Qi's death?

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
We came down the mountain to investigate.

249
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
How do you know

250
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
that I'm a man of secret?

251
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
The demon blood is secretive.

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Of course, we need to investigate it more carefully.

253
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
I found a demon aura on Master.

254
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,600
No need to investigate.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
You go to another place to investigate.

256
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Leave immediately.

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Why do you have to change the place

258
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
when you don't investigate such a big monster?

259
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
When did I tell you to leave?

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,800
Leave now.

261
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,000
No.

262
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
You can't let me leave like this.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
Yes.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Master.

265
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Give me some water.

266
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Xue Ranran.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
The magic array of the spirit of the dead

268
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
is the main one.

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
I stepped on the main position.

270
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
Master stepped on the main position.

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Isn't it?

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Yes.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Don't ask anymore.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Master, it's not my fault.

275
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,200
Anyway, it's like this.

276
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
I want to investigate, but you can't catch me.

277
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,800
So

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
I can only stay with you.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
You little girl is interesting.

280
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Just stay here.

281
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
Seeing Su Yishui eating the whip,

282
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
I feel so happy.

283
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
But

284
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
the Su Yishui gourd thing

285
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
is said to have a demon aura.

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,400
You also found the demon aura.

287
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
What is the demon aura that Master found?

288
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
I killed the soldiers.

289
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
It's the same demon that destroyed the gourd.

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,800
Master Qin.

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,400
Do you have a cat in the camp?

292
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I picked one up.

293
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
It's a wild one.

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
But it's weak.

295
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
It's not as strong as a cat.

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,400
Do you have a scratch on your arm?

297
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,600
No.

298
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
What's wrong?

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
It's interesting.

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
Ranran.

301
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Master.

302
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Let's talk about something else.

303
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
It seems that we are really going to perform magic.

304
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
They just used magic to turn the field.

305
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,200
It's very beautiful.

306
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,400
We are waiting for you to perform the magic.

307
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Master Qin, this...

308
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,400
The thing just now was too big.

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
I can't get over it.

310
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,400
You guys

311
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
just find a way to deal with it.

312
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,800
I'll go to perform the magic.

313
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,400
Ranran, what should we do?

314
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
I think we should go to the camp.

315
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
I think we should go to the camp.

316
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I have an idea.

317
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
You want to see the magic?

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,600
Okay.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
But the next performance

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
needs your cooperation.

321
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
As long as it's beautiful,

322
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
we are willing to cooperate with you.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Am I right?

324
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

325
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Please raise your hands high.

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Why do you want us to raise our hands?

327
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
Are we going to

328
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
steal the ball and get married?

329
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't worry.

330
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
This performance

331
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
will guarantee that

332
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
everyone will have a garden.

333
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Okay.

334
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
That's great.

335
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
That's great.

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
That's great.

337
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Master, don't worry.

338
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
It's amazing.

339
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
It's really amazing.

340
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,600
It's amazing.

341
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,600
It's amazing.

342
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Look.

343
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,600
It's gone.

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is it gone?

345
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
What's going on?

346
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,200
It's gone.

347
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh no.

348
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
Ranran's spiritual power is not enough.

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh no.

350
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I just used the sword.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
My spiritual power is too high.

352
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,400
Don't cry.

353
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:35,500
It's゚

354
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Good, good, good!

355
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,100
Come, come, come!

356
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,900
Good, good!

357
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,300
Good, good, good!

358
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
You can do it, you can do it!

359
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Good, good, good!

360
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Don't grab, there's no more.

361
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,100
Good, good, good!

362
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
One, two, three.

363
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,300
Good, good, good!

364
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,100
You can do it too, good, good!

365
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Good, good, good!

366
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
Good, good, good!

367
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,100
You lose, you lose.

368
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
Let's see who's going to win.

369
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Bravo!

370
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Bravo!

371
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Come, come, come.

372
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Ran Ran.

373
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Uncle Qian.

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Why did you ask me to hold this banquet?

375
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
To investigate the case of Uncle Chen Ji.

376
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Investigate the case?

377
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
What do you want to do?

378
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Master, I'll go over first.

379
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Let's go.

380
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Master.

381
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Come, come, come.

382
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Okay, thank you.

383
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Swim.

384
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Miss, it's boring to drink and swim now.

385
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Drink and play.

386
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Let's play first.

387
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
The real man who sees the garden.

388
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
That's right.

389
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
The ones in the back are all famous masters.

390
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
The cards are smaller than the big ones.

391
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
It's a long story.

392
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Since we can get some fresh air.

393
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
We can have fun.

394
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Come, let's play a game.

395
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Let's play a game.

396
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Okay.

397
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
The great disciple of Jiuhua Sect, Yan Liangyu.

398
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I call the female immortal of Kongshan, Wen Hongshan.

399
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I'm more important than you.

400
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Jiuhua is the first school in the world.

401
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
If Yan Liangyu is a great disciple.

402
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Why are you so big?

403
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Master Yan is loyal to Master Wen.

404
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
The love is in the heart.

405
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Naturally, he is loved by others.

406
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
It makes sense.

407
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I call the leader of Feiyun Sect, Lu Yun.

408
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
A sect of masters.

409
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
There's no one bigger than him.

410
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Su Yishui, the chief of the West Mountain Sect.

411
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
All the four great scholars can't do anything.

412
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm the biggest one.

413
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
You all wait to drink.

414
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
You are the dog's shit.

415
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Even Su Yishui, the devil, was beaten by you.

416
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Little girl, it's your turn.

417
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Su Yishui has been drawn.

418
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I think you're not far from the punishment.

419
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I won.

420
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I drew.

421
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
It's Master Mu Qingge, the master of Su Zongzhu.

422
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Let's drink.

423
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Okay, okay, okay.

424
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll drink.

425
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Come back.

426
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I heard that Wang Xiangguan is a knight.

427
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
What's the news recently?

428
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
If you talk about the news,

429
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
it's just that our school is in the dark.

430
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Let's drink together.

431
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
It's a pity that those brothers who are on patrol

432
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
have missed the fun of the hundred years.

433
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I haven't seen him come back.

434
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I don't know what kind of trouble it is.

435
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Do those on patrol have any common points?

436
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Nothing else.

437
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
But those on patrol are all from the Xinjiawei.

438
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Slow down.

439
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
The little girl is so good at playing cards.

440
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It's so interesting that she doesn't lose.

441
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Besides, you're so pretty.

442
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Why don't you drink with us?

443
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
That's right.

444
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
The rules of the restaurant are to drink after losing.

445
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
I don't drink with you.

446
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
You don't drink with me?

447
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
If you don't drink with me,

448
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll just have to make you laugh.

449
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Sirs,

450
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
why did you fall down after drinking too much?

451
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Put the knife away first.

452
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
How about this?

453
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll try my best to feed you.

454
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Drink more.

455
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Drink more.

456
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Did you forget that you'll get a sore throat after drinking?

457
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
It doesn't matter if it's just one bowl.

458
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I have to check it.

459
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Master, your alcohol tolerance...

460
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I don't like it.

461
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Good alcohol tolerance.

462
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
See you.

463
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Master, you're...

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
drinking for me?

465
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
After you moved,

466
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Su Yishui, you really came to Wangxiang Pass.

467
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
It seems that you don't need me to work hard.

468
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Just be a yellow-tailed duck.

469
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Master.

470
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
There are no guests tonight.

471
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
You guys go to the inn with me.

472
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
But Master hasn't woken up yet.

473
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Don't look at me.

474
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
He's your master.

475
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I don't care.

476
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Sorry, Master.

477
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Please.

478
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Okay.

479
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Su Yishui.

480
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
You have today.

481
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Zhenya.

482
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Zhenya.

483
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
After Master wakes up,

484
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll know that you must suffer.

485
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Godmother.

486
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Godmother.

487
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Xuan Jiu.

488
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Are you here to take your friend to stay?

489
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
A friend who is ill.

490
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
This is the inn my godmother opened.

491
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
You live here.

492
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I have a tent.

493
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
When Master went down the mountain,

494
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
he was in a hurry like a ghost.

495
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
He didn't even bring money.

496
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Master went down the mountain in a hurry?

497
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Yes.

498
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
He was in a hurry like a fire.

499
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Since he's Xuan Jiu's friend,

500
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
he's his family.

501
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
You can live here as you like.

502
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Please.

503
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Let's go.

504
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Master Qin said you went down the mountain in a hurry.

505
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Why?

506
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
He must have known my intention

507
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
and went down the mountain to avoid me.

508
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Avoid me?

509
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
You can't help but be nice to me?

510
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I must find a way

511
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
to make Master understand.

512
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Master, you're awake.

513
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
You've been practicing for a year.

514
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
You've improved a lot.

515
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
You've learned to deal with me.

516
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Do you really think I can't leave you

517
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
with the Curse of the Dead?

518
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Master,

519
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I didn't set up the formation on purpose.

520
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I didn't want to make you angry.

521
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm investigating the case of Wang Xiangguan.

522
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
If I can't save him in time,

523
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
it would be a pity.

524
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Master.

525
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I made you something delicious.

526
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Try it.

527
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
It's very delicious.

528
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Please, Master.

529
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Thank you.

530
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Is it delicious?

531
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
This is my new-made dried durian.

532
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I got it all from you.

533
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
You can have more of each dish.

534
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
You can add more soup.

535
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
I remember it all.

536
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
It must be delicious.

537
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
So, Master,

538
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
for the sake of my effort,

539
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
please let me stay.

540
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
I only want you to stay until

541
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
the Curse of the Dead is gone.

542
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Thank you, Master.

543
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Master,

544
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
there's one thing I don't understand.

545
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Why did the Immortal know me?

546
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Is it related to my past life?

547
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
It's all about your past life.

548
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Why do you ask?

549
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
I understand.

550
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
But I...

551
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Lu Xiaoteng and I...

552
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I saw that...

553
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Master wanted to kill me.

554
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Your memory is recovering.

555
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Master,

556
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,500
was I a bad person in the past life?

557
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
No.

558
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
You're very nice.

559
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Are you trying to

560
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
settle the debt of disrespect

561
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
to me and punish you?

562
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
I won't ask.

563
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Master can't beat me

564
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
with the ring anyway.

565
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Master Qin.

566
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
You're drunk.

567
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
You're awake.

568
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
What did you find out?

569
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Did the cat you raised

570
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
hurt you?

571
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
How do you know?

572
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
The scratches on Master Qin's arm

573
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
are three times shorter.

574
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
It must be a cat that hurt a cat.

575
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I just saw in the camp

576
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
that there were many people

577
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
with such scratches.

578
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
There's only one cat in the camp.

579
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
When everyone was fighting with cats,

580
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
they were hurt.

581
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
What's so strange about that?

582
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
The scratches on the dead soldiers

583
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
are a few times longer,

584
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
but they're three times shorter.

585
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
If the monster also hurt a cat,

586
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
it's too coincidental.

587
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
With the spirit of the monster,

588
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
it can be calculated that

589
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
the cat of Master Qin is a monster.

590
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
No.

591
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I've been raising the cat for so many years.

592
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
It won't hurt anyone.

593
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
The missing soldiers in the camp

594
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
were only half a year old.

595
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
If the cat is a monster,

596
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
why didn't you kill it earlier?

597
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
It's a step back.

598
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
If it's going to hurt someone,

599
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
there are so many people in the camp.

600
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Why would you go to the river?

601
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
It's not the same thing

602
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
if it's a monster.

603
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Yes.

604
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
It's not the same thing

605
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
if it's a monster.

606
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
It's not wrong for a cat to be a monster.

607
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
But whether it's going to hurt someone

608
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
is another question.

609
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Thank you, Master.

610
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Master Qin,

611
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
take this spirit of the monster.

612
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
When you see the cat, stick it to it.

613
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
If it's a monster,

614
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
you can do it immediately.

615
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
If it's a waste of time,

616
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
you don't have to

617
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
worry about my business in the camp tomorrow.

618
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Ranran,

619
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
you said that it's not the same thing

620
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
if it's going to hurt someone or a monster.

621
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
What about the cat?

622
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
What should we do?

623
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
When I was performing,

624
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I borrowed the peach petals from the cat

625
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
and added a spell to every soldier in the camp.

626
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
It doesn't matter if the cat is the murderer.

627
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Since it likes to manipulate people

628
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
to kill people by the river,

629
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
once the soldiers are hit by the monster,

630
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
these branches

631
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
can help us to get it.

632
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Master, where are you going?

633
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
I'm going to the cave.

634
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm going to the cave.

635
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
I'm going to the cave.

636
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
I'm going to the cave.

637
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Where are you going, Yuan Feng?

638
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm going to investigate your case.

639
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
It's a very light resentment.

640
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I can't tell it until I get close to the river.

641
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,500
The Luo Pan City is damaged by the monster.

642
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
There's resentment in the river.

643
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Let's see what we can find

644
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
from the resentment.

645
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Let's go.

646
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Meiqiu,

647
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I died for

648
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
the sake of putting someone's mouth on the water.

649
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I knew it.

650
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Meiqiu is not a monster.

651
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Su Yishui!

652
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Su Yishui!

653
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Su Yishui!

654
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Master.

655
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Where's Su Yishui?

656
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Master went out last night.

657
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
How is Master Qin?

658
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
I...

659
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Master Qin,

660
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
did the black cat touch the golden demon suit?

661
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
It's a big one.

662
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Did it hurt anyone?

663
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Did it hurt Meiqiu?

664
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
No, Master.

665
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
It's in its original form.

666
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
You still say it doesn't hurt anyone?

667
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I said it won't hurt.

668
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I...

669
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Xuan Jiu,

670
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
what are you yelling at this early morning?

671
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Godmother,

672
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I was in a hurry.

673
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
What's the hurry with friends?

674
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
It's late.

675
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Come down and have breakfast.

676
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Don't eat and don't talk.

677
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Come on.

678
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
You can't eat it if it's too late.

679
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
This is the last one for today.

680
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
You are lucky.

681
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
The buns made by my godmother

682
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
are very similar to each other.

683
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
My brothers and I often eat them.

684
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
You just blow these for me.

685
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
You guys eat slowly.

686
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Ranran,

687
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
go and have some porridge.

688
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
I'll ask Godmother to make more tomorrow.

689
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
May I ask,

690
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
why would Master Qin appoint Wu Niang as Godmother?

691
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Wu Niang was my godmother

692
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
because of my brother.

693
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
But she didn't come back

694
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
after she was examined.

695
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
So my godmother is gone.

696
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
It's good to have a godmother.

697
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Ranran,

698
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
is your Jinyang Prefecture

699
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
accurate?

700
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Did something go wrong?

701
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
It won't go wrong.

702
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500
But it's not her who killed the soldiers.

703
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Really?

704
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Pei Mao slept in Master Qin's study.

705
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
But the spell didn't work.

706
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
It means nothing happened.

707
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
And after Jinyang Prefecture

708
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
forced her out of the circle,

709
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
she would be violent and violent.

710
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
She would be very aggressive.

711
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
And Master Qin was right in front of her.

712
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
But the black cat just ran away.

713
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
It means she was being aggressive.

714
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
She's not a monster who can harm people.

715
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
This situation

716
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
doesn't make sense.

717
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
What do you think?

718
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
What should we do?

719
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
We have to wait.

720
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
When there are more evil spirits in the camp,

721
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
I will activate my spell.

722
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Then everything will be fine.

723
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Something's wrong.

724
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
There are soldiers in the camp

725
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
who are poisoned by the evil spell.

726
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Let's follow the peach blossoms.

727
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
We can find the evil monster.

728
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
But Master Qin is not back yet.

729
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
It's an emergency.

730
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Where can we wait?

731
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
It's okay.

732
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
It's not a plum blossom.

733
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
There are soldiers who are poisoned by the evil spell.

734
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
The evil monster is nearby.

735
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Once it appears,

736
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
we will use the Niyuan Formation

737
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
to make a formation.

738
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Wake up.

739
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Wake up.

740
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Wake up.

741
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Wake up.

742
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Come on.

743
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Get up.

744
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Did you hear

745
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,180
Senior, get September Br pedestrians for us.

746
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Officer.

747
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,900
Oh god.

748
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,400
Focus.

749
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,540
Hurry!

750
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,140
Around creature

751
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,700
collision

752
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,220
this is master's sz

753
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,740
This kanji block

754
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,020
can help us get incharge

755
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,020
Master's法纳

756
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,420
I'll let Ran Ran have her back.

757
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,360
Xue'er

758
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,320
Why is it like this?

759
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,440
This is not good.

760
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,800
I can't save them if I take revenge myself.

761
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,600
Yi Qi...

762
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,120
Pusheistles!

763
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,400
Yi Qi...

764
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,440
Yi Qi and P carbs.

765
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,360
Someone used that drill

766
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,060
took the energy with my soul,

767
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,760
and it's still alive after being deceived.

768
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,360
Madam bank...

769
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
The soul is still here.

770
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,580
Everything must be mine in this life.

771
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
You 내가 injured.

772
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,360
It's just a little weak. It's fine.

773
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,360
You learned this magic from Xiao Tong's stone sea?

774
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,360
You will slowly remember everything from before.

775
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Don't use this magic trick again.

776
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
Didn't I use it in my previous life?

777
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,360
All tricks are based on your own body.

778
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
You don't have enough cultivation.

779
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Using this magic trick to borrow external power will hurt yourself.

780
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,360
External power? Where did I borrow it from?

781
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,360
You just need to know that before the elixir is not completed, you can't use it again.

782
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Also, don't mention everything you saw to anyone else.

783
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
I know.

784
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
What happened just now? Where did those fish go?

785
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
That fish was hurt and ran away.

786
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Teacher.

787
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,360
It's a half-man half-fish monster controlling the fish.

788
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,360
The magic of the Demon Beast is limited. It will never turn into a human.

789
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
How can there be a half-man half-fish monster?

790
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Ran Ran, you must have seen it wrong.

791
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,360
When I fought with it, I saw it very clearly. It will never be wrong.

792
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Also...

793
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
It's a human.

794
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
This is not clear.

795
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Don't come near me.

796
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Revenge?

797
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
That's right.

798
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,360
The fish monster doesn't have demon aura. It's revenge.

799
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
At least you guessed it right.

800
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,360
The fish monster is hurting people. The cat monster is saving people.

801
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Then the cat monster did stop us.

802
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
The cat monster has already discovered the truth of the fish monster hurting people.

803
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Its sister rushed to the riverside to catch those soldiers who were controlled.

804
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,360
That's why it left a mark on the dead.

805
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Then the strange sound we heard is the demon's evil magic?

806
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
It's also a grudge.

807
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
When did we get grudges too?

808
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Ran Ran, why are you okay?

809
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
We've been together all this time.

810
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,360
The only difference between us...

811
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Buns. It's buns.

812
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Master Qin said that soldiers in the camp love buns too.

813
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
If the grudge is eaten by the buns,

814
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,360
the strange sound will be heard and the control will go to the riverside.

815
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,360
If the buns are wrong, then...

816
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Let's wake up the soldiers first.

817
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Wake up.

818
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,360
The grudge is related to the spiritual power.

819
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
But how did it happen?

820
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
It's the deities.

821
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Thank you for saving me.

822
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,360
About the buns, have you eaten the buns of Wu Niang recently?

823
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
I have.

824
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,360
What's the relationship between you and those missing soldiers?

825
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Five years ago, we were in a small team.

826
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
It was only half a month ago.

827
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,360
How many soldiers are there in this team except you?

828
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
There's one more.

829
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:50,960
Please,

830
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,360
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,360
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
I'm sorry.

847
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I'm sorry.

850
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I'm sorry.

852
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm sorry.

855
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
I'm sorry.

856
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm sorry.

857
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
I'm sorry.

858
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,360
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,360
I'm sorry.

872
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm sorry.

874
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,360
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,360
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,360
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,360
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,360
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm sorry.

889
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
I'm sorry.

890
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm sorry.

894
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I'm sorry.

895
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
I'm sorry.

896
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,360
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
I'm sorry.
