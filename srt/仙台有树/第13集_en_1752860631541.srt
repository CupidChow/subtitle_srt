1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
All terrible things happened in our world today.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,800
It was our fate that led us into this world.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,460
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,840
To the end of the world.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,220
Our best wishes.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,660
Yes.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
For all the people in our world,

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,900
including you,

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,700
and your parents,

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,780
we always wish you a happy end of the adventure.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,460
Thanks to you.

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,900
Thank you for being there for us.

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,160
We're grateful.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,860
Thanks.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm so sorry.

86
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

87
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

88
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

89
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

90
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

91
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

92
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

93
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

94
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

95
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

96
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

97
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

98
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

99
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I Republican mouse get you right.

100
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,300
And now it's all over.

101
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,280
It's not over.

102
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,860
This is too much.

103
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,320
This is enough.

104
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,840
Boss Fu?

105
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,660
Aren't you here to save Su Mo?

106
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,320
You really won't hit Su Mo?

107
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,160
You think he doesn't know we're blood lace professionals.

108
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,040
You think he won't be safe to stand under the sun?

109
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm not worth it.

110
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I don't deserve it.

111
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
You can fool others.

112
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,080
You can fool yourself.

113
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,280
You spend the whole day together.

114
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,360
How can you fight it?

115
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,560
If you keep doing this, you'll be out of control sooner or later.

116
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
Look at you now.

117
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
The Ice Palace will kill you.

118
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm fine.

119
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm fine.

120
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm fine.

121
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm fine.

122
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
I'm fine.

123
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
I'm fine.

124
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm fine.

125
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm fine.

126
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm fine.

127
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,280
Although you're doing this to yourself,

128
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
but...

129
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,920
I can't bear to see it.

130
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Besides,

131
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,600
can you manage to seal the spiritual spring?

132
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,400
I think about the task of sealing the spring day and night.

133
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
It's much more important than you remember.

134
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
From now on,

135
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
you'll be in charge of the cultivation.

136
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
I'll avoid it completely.

137
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll never appear before her again.

138
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Don't worry.

139
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,160
I promised to do as I said.

140
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Why didn't I get the same information

141
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
when Mr. Yu came that day?

142
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I wasn't upset about his affection for the Immortal of the Tomb.

143
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,880
Instead, I saw so many female Immortal

144
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,320
came for Master.

145
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,200
I felt a little sad.

146
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
I didn't feel good.

147
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Besides,

148
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,280
when I offended Master during the day...

149
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Although I was a little rude,

150
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,320
the scent of Master's body was really good.

151
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,400
His eyebrows and his nose...

152
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
Xiu Ran Ran, what are you thinking?

153
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
You're so mean.

154
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
You forgot the two words of shame.

155
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,400
I almost forgot.

156
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,080
How to chant the Waning Spell?

157
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,560
Why is there Master's face and body in my head?

158
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
I forgot the Waning Spell.

159
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Ling Xiao,

160
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
I can only rely on you now.

161
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Although I was drunk during the day,

162
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
I was just a little rude.

163
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
But actually,

164
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm a little happy.

165
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
What's going on?

166
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Did I really want to do it

167
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,880
and was driven by that magical machine?

168
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,320
Do you think my reaction is...

169
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I haven't said it yet. How do you know what I want to ask?

170
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,560
Do you think I like Master?

171
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Really?

172
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
But what if I like him?

173
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
Master must like the new Luyu.

174
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Ran Ran.

175
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Master.

176
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
Your Master is practicing in the closed door.

177
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
No one is here.

178
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,600
By the way, this is for you.

179
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Ran Ran.

180
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,960
You are in the training period.

181
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,880
After that, you will be a assistant.

182
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,520
If you are a bad assistant,

183
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,240
you will be like a tree root.

184
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,200
It will directly affect your practice.

185
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,400
You are fast in the practice of the spirit.

186
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,280
So you must know that

187
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
the great light and the well-lit scene is right in front of you.

188
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,000
You must not let the practice go wrong because of the other things.

189
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,160
You don't want to lose your Master's face

190
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
because of the bad practice, right?

191
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Remember.

192
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,400
You must be careful with the words in the book.

193
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,880
You must learn the meaning of the painting.

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,920
I know, Master.

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
I will study it carefully.

196
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,880
Then, please take this fish for me.

197
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

198
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,160
Thank you, Master.

199
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
What?

200
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
The disciple loves his Master.

201
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,960
He will be struck by lightning?

202
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
So cruel.

203
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,240
He even said that Master was the master of love.

204
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,600
That's why they couldn't go to the mountain.

205
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
Wait.

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
Uncle told me

207
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,440
to study the meaning of the painting more.

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,480
The story is said to be

209
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,360
the disciple missing his Master.

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,440
But if you think about it,

211
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
it means that

212
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,560
so many people miss their Master.

213
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,520
So there is more than one person who misses his Master.

214
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,600
Ling Xiao, is that what you mean?

215
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
The Master is in seclusion.

216
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
You are not allowed to disturb him.

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
Master Yuchen.

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
If Master doesn't want to eat,

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
will he want to eat some snacks?

220
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,280
I haven't had time to send out

221
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
the dragon seed cake I made last time.

222
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
The Master never likes to eat dragon seed cake.

223
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Then I will put it on the table.

224
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
If Master wants to eat,

225
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,000
he can take it at any time.

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
How could this person be my sister's sword master?

227
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Who are you?

228
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Who sent you here?

229
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
Don't you recognize me?

230
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Qingge, it's me.

231
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Zhou Fei Hua.

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,680
Zhou Fei Hua?

233
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,720
The woman who is under the control of Zhan Niang

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
is Zhou Mei Ren.

235
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,920
This...

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
This is...

237
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
This is...

238
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
This is...

239
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
This is...

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
This is...

241
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
This is...

242
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
This is...

243
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
This is...

244
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
This is...

245
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
This...

246
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,520
You taught me how to wield a sword.

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You said that

248
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
you would come to the competition

249
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,560
after you came back.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
I always remember this promise.

251
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
I have been reborn

252
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
and lost too much spiritual power.

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,160
I can't remember

254
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,600
many things.

255
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,400
Qingge doesn't recognize Fei Hua?

256
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,600
Your Highness.

257
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,960
Not only does she have a strong impression of Zhou Mei Ren,

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
she is no longer like before.

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
She is just like before.

260
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,320
I thought she had a friend in the palace

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
who could be less annoying.

262
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,360
I didn't expect her to not recognize her.

263
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
Your Highness, don't worry.

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
Although Your Highness can't remember Zhou Mei Ren,

265
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
you still have the chance to be with those disciples.

266
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,000
I think you won't be lonely.

267
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
She is very loyal.

268
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,160
She comes back and continues to take care of the disciples.

269
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
But she has many disciples.

270
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm afraid that she can't stay in the Eastern Palace anymore.

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,440
She needs to clean up my house outside the palace.

272
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,360
Your Highness.

273
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,360
Her Highness only appointed Wang Sui Zhi as the successor.

274
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,600
The rest of them are all outside the palace.

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,840
Wang Sui Zhi?

276
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes.

277
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,600
The one who can see the luck and wealth

278
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,960
running the first wife of the nine-story building in the capital.

279
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
That's right.

280
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,520
And Her Highness also promised

281
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,920
to take Lin Ye Ting as a disciple

282
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
of the eldest son of Prime Minister Lin.

283
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
No one in the capital knows that Lin Ye Ting

284
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
is a stubborn and uneducated woman.

285
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
How could Qing Ge take her as a disciple?

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
You guys are still good.

287
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
You know how to be filial.

288
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
All of you, get up.

289
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Thank you, Master.

290
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,360
Wang Sui Zhi?

291
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,280
I remember that you used to be very good at looking at fortune.

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
You can dig a hole in a treasure

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,120
with just one glance.

294
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
Do you still have that ability?

295
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Of course.

296
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,640
It's just that Master once said

297
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
that this is the ability of a master.

298
00:10:49,920 --> 00:11:04,680
You can't be too

299
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Why are you looking for him?

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
After the war,

301
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,920
Xiao Wu's whereabouts were unknown.

302
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,400
He was useless.

303
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,200
We couldn't find him.

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,800
Fortunately,

305
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
you're back now.

306
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
You must have a way.

307
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,440
You're thoughtful.

308
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
But you don't have to look for him.

309
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
He's already dead in the nine-story building.

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Xiao Wu is already dead?

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,160
Remember.

312
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
There's no one else in this world.

313
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,520
Just a little bit.

314
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,680
You don't have a good appetite.

315
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Or do you have any worries?

316
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,320
No.

317
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,120
Father fell ill on the battlefield.

318
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,560
His health is getting worse.

319
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,000
Today, he proposed

320
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,200
a medicine for you to take.

321
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,640
Medicine?

322
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I know that you've just taken the poison of the water of the abyss.

323
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,840
You haven't fully recovered.

324
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,000
So I've already informed Father.

325
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,480
It's not urgent.

326
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,840
You have to take it when you're well.

327
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,360
I'll take it when I'm well.

328
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I've already got the power to solve it.

329
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,720
It shouldn't be a problem to make a pill.

330
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
I see.

331
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,960
I heard that you've picked a medicine for me.

332
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
What a coincidence.

333
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,120
I've also prepared a gift for you.

334
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,080
Okay.

335
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
It's a South Sea Night Tip.

336
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,200
It's the eatable one for 1000 years.

337
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,920
The treasures passed down by the royal families for generations.

338
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
It matches the best with your identity as crown prince.

339
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
I think you'll definitely like it.

340
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,600
Yes, Your Highness.

341
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,800
What are you gifting to me?

342
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,040
Come.

343
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,360
The pearl pendant His Majesty bestowed on me.

344
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,760
You've given me such a precious thing.

345
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
It's good that you like it.

346
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,420
The Revolution

347
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,340
von Christmas

348
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,880
I don't know when Your Majesty

349
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,120
can recover from the cancer.

350
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,280
I wish I could marry you soon.

351
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
I came all the way

352
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,280
to see you.

353
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,480
You won't let me down.

354
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
Qin Ge.

355
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Your hand

356
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,040
I will protect you.

357
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
If you feel bored in the palace,

358
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,000
you can go to find Feihua

359
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
and ask for help.

360
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,040
Him?

361
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
He's just a rough man

362
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,920
who can only dance.

363
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,560
He only wants to take care of the whole family

364
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
and be the crown prince's concubine.

365
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,240
Luckily, I'm back.

366
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,880
I didn't let him win.

367
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,680
Hua is a good girl.

368
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,280
We are like old friends.

369
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,920
But this place is not for

370
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
a simple-minded person like her.

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,960
I don't want her to be a victim of politics.

372
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
You must protect her.

373
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,040
What's wrong?

374
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,160
I suddenly thought

375
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
there are some things to deal with.

376
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,560
I'll come to see you next time.

377
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
Why are you here all of a sudden?

378
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm here to return you five arrows.

379
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,800
You used to see me

380
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,400
to catch Mu Xianshi.

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,040
But now he's in the palace.

382
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,480
Why should I...

383
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,120
He's back.

384
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,120
But he's different from what I remember.

385
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,720
He used to

386
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,360
think for others.

387
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,280
Now he's reborn.

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
But he's doing it for himself.

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,560
It's not a bad thing.

390
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
It's different to

391
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
live again.

392
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,720
He's been through a lot of changes.

393
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,160
It takes time to get used to it.

394
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,760
When he's recovered,

395
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,840
I'll drink with him.

396
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,240
Too assured.

397
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Ming Dann.

398
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Xiao Cheng프

399
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,000
and and Rong Laosi

400
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,240
planned to London

401
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,960
to participate in Beijing Arts and Entertainment ada fel beginning of September.

402
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Master Steward Yu Tong

403
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
pi

404
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,920
In shotgun

405
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,160
In shotgun

406
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,400
be ingredients

407
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
I made nothing to compare to your own work.

408
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,980
His Graph Graphic [( for Go tomorrow 尽快买)]

409
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,700
You didn't want even start making it yourself, Master?

410
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,620
Well...

411
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,960
recommending it was incomplete right away.

412
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,140
Oh, yeah,

413
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,900
I didn't expect that Junior Sister

414
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,420
would get the first prize.

415
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,100
We just started practicing.

416
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,260
Ran Ran is already in the mid-term.

417
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,700
How can she not get the first prize?

418
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,740
I didn't expect that

419
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,540
Ran Ran's power has improved so fast.

420
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,660
We have to hurry up and practice.

421
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,580
This is a new method

422
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
for practicing Wu Xiang Ling Gen

423
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
that is being used in Mount Xishan.

424
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,020
It can help you to stabilize your foundation

425
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,620
by using this unique spiritual aura

426
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,660
and ground pattern in the ancient tomb.

427
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,060
For the next half year,

428
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,220
you need to practice for three hours

429
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,340
in the ancient tomb every day.

430
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,300
I will give you the protection

431
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
in the ancient tomb.

432
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,060
Didn't you say that as the first disciple,

433
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,140
you can get the protection from Master?

434
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,780
Master has been locked up for so long.

435
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,940
Haven't you broken through it?

436
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,020
It's Liam,

437
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,700
you young guy.

438
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,420
I will let you rest now, Sh sle.

439
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,060
How's it going?

440
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,340
Have you memorized everything?

441
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,300
Let's get started.

442
00:20:47,300 --> 00:21:08,060
into all the

443
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,460
Primeval Mountains.

444
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,980
Only after dripping the migrate seed

445
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,580
Su Yi Shui, I will settle this score with you.

446
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,740
Greetings, Demon Lord.

447
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,220
Rise.

448
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,660
Thank you, Demon Lord.

449
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,740
Have you found the spiritual power?

450
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,940
I've been searching the mortal world for a year,

451
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,300
but I still can't find it.

452
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,940
I've been in seclusion for more than a year.

453
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,380
Why don't you tell me about it?

454
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,940
Who are these people?

455
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,900
Time to pee.

456
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,280
Yes, I'm dóngsh،

457
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,840
Since you did good at defending the ugly,

458
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,100
remember this andρέate.

459
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,020
Yeah?

460
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,500
As soon as we find it, we can instantly 어u.

461
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,180
Yes.

462
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:36,440
The

463
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,960
Sir, this is...

464
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I can't find the spiritual spring.

465
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Wei Qiu.

466
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
He's using his anger to find the spiritual spring.

467
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Is that Master?

468
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Or...

469
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I miss him too much.

470
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
I had a hallucination before.

471
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
There was a earthquake in the valley.

472
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Are you okay?

473
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm fine.

474
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,560
Master,

475
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
did he go out of the coffin today?

476
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
It's still early.

477
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
You should focus on your cultivation.

478
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,760
Don't worry about the others.

479
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
I'll go with you.

480
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I'll go with you.

481
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I'll go with you.

482
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I'll go with you.

483
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Keep practicing.

484
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Ling Xiao.

485
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,960
Did you see clearly just now?

486
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,360
Is that Master?

487
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Is that Master?

488
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Ling Xiao.

489
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Ling Xiao.

490
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
It's so cold!

491
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Oh no!

492
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Go tell Master

493
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
that Ling Quan is moving so fast.

494
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
It seems that he's going to break the seal.

495
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
All the sects need to cooperate.

496
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Find the spiritual spring as soon as possible.

497
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Mu Qingge said that

498
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
he didn't know where the spiritual spring was.

499
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
But he turned around and hurt the real person.

500
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
It's not a pity for him.

501
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Hong Shan,

502
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
go keep an eye on Mu Qingge.

503
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Yes.

504
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
You and I are clearly the same person.

505
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
What trick do you have on me?

506
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
I can kill you.

507
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
One skill.

508
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Mu Qingge!

509
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Ling Xiao.

510
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Did I just enter your memory?

511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Your memory is your soul master's memory.

512
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Then,

513
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
is there my past self in this?

514
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
The female immortal who was surrounded by Wei Jiu

515
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
is my past self?

516
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
The young man who appeared just now

517
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
is your soul master?

518
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
You want to kill me?

519
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
No.

520
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Your soul master wants to kill my past self.

521
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Why?

522
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Wei Jiu, that demon,

523
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
said that I was the same person as him.

524
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Could it be that my past self is also a bad person?

525
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Could it be that Master didn't tell me

526
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
because of this?

527
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Ling Xiao,

528
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
can't you remember

529
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
some other memories?

530
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Master said that

531
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
this immortal tree is connected to my spiritual spring.

532
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I can't remember anything else.

533
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,960
This tree is connected to my spiritual spring.

534
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
My spiritual roots are growing.

535
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Ling Xiao,

536
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
my spiritual power nourished you.

537
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
That's why you can share these memories with me.

538
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Right?

539
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
As long as I keep practicing,

540
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I will remember something else.

541
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Ling Xiao,

542
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I'm here.

543
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm here.

544
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,960
It's still cold here.

545
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Ling Xiao's soul master,

546
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
we meet again.

547
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I've been thinking about it.

548
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
There must be some misunderstanding between us.

549
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Although

550
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
you wanted to kill me just now,

551
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
but it's also possible that you did it to protect me.

552
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
I feel that we've been entangled for a long time.

553
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,960
What is our relationship?

554
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Maybe we'll know it in the future.

555
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I came here this time

556
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
to tell you something new.

557
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
In the past year and a half of cultivation,

558
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I not only increased my cultivation,

559
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
but also

560
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,960
I also understood my heart better.

561
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I just like my master.

562
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,960
What I did when I was poisoned by peach blossom wine

563
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,960
was what I really thought in my heart.

564
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
The fairy tree can lie to people,

565
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
but the feeling at that time can't lie to people.

566
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
At that time,

567
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
when I was close to him,

568
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I would fall in love with him.

569
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Later,

570
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
I couldn't see him.

571
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
I would miss him.

572
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Even if I thought he was the one in the valley,

573
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I would be happy.

574
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
If this doesn't count as liking,

575
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
how can I call it liking?

576
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I can understand the book that my master gave me.

577
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
But I think the people in the book

578
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
are too entangled.

579
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
They didn't talk much,

580
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
and there were many misunderstandings.

581
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
In the end, they became lovers.

582
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Even if the master's idea is to make a thunderbolt,

583
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
I'll just give it a try.

584
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Tomorrow is the day I go out.

585
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,960
There will be a rain cloud in Xishan.

586
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
I heard that under this weather,

587
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
I will be able to make a wish and confess.

588
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
I plan to ask my master to come with me.

589
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
I'm scared.

590
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I don't know how long you've been trapped.

591
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
You never talk.

592
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
I don't know if you're punished by others

593
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
or you're trapped.

594
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
You also feel very cold.

595
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
You're just like my master.

596
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
You're lonely.

597
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
You never tell others your feelings.

598
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Then,

599
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
will you be missing someone

600
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
when you're trapped here?

601
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
The third period of training has been completed.

602
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Congratulations to you.

603
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You can leave the temple now.

604
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Will my master

605
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,960
come to see the rain cloud with me?

606
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
The rain cloud?

607
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Rain cloud,

608
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
please listen to my wish.

609
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I hope that I can...

610
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Where did the wind come from?

611
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
I'm afraid that

612
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
the wind is too strong.

613
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm afraid that

614
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
the wind is too strong.

615
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I'm afraid that

616
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
the wind is too strong.

617
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I hope that

618
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
the wind is too strong.

619
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I hope that

620
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
my master...

621
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Who's that?

622
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Master!

623
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,360
I missed you so much.

624
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,200
I missed you so much.

625
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,040
I have something to tell you.

626
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,880
I...

627
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,080
You're about to be married.

628
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,480
You must choose your own path.

629
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,960
I want to hear your choice.

630
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
I've been practicing Tao since I was a child.

631
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm very familiar with Tao.

632
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,080
The most difficult thing in the world

633
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
is to practice.

634
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Since you've made up your mind to enter Tao,

635
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
you must be able to practice.

636
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,240
You must not be careless.

637
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Whether it's a path of love or not,

638
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,960
once you make a choice,

639
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
you must stick to it.

640
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
If you're not able to practice,

641
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
your Tao skills will be unstable.

642
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
For you,

643
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
this is the most important thing.

644
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I'm really not lucky.

645
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I just got lost for no reason.

646
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
It was so hard to see my master.

647
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I couldn't say what I wanted to say.

648
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I was even hurt by a bite.

649
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Is that Xiaoyu?

650
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
She's here.

651
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
What is the Crown Prince busy with lately?

652
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Why is he coming to my place less and less?

653
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

654
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Speak.

655
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Your Highness,

656
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
there's a gentleman called Wang Hongshan

657
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
who wants to see you.

658
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Why is he here?

659
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Leave.

660
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Yes.

661
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Master Wen rejected my proposal

662
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
right after he saw me.

663
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
What?

664
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Are you regretting it now?

665
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
I shouldn't have been so aggressive

666
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
and hurt Master Wen's face.

667
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
I'm willing to lose my spiritual power

668
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
to fix your scar on your face.

669
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I didn't expect you to come to the capital

670
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
for such a small matter.

671
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Tell me.

672
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
How do you want me to make up for you?

673
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Lose my spiritual power?

674
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Or use these spiritual treasures to make up for me?

675
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Stop pretending.

676
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
You're not Brother Mu Qing.

677
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Why are you talking nonsense?

678
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
You mentioned about

679
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
how Brother Mu Qing hurt me in the mountain.

680
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
But

681
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
I didn't do that

682
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
because of him.

683
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I wanted to bring back Yishui to Xishan.

684
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
In order to make Yishui change his mind,

685
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I claimed that he destroyed my face on purpose.

686
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
If you're really Brother Mu Qing,

687
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
you wouldn't not know the hidden meaning of it.

688
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Am I right?

689
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Mu Ranwu.

690
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Where is he?

691
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Why did you pretend to be him?

692
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Nonsense.

693
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm Brother Mu Qing.

694
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Even Suo Yishui admitted that I'm Brother Mu Qing.

695
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
You can break the

696
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,860
Yishui's

697
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,960
Facing Fragment Curse.

698
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
It really surprised me.

699
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
But

700
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
the fake can't be real.

701
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
You and I know each other.

702
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
What do you want?

703
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
I want to see the real Brother Mu Qing.

704
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Where is he?

705
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
I don't know.

706
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Another Gu Yan.

707
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Another Gu Yan

708
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
was cut off by a tree

709
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
19 years ago.

710
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Do you think

711
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
he's still alive?

712
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
He's dead?

713
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
If he died so easily,

714
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
he wouldn't be Brother Mu Qing.

715
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Only the real Brother Mu Qing

716
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
knows where Lin Quan is.

717
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You're his sister and his brother.

718
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
You should be easier to find than others.

719
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
As long as you tell me his whereabouts,

720
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I won't interfere with your business.

721
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Otherwise,

722
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I'll tell the world

723
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
your real identity.

724
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Where are you?

725
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll find you.

726
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Because

727
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
you must die.

728
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
You're quite well-behaved today.

729
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
It's only been a year and a half.

730
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Ranran has practiced three times.

731
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Of course,

732
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
there's also your

733
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
teacher's teaching.

734
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
It's too slow.

735
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Let the spirit energy

736
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
stay in Muranwu for a year.

737
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Before he finds out,

738
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
we need to let Ranran attack

739
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
to keep his spirit energy.

740
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
If you want him to attack quickly,

741
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
why not try the old practice of the cultivation world?

742
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Let him practice and make a contribution.

743
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
That's good.

744
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Practice makes perfect.

745
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Yin Tong's reaction is like this.

746
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Did you feel the spirit energy

747
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
from the ambush you set up?

748
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
The situation of the compass

749
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
seems to be in the northwest direction.

750
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Pass on the imperial edict.

751
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
It's raining now.

752
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
The earthquake is frequent.

753
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
The flood has reached the canal.

754
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,960
There are floodplains around the capital.

755
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
There are many landslides

756
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
and sand-colored disasters.

757
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
The money spent by the court

758
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
is not enough to cover the flood.

759
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,960
The capital of the capital has exceeded 100,000 yuan.

760
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
The flood is still severe.

761
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
This is the fault of the crown prince

762
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
who is not responsible for the country.

763
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
The crown prince is ordered to go

764
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
to patrol the states immediately.

765
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
He is supervised by the canal management

766
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
to pacify the disaster.

767
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
He will make up for the fault.

768
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
That's all.

769
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I obey the edict.

770
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Eunuch Wu,

771
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,960
the ceremony of the day is at the end of this month.

772
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,960
If you go to manage the canal at this time,

773
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
you will never be able to come back.

774
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

775
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
The ceremony of the day

776
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
has been handed over to the third prince.

777
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Why did father change his mind suddenly?

778
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Your Highness,

779
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
His Majesty is healthy and well.

780
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
The third prince is busy every day

781
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
and prays for His Majesty.

782
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
But the Crown Prince's Mansion

783
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,800
is full of treasures and

784
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,960
is busy with the ceremony.

785
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Not only that,

786
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Her Highness has promised His Majesty

787
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
to take care of the plain.

788
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
It's been a year.

789
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
There is no sign of him.

790
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,960
His Majesty is angry now.

791
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,960
He sent the crown prince to manage the canal.

792
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I'll leave first.

793
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Your Highness,

794
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
please go inside.

795
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I'll explain it to you.

796
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
There might be a chance.

797
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
No need.

798
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Your Highness is smart.

799
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Everything is under your control.

800
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
The canal is under your control?

801
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Su Yishui!

802
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Su Yishui!

803
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Su Yishui!

804
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Su Yishui!

805
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Su Yishui!

806
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Su Yishui!

807
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Su Yishui!

808
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Su Yishui!

809
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm looking for Su Yishui!

810
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Su...

811
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Who are you?

812
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Why are you looking for me?

813
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm Qin Xuanjiu.

814
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Master asked me to look for Su Yishui.

815
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Call him out.

816
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Who is your master?

817
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
My master is the most powerful

818
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Mu Qingge.

819
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
What?

820
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
You're the apprentice

821
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
that Master told me about on the battlefield.

822
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Master told me about you.

823
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
I've never seen a real person.

824
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
But it's different from

825
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
the taste that Master gives me.

826
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Master said that he would take me

827
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
to see him after the battle.

828
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
But on the way,

829
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
he was killed by an animal

830
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
who was about to kill him.

831
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Who told you to come to Xishan?

832
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Master said

833
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
if Luo Pan was moving,

834
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
he would ask me to look for you.

835
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Luo Pan didn't move.

836
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I don't know why,

837
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
but he was broken.

838
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Did he do it?

839
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Is there anything else

840
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
other than Luo Pan's damage?

841
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Recently,

842
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
there were a few brothers in the camp

843
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
who disappeared without a trace.

844
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
When we found them,

845
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
it was very strange.

846
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
But it's about my camp.

847
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Don't worry about this.

848
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
It's weird.

849
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Why is the demon aura

850
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
on Luo Pan?

851
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Nonsense.

852
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
How could I have demon power?

853
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
If you don't believe me,

854
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
you can ask Master.

855
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
See if it's a demon aura.

856
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I thought about it.

857
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
But I don't know why

858
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Master suddenly didn't recognize me.

859
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
I can't enter the door.

860
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
According to the law,

861
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
I'm a soldier on the side of the tree.

862
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
I can't enter the capital at will.

863
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,960
That's why I have to come to Xishan to find someone.

864
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Since Master asked you to look for Luo Pan,

865
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
why don't you listen to his idea?

866
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Then what should I do?

867
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
I'll go to the door.

868
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Okay, I'll go.

869
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
The demon aura has been cut off,

870
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
it can't be restored.

871
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Luo Pan is an important secret

872
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
entrusted by Master.

873
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
The reason it was broken

874
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
is also important.

875
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Don't ignore it.

876
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
The only clue

877
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
is the demon aura.

878
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
There's something strange happening in the capital.

879
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
I think the death of the soldiers

880
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
is also related to the truth of Luo Pan.

881
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
I have to go to the camp.

882
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Master, Ran Ran is looking for you.

883
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
It's too late, let's go now.

884
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Do you need to go now?

885
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I haven't eaten yet.

886
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
At least let me eat.

887
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
I'll pay for the food.

888
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
The new worship is on the way.

889
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
You arrange the training

890
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
for the mountain.

891
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
Okay, I'll inform them now.

892
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
Four people together

893
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
need to take care of each other.

894
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Master went to the mountain to move the body.

895
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Has he left?

896
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Didn't he just come to class?

897
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
I made some delicious food.

898
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I'm sorry.

899
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I'm sorry.

900
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm sorry.

901
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
I'm sorry.

905
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
I'm sorry.

911
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm sorry.

912
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
I'm sorry.

913
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm sorry.

916
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
