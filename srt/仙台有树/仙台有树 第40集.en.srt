[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,000
[Episode 40]

3
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,640
I am the tower,

4
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,570
and the tower is me.

5
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,280
As long as the Three Thousand Realms don't rise,

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,479
I will be immortal and indestructible.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,350
What do you have to defeat me?

8
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,430
Using your own mortal body

9
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,310
to become such a heaven-defying evil being.

10
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,100
Even if you enter the Three Thousand Realms,

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,590
your cultivation will be completely destroyed,

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,030
and you'll become a mortal!

13
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,590
But with my talent,

14
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,810
even if I have to start cultivating all over again,

15
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,020
it won't take me long.

16
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,380
If you don't comply with my wishes,

17
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,910
I'll destroy another realm

18
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,020
and rebuild the Three Thousand Realms Tower.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,230
Dun Tian has gone mad.

20
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,270
We only have one option left now.

21
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,710
Yu?

22
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,310
He has been fighting with me for years.

23
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,170
I know him well.

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,630
In Su Yu's heart,

25
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,079
there must still be attachment.

26
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,079
He definitely won't bear to see this realm destroyed.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,010
Su Yu!

28
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,610
Wake up!

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,030
Su Yu is more than willing

30
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,200
to come with me to the Three Thousand Realms.

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,990
Su Yishui.

32
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,760
Save your breath.

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,080
Su Yu!

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,310
If you can't protect the universe,

35
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,970
hand your position over to me.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,210
Don't be a loser!

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,079
Wake up!

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,240
Yu, leave the altar!

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,910
Don't let this realm be destroyed.

40
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
Don't let Dun Tian get what he wants!

41
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,750
Ranran?

42
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,630
Su Yishui?

43
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,240
Su Yu!

44
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,280
You and I have been fighting for so many years.

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,870
If you still have

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,360
any dignity as the Crown Prince in your heart,

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
step out of the altar!

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,450
If you can't protect the universe, just admit it.

49
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,079
Don't flee to

50
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,890
the Three Thousand Realms like a deserter!

51
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,210
Stop daydreaming!

52
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,040
How could the two of you

53
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,630
possibly make him waver?

54
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,680
Su Yishui.

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,520
You, a defeated opponent of mine,

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,000
sure love to boast.

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
The universe is mine.

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,150
If anyone's going to protect it,

59
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,280
it'll be me.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,740
Devil-breaking Cone?

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
When I deliberately

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
let you bring me here,

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,620
I'd already had everything planned.

64
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,800
Why?

65
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,510
Our plan

66
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,710
was about to succeed!

67
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,070
Why are you doing this?

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,510
Don't you want to live a life

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,120
where all your wishes come true?

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,750
I do!

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,270
But...

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,760
I can't picture what it looks like.

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,780
It's great to have all your wishes come true,

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
but not once,

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,630
not even once,

76
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,890
have I been able to truly imagine

77
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,550
what that scene would be like!

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,490
Maybe Feihua was right.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,190
A world like that

80
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,740
ultimately doesn't belong to me.

81
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
You really let me down.

82
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,000
Right?

83
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm surprised too.

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,630
Setbacks

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
are unavoidable in life.

86
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,930
But each one of these setbacks

87
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,430
is unique.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,490
Some people hate me,

89
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,150
while others love me.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,000
Some reject me,

91
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,500
while others cherish me.

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,409
These experiences alternate,

93
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,360
filling my memories.

94
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,070
But looking back now,

95
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,390
every single one

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,159
is deeply etched in my heart.

97
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,830
Dun Tian!

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,190
I know you won't let me go!

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
And neither will I

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,430
forgive myself.

101
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,470
Ranran.

102
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,720
Ranran!

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,830
Tell Feihua that

104
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm grateful to her for waking me up.

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,510
In this life,

106
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,210
I've actually lived

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,159
quite well.

108
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,190
Yu!

109
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,510
It's okay.

110
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,480
Even though both of you are dead,

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
it's okay.

112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,830
You'll become

113
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,630
nourishment for the Three Thousand Realms Tower!

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,010
There's still time.

115
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
Even though they died, there's still time.

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,950
The Three Thousand Realms Tower is about to mature.

117
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,550
Everything is still in time!

118
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,800
Shui, look.

119
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,800
Someone with a death wish is having second thoughts.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
The power Dun Tian is using

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,510
to absorb the Three Thousand Realms Tower

122
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,430
has a flaw.

123
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,430
This is the chance

124
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,430
Yu left for us.

125
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I'll hold him off.

126
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,870
You go to the top of the tower.

127
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,630
This tower is almost complete.

128
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,950
Dun Tian's been absorbing the power of all realms.

129
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,830
It will only make him stronger.

130
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,230
You...

131
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't worry.

132
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,380
I'll do everything to stop him,

133
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,710
and I'll fight even harder to stay alive and be with you.

134
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,870
Go!

135
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,510
You've opened the sea of Qi

136
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,000
and penetrated the immortal power.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,750
It seems you also know that

138
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,870
this is the last moment

139
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,750
of your life.

140
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
You're really going all out.

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
A battle to the death.

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,320
As it should be.

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
A diversion?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,260
You're seeking death!

145
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,240
Impressive.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,630
You actually managed to use your mortal body

147
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,390
to forcefully pass through

148
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,990
the spatial gate I tore open.

149
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,630
I told you,

150
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,460
a battle to the death should be like this.

151
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,430
Quickly, to the top of the tower.

152
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,670
I'll kill you both at once!

153
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,930
Sword of Non-Attachment!

154
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,060
You've been with me for so many years.

155
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,720
Today, our souls and lives intertwine.

156
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,050
We swear to protect Ranran with our lives.

157
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,200
Shui!

158
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,750
Just focus on destroying the tower!

159
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,270
How are you?

160
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,510
Dun Tian!

161
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,670
It's over!

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,030
I won't lose.

163
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,790
Everything I've lost

164
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,840
will come back!

165
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,180
Foul and evil spirits of the Three Thousand Realms!

166
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,750
I offer everything in this realm as sacrifice!

167
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,350
I offer myself as sacrifice!

168
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,870
Come on!

169
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,360
Feast on my flesh and blood!

170
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,710
Help me open the Three Thousand Realms!

171
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,670
You defied heaven!

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,810
Your crimes are unforgivable!

173
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
Dragon Goddess.

174
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,480
Immortals.

175
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,410
You've actually descended to the mortal world!

176
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,480
You sealed off the passage from the Dragon Island

177
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,830
to the Immortal Realm.

178
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,510
Fortunately, Xue Ranran and Su Yishui

179
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,480
destroyed the Three Thousand Realms Tower,

180
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,140
allowing us to arrive in time.

181
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,200
Dun Tian.

182
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,750
Your ambition ends here.

183
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,080
The Three Thousand Realms.

184
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,420
My Three Thousand Realms.

185
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,320
My Three Thousand Realms...

186
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,920
My Three Thousand Realms...

187
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,270
The Three Thousand Realms are an illusion.

188
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,480
Your remorse for your wife and children

189
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,170
is even more illusory.

190
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,360
My family should have reunited.

191
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,650
It's all because of you.

192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,510
It's all your fault!

193
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,720
The affection that belonged to you

194
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,120
and the bond you had with them

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,780
had already ended and severed

196
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,920
when you watched them die before your eyes.

197
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,110
You're too selfish.

198
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,510
You abandoned them first,

199
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,670
yet for the sake of

200
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,130
your own pathetic regret,

201
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,960
you dragged an entire realm to perish with you.

202
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
For someone like you,

203
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,150
even if your wife and children were to be resurrected,

204
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,680
they would see you as a devil

205
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,610
and avoid you at all costs.

206
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,470
I... I...

207
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,080
Mom, you made chicken drumsticks.

208
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,140
They smell so good.

209
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,450
Darling, dinner's ready.

210
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,600
Rong Yao.

211
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,930
Dad, hurry up,

212
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,890
or I'll finish all the drumsticks.

213
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,750
Yu'er.

214
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,270
Dad.

215
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,790
She's really eating them.

216
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,320
She won't leave any for you.

217
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,240
Wan'er.

218
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,480
♫In March, we make rice milk♫

219
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,630
♫And bring it to our daughter for a taste♫

220
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,360
♫In April, we make wine♫

221
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,080
Rong Yao!

222
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,480
♫If you miss it for a day♫

223
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,930
♫You'll feel restless♫

224
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,670
Thanks to your timely arrival, Dragon Goddess.

225
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,480
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

226
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
If it weren't for you,

227
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,360
I and those guys from the Immortal Realm

228
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,020
would have been helpless too.

229
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Qing Luo is seriously injured.

230
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
It'll take some time for her to recover.

231
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
The Dragon Clan has a long lifespan.

232
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,520
Even with severe injuries,

233
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,250
a hundred years of recuperation should suffice.

234
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,080
What I'm more worried about is you.

235
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,280
Not to mention your physical injuries,

236
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,670
the entire land

237
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,710
has been completely destroyed.

238
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,070
What do you plan to do?

239
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,480
Although the human clan has short lifespans,

240
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,280
we're endlessly regenerating.

241
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,190
That's right.

242
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,360
Together,

243
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,000
we can surely bring everything back to life.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
Good kids.

245
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,510
I can't stay long.

246
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,160
I need to take Qing Luo and leave first.

247
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,329
If you have time,

248
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,310
come visit Dragon Island again.

249
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,710
You're welcome anytime.

250
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,960
Let's go.

251
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,070
Master!

252
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,280
Master. Ranran.

253
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,830
Stiffly Su.

254
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,400
Ranran.

255
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,680
You're safe and sound.

256
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,480
That's great.

257
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,070
Xi'er.

258
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,720
We should be happy

259
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,440
that Master and Ranran are both okay.

260
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,200
Stop crying.

261
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,200
Indeed.

262
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,830
They've also protected this part of the world.

263
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,760
It's a great joy.

264
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,790
Good.

265
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,680
It's good that you're both safe.

266
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,810
It's good that everything's okay now.

267
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,310
You risked your lives without hesitation

268
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,160
and saved all living beings

269
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,420
in the midst of danger.

270
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,310
You've indeed set a good example for all Heavenly Sects.

271
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,920
Indeed.

272
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,200
Please accept our bow.

273
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,210
We are the same.

274
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,070
There's no need for such formalities.

275
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,000
We saved the world,

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,420
but it was also to save ourselves.

277
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,400
Moreover, it was only because you all fought outside the mountain

278
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,480
and risked your lives to protect it

279
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,510
that this land didn't

280
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,240
become a wasteland.

281
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,790
This matter is settled,

282
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,000
but there's more to be done in the future.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,830
Let's help the people rebuild their homes first.

284
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,830
That's the priority for now.

285
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,880
That's right.

286
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,720
We've all expressed our thanks.

287
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,680
Everyone, disperse

288
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,210
and get some real work done.

289
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,150
Sovereign Wei, you were severely injured.

290
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,480
Are you able to walk now?

291
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,190
Even if I can't, I have to.

292
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,470
My bones were already broken,

293
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,330
and I was thrown out of that space.

294
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,140
So unlucky.

295
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,830
I protected his vital meridians.

296
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,090
Even severe injuries won't be a problem.

297
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
You make it sound so easy.

298
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,550
I'm in a lot of pain.

299
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,520
Forget it.

300
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,450
I won't argue with you.

301
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,680
They say the Celestial Sect is a Demonic Sect,

302
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,550
but Sovereign Wei and Elder Tu,

303
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,550
you showed great righteousness in the face of adversity.

304
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,830
Even we of the Heavenly Sects

305
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,960
are not comparable.

306
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,000
From today on,

307
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,110
immortal cultivators

308
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,050
will no longer be divided into Heavenly and Demonic Sects.

309
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,750
As long as one does righteous deeds,

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,480
the universe is one big family.

311
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,550
Who's family with you?

312
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,960
We're still the top Demonic Sect.

313
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,290
I'm still the big devil.

314
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,920
You...

315
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,750
If you see me in the future

316
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,030
and dare to come greet me or pay respects,

317
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,110
I'll beat you up.

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,680
Ranran.

319
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,640
Yishui.

320
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,550
Do you have any plans?

321
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,110
Plans?

322
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,030
Now that Mount Wester has been destroyed,

323
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,230
it's uninhabitable.

324
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,270
If you don't mind,

325
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,950
you can come to Mount Hollow with us.

326
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,880
Although its spiritual channel is damaged,

327
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
it's still an immortal mountain after all.

328
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,960
The Eternal Sect is also willing to accept everyone from the Wester Sect.

329
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
All the Heavenly Sects of the universe

330
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
are open for you to choose.

331
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,860
Ranran.

332
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,440
Come to Mount Cuiwei.

333
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,530
This way,

334
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,310
we can brew good wine together,

335
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,880
right?

336
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,920
Exactly.

337
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,510
Drinking from dawn to dusk every day,

338
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,070
wouldn't that be delightful?

339
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,730
Thank you for your kind offer,

340
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,150
but Mount Wester is fine.

341
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,980
What Shui means is that

342
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,370
Mount Wester will always be our home.

343
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,350
It won't be long

344
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
before Mount Wester returns to its original state.

345
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
When that time comes,

346
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,200
we'd like to invite you all to come and drink.

347
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,930
Sounds good.

348
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,030
Making me come all this way,

349
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,000
carrying two jars of Mistaken Divine up Mount Absolute,

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,460
not even knowing what for.

351
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
And he's not even here.

352
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,640
Shui.

353
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,070
Su Yishui!

354
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,840
Today is the Qixi Festival.

355
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,830
I asked you to come up Mount Absolute

356
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,960
to see the lanterns.

357
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
Everyone else goes to the riverside to release lanterns,

358
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,700
but you insist on coming to the mountaintop.

359
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,400
Why should my lanterns

360
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,130
be the same as everyone else's?

361
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,880
This Reincarnation Tree

362
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,160
means a lot to me.

363
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
This is where I want to be.

364
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,550
Alright, alright.

365
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,200
We've seen the lanterns. Let's start drinking.

366
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Why rush to drink?

367
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,960
We've got work to do.

368
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,310
The lanterns have all been lit.

369
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,640
What else is there to do?

370
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,240
On the Qixi Festival, when releasing lanterns,

371
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,750
you're supposed to write love messages.

372
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,950
Have you written any?

373
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,830
Fine.

374
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,000
Give me one.

375
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,010
I'll write some for you.

376
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,720
One?

377
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,400
I bought dozens of lanterns.

378
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,740
You want me to write on all of them?

379
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,680
I'm not a chatterbox.

380
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,150
How can I come up with so many love messages?

381
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,110
We have a long future

382
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,160
ahead of us.

383
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,130
Can't you write even a few dozen love messages?

384
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,730
If you can't write them well,

385
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,680
don't even think about drinking.

386
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,880
I'll watch you write.

387
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,180
You need supervision.

388
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,880
Why do I need supervision?

389
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,210
So many young Heavenly disciples

390
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
have been captivated by you.

391
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,150
Of course you need supervision.

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,640
Sovereign Su, you're no less popular.

393
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,590
Over the past three years,

394
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,070
countless female Immortal Masters

395
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,070
have been sending gifts to Mount Wester like flowing water.

396
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
So, Sovereign Su,

397
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
I shouldn't be the only one writing love messages.

398
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,640
You should write with me.

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,730
Moreover...

400
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,730
Sword of Non-Attachment?

401
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,830
Alcohol Immortal and Liang Wumeng

402
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,020
searched everywhere for craftsmen,

403
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,640
and it took them three years to repair it.

404
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,700
If you don't write,

405
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,660
I won't let you have it.

406
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,010
Alright.

407
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
But forget about the love messages.

408
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,530
I have something I'd rather do than write love messages.

409
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,430
♫Ripples shimmer among the flowers♫

410
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,220
♫The wind plucks the clouds in the sky♫

411
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,540
♫Because of you, my fleeting life is filled with endless thoughts♫

412
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,430
♫Since my lips touched your beauty♫

413
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,040
♫I envy nothing in this world♫

414
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,820
♫Even butterflies and swallows gift us their graceful dance♫

415
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,500
♫If the full moon is destined to wane♫

416
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,510
♫If time is bound to change everything♫

417
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,920
♫Then I wish to follow you like a migrating bird♫

418
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,420
♫Never tired of gazing at you, longing for you day and night♫

419
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,420
♫I wish to be with you forever♫

420
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,750
Eat more.

421
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,050
♫Braving every trial and tribulation♫

422
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,480
Master, Ranran.

423
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,550
Bad news.

424
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,720
Just now, Sovereign Wei, Wei Jiu,

425
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,310
broke into Mount Wester.

426
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,770
He went to Consonance Palace to see Elder Tu.

427
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,880
You let her hide from Wei Jiu in the Consonance Palace,

428
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,080
but she'll have to face him eventually.

429
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,070
Three years ago, she had nowhere to go.

430
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,670
We had to help her, didn't we?

431
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,070
Oh no.

432
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,720
What?

433
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,030
In front of Consonance Palace,

434
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,720
there's the new sword formation we just set up.

435
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,350
Wei Jiu doesn't have Mount Wester's token.

436
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,310
If he barges in recklessly,

437
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,170
the sword formation will definitely be activated.

438
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,590
Guardian.

439
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,190
Guardian.

440
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Senior!

441
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
I beg you to see me!

442
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,600
I'm here.

443
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,270
What do you want to say?

444
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,800
Go ahead.

445
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,240
Senior.

446
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,090
I was wrong.

447
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I was very wrong.

448
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,920
I came just to tell you that

449
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,970
I truly regret my actions.

450
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,040
I've raised many butterflies.

451
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
In the valley to the west

452
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,590
of Mount Scarlet Flame,

453
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,050
I've raised many butterflies for you.

454
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,270
Now,

455
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,470
that place is called Butterfly Valley.

456
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,420
You don't have to avoid the Celestial Sect because of me.

457
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,210
I'm leaving.

458
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,010
If you ever return to Mount Scarlet Flame,

459
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,160
please go and see it.

460
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,490
My wish has been fulfilled.

461
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,640
Let's

462
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,720
part ways here.

463
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,400
Are you abandoning our sect?

464
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,530
Where are you going?

465
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
To seclude myself and reflect on my mistakes.

466
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,890
You can't leave.

467
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,400
The old sovereign entrusted everything to you,

468
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,330
yet you're hiding away to reflect?

469
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,160
You're just slacking off, aren't you?

470
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,660
If you truly want to reflect,

471
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,820
make amends for your past mistakes

472
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,680
and revitalize the Demonic Sect.

473
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,910
It's not that I don't want to.

474
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,050
It's just that in the past,

475
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
you were always there, fighting by my side.

476
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,070
But now,

477
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,400
I've lost the person

478
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,530
I relied on the most.

479
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,010
I'm too ashamed to revitalize the Demonic Sect.

480
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,790
Fine.

481
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,000
One year.

482
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,210
I'll help you for one year.

483
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,750
If during this year,

484
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,540
your actions

485
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,780
live up to the old sovereign's trust,

486
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
I'll extend it for another year.

487
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
Until I'm sure

488
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,810
you've completely reformed.

489
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,270
Really?

490
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,310
Don't think this means I've forgiven you.

491
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,240
I just don't want

492
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,010
to let the old sovereign down. That's all.

493
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,440
Okay.

494
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Okay.

495
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,240
Okay.

496
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,890
I'll take you...

497
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,000
No,

498
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
I'll welcome you back right now.

499
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,750
You're always like this,

500
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,060
covered in wounds.

501
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,480
I wonder if

502
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,720
you're doing this on purpose, trying to soften my heart.

503
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,550
I wouldn't dare.

504
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:43,960
I...

505
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,160
I wouldn't dare.

506
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,130
Bai Baishan.

507
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,790
From today onwards,

508
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,240
the position of Wester Sect's sovereign

509
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,640
will be entrusted to you.

510
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,550
Master.

511
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,890
Have I done something wrong again?

512
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,550
You've done well these years.

513
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,960
What wrongdoing are you talking about?

514
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,690
Please rise.

515
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,220
It's just that I no longer want

516
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,720
to be the sovereign of Wester Sect.

517
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,030
You are the senior disciple of Wester Sect,

518
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,960
so of course you should succeed me.

519
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,510
Master.

520
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,920
I've

521
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
made a grave mistake in the past.

522
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,060
Senior Bai.

523
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,040
Who doesn't make mistakes?

524
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,000
You've been working day and night, tirelessly rebuilding Mount Wester

525
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,400
for the past three years.

526
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
Everyone admires you for it.

527
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,160
The position of sovereign is rightfully yours.

528
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,220
It's only fitting.

529
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,830
Stop making excuses.

530
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,000
Do you want to break

531
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,530
the lineage of Wester Sect?

532
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,090
Accept the token.

533
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,810
[Wester Sect]

534
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,740
I'll definitely make Wester Sect

535
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,810
prosper and flourish.

536
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,350
Our Wester Sect

537
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,920
doesn't have to be too prosperous.

538
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,180
Just let it be as it may.

539
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,210
I'll do my best.

540
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,030
Here's the guest list

541
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,330
[Guest List] [Gift List]

542
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,920
and gift list for the wedding banquet.

543
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,750
Wedding banquet?

544
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,790
Gift list?

545
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,690
We promised each other three years ago

546
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,760
to get married after Mount Wester was rebuilt.

547
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,680
Now it's time.

548
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,180
My wedding with Ranran

549
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,760
will be held at Mount Wester.

550
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
No wonder

551
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,400
so many boxes were brought in today.

552
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,160
It turns out they were part of the wedding preparations.

553
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,090
It's a great joy.

554
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,710
It's truly a tremendous joy.

555
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,920
Since this is the first major task

556
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,150
after I took over as sovereign,

557
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,350
Master, Ranran,

558
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,330
why not let me take charge

559
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,340
of the wedding arrangements?

560
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,410
Senior Bai.

561
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,240
The wedding is really too complicated.

562
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,920
It made my head spin just hearing about it.

563
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
My lifelong commitment with Master

564
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,730
is entirely in your hands now.

565
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,960
Everyone, be quick with your hands.

566
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,870
Work faster.

567
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,270
Be careful, don't drop anything.

568
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,530
Don't worry, Mr. Zeng.

569
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,200
What,

570
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,030
our sovereign of Wester Sect

571
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,030
can't even handle this little task?

572
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,450
Mr. Zeng.

573
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,460
Please don't tease me

574
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,740
on such a joyous day.

575
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,310
This is our actual wedding day.

576
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,960
We haven't even completed the ceremony yet.

577
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,290
Why did you come in here?

578
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,840
I've come to bring you your wedding dress.

579
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
I found a skilled craftsman,

580
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,070
and it took him three years to complete the alterations.

581
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,880
I just want you to wear

582
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,200
the most beautiful wedding dress when you marry me.

583
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
You've planned it all out, haven't you?

584
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,210
For you,

585
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,080
I must

586
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,710
plan everything carefully.

587
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,720
We're getting married tonight.

588
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,960
Are you prepared?

589
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:33,880
How...

590
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,470
How should I prepare?

591
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,410
They say you were a demoness in your past life,

592
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,440
but now it seems

593
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,270
to be illusory.

594
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,760
Surely I'm not worthy of that name.

595
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,290
What, Sovereign Su,

596
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,940
does that mean you're very experienced?

597
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Well, not really.

598
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,640
But for the past twenty-some years,

599
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,770
a woman has appeared in my dreams a lot.

600
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,030
She'd call me Shui

601
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,940
while seducing me.

602
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,790
Perhaps I've had so many dreams

603
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,520
that I've learned it by myself.

604
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,740
I've never heard of

605
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,940
someone learning this in their dreams.

606
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
Could the one who entered your dream

607
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,750
be a fox demon?

608
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,270
Then tonight,

609
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,600
I'll carefully examine

610
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,810
how many fox tails she has.

611
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,560
You...

612
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,310
Leave already.

613
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,120
Don't disturb me while I'm getting ready.

614
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,480
The ceremony of entering the hall begins.

615
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,960
The bride, please enter.

You call that a blessing?

I wish you two

Alright, let's drink together.

685
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,920
Sit, sit.

686
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,530
Come on.

687
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,070
Eat more.

688
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:55,910
What's wrong?

689
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,760
Are you tired?

690
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,480
I'll drink them under the table right away,

691
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,110
then we'll go to the bridal chamber.

692
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,840
But your alcohol tolerance...

693
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,940
I traded three jars of Mistaken Divine

694
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,400
with the Alcohol Immortal

695
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,230
for this Heavy Weight.

696
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,960
Master, Ranran.

697
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,470
A toast to you.

698
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,110
What kind of wine did you drink?

699
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,080
This taste...

700
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,380
Of course it's the wine that will be useful for tonight.

701
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,800
You...

702
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,440
My dear.

703
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,340
It's getting late.

704
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,800
We should rest early.

705
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,430
[Carefree Pavilion]

706
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,880
Ranran.

707
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,320
Master.

708
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,710
It's been three days already.

709
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,450
Why haven't

710
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,210
Ranran and Master come out yet?

711
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,110
Ranran.

712
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,070
Master.

713
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,370
Master.

714
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,070
Ranran?

715
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,440
Our wishes have been fulfilled,

716
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,750
and we have no more desires.

717
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,210
We've left to travel the universe together.

718
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,020
Everything here is now entrusted to you.

719
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,710
If fate allows, we shall meet again.

720
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,880
Mr. Zeng.

721
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,680
What should we do now?

722
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,630
What do you mean, "what should we do"?

723
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,480
You're now the sovereign of Wester Sect.

724
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,550
The daily affairs of the sect

725
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,960
are now under your jurisdiction.

726
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,840
Without those two,

727
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,480
the world goes on, doesn't it?

728
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,030
Well...

729
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,710
When will they return?

730
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,960
Perhaps

731
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,450
when they're tired,

732
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,570
or when they're homesick,

733
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,510
or maybe

734
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,330
when they have a child.

735
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,760
Who knows?

736
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,020
[13 years later]

737
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,030
[Wester Sect]

738
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,670
Mr. Zeng. Mr. Qin.

739
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,070
The new disciples who joined Wester Sect this year

740
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,200
are quite numerous.

741
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,630
Are you really not going to help me teach them?

742
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,760
I don't know any immortal techniques.

743
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,450
Look at my beard.

744
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,200
It has grown longer, right?

745
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,110
If anyone's going to teach them,

746
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,630
it should be Mr. Zeng.

747
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,550
Both the previous sovereign of Wester Sect and the one before him

748
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,550
have left to travel in the universe.

749
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,590
You want me to take over this thankless task?

750
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,230
Moreover,

751
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,580
you, the new sovereign,

752
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,380
are managing Wester Sect

753
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,240
in an orderly manner, aren't you?

754
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,030
As for us,

755
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,710
we'll just drink tea

756
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,150
and tend to flowers.

757
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,480
That's all we need to do.

758
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,510
Come on, let's have tea.

759
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,360
Cheers.

760
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,000
This tree

761
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,420
was planted by the founder of Wester Sect

762
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,740
for Sovereign Su.

763
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,070
Although the great battle 16 years ago

764
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,480
turned it into a dead tree,

765
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,610
we nourished it with spiritual power.

766
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,350
Now it has not only revived,

767
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,350
but it's even more lush and verdant.

768
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,190
This is the record of Wester Sect's sovereigns.

769
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,360
It tells the story of

770
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,320
Wester Sect's founder Mu Qingge

771
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,110
and Su Yishui.

772
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,710
I've heard

773
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,630
they are now traveling the world,

774
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,960
vanquishing demons and devils.

775
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,840
They truly are a match made in heaven.

776
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,920
I wonder if they've

777
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,440
attained ascension and become immortals?

778
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,700
Attaining ascension?

779
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,000
How boring.

780
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,280
In our Wester Sect's cultivation,

781
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,720
we never seek ascension.

782
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,360
We just want to stay in this mortal world,

783
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,420
eating, playing, and enjoying life.

784
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,190
Isn't that much better than being an immortal?

785
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,070
Brother, wait for me!

786
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
Hurry up, hurry up!

787
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,590
It's time to eat.

788
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,280
Mom.

789
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,310
The porridge spilled.

790
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,300
Shui.

791
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,510
The eldest spilled the porridge.

792
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,880
I've been cleaning, cooking, and taking care of our third child.

793
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Now you want me to take care of

794
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,920
the porridge the eldest spilled, too?

795
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,710
It can't be helped.

796
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,070
You drew the apprentice lot.

797
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,880
So of course, you're responsible for all the housework.

798
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,710
Yesterday, when I was the apprentice,

799
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,290
who was the one playing Qin

800
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,880
while watching me fix the chicken coop,

801
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,410
getting my hands all dirty?

802
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,110
Fine.

803
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,240
You're in for it tonight.

804
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,630
Your luck with drawing lots has always been bad.

805
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,030
If we have a fourth child,

806
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,450
I'm afraid you won't be able to keep up.

807
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,230
Father.

808
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,480
Are the crispy pastries ready?

809
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,880
I really want to eat them.

810
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,050
Alright, alright.

811
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm making them now.

812
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,760
They'll be ready soon.

813
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
You go play for a while.

814
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,400
Okay.

815
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,450
Don't stay in the sun for too long.

816
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,970
The meal will be ready soon.

817
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,960
As expected,

818
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,950
where the Divine Tree is,

819
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,280
that's home.
