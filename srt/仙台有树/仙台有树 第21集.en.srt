[Love of the Divine Tree]

2
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,940
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,400
Come, have some more.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,229
Ranran,

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,789
the runes you sent

6
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,840
are the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,950
This is the very formation that the Heavenly Sects

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,350
used to kill Mu back then.

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,230
Who would dare use this formation

10
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,150
to harm the people of Mount Wester?

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,120
This formation is intricate and mysterious.

12
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,430
Apart from the sovereigns of the Four Sects

13
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,520
who set up this formation back then,

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,650
no one else should be able to master it.

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,910
Everyone's technique for writing runes

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,240
is slightly different.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
If you still have a clear memory

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,940
of the runes in the formation,

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,240
you might be able to compare the writing techniques

20
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
to deduce who's behind this.

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,090
None of these are it.

22
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Then who could it be

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,260
that set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation?

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
It's this one.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
[Wu]

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,570
Mu Ranwu.

27
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,400
She collaborated with the Heavenly Sects back then

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,750
to set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation

29
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,810
against Mu Qingge.

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Of course she would know how to do it.

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
If Mu Qingge isn't really Mu Qingge,

32
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,280
she's likely to be...

33
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,670
Someone broke into Consonance Palace.

34
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,110
That's right.

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,470
The same rune-writing technique.

36
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,560
I was right.

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
The one Master sacrificed himself

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,210
to resurrect was not Grandmaster,

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,750
but Mu Ranwu, who also disappeared

40
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,150
in the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

41
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,150
Master protected the wrong person!

42
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,520
Master,

43
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,630
I have something to tell you.

44
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,160
It's about Grandmaster's identity.

45
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
It's very important!

46
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,560
Master?

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,630
Master Mu,

48
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,200
why are you here?

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,060
I'm keeping your Master company, of course.

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,570
Su Yishui

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,860
always says one thing but means another.

52
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,560
He wants to be intimate with me,

53
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,890
yet he's afraid to do so.

54
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,360
Master Mu, you are

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,159
a free and transcendent person,

56
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,750
yet now, you move between Mr. Yu

57
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,950
and my Master.

58
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,160
It's truly surprising.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,190
Yu and Shui

60
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,530
both wish I can

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,020
spend more time with them.

62
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,870
They don't mind.

63
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,950
It's not your place, youngster,

64
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,150
to gossip about this.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,720
Yes.

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,580
If you would stay at Mount Wester,

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,870
Master would be overjoyed.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,210
He wouldn't have to keep

69
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,920
the dried longan you made for him,

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
pining away.

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,480
Nor would he need to play every day

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,210
your favorite "Moonlit Night"

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
with no audience.

74
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,400
It's good that you know.

75
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,200
In your Master's heart,

76
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,550
there's no room for anyone else.

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,390
So, you don't

78
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,830
even know the name

79
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,270
of your favorite melody?

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,620
You're testing me.

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,040
When did you find out?

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,870
And how did you figure it out?

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,740
You've been deceiving Master all along.

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Do you dare to admit

85
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
who you really are in front of Master?

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Who I am

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,930
doesn't matter.

88
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,030
What matters is who

89
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,050
Su Yishui believes I am.

90
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,600
Why don't you go tell Su Yishui?

91
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,770
Guess how he'll react.

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,720
Don't you know how obsessive

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
your Master is?

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,070
He's guilt-ridden

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,450
about Mu Qingge's death

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,280
and hates himself to death.

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,430
He disabled his core and risked his life

98
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,510
to bring back a life.

99
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,570
How precious it is!

100
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,950
He's only willing

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
and only wants to believe

102
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
that Mu Qingge has returned.

103
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,480
Master wouldn't be so blind.

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,640
Is that so?

105
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,390
You think your Master

106
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,540
doesn't see as clearly as you do?

107
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,680
It's just a matter of whether he wants to delve deeper

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
or if he's willing to believe it.

109
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,870
Some people live their entire lives

110
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,640
preferring to deceive themselves and others.

111
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,970
This wood is one with my heart.

112
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,750
May it always

113
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,830
accompany you.

114
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,310
Give it back to me!

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
Give what back to you?

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,130
The hairpin or your Master?

117
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,680
What right do you have to demand anything?

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
You...

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Xue Ranran!

120
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,410
Master,

121
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,870
you've been deceived by this person.

122
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,070
She's not Mu Qingge, she's...

123
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,670
Nonsense.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,750
Get out now.

125
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,310
This person before us,

126
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,630
from temperament to preferences,

127
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,120
is nothing like Grandmaster.

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
She doesn't even know

129
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,310
the origin of the dried longan

130
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,430
you have or her own

131
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,270
favorite melody.

132
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,750
Master, why do you still believe her?

133
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,350
Why shouldn't I believe her?

134
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,510
She's the one I personally brought back

135
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,170
and watched over for 18 years.

136
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
No one knows her better than I do.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
Have you finished causing a scene?

138
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,780
Get out now.

139
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,360
How dare you sneak into my room

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,690
and mess with my things?

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm helping you,

142
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,920
Su Yishui.

143
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
You're so cruel.

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
You just went along with it

145
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,750
and used me to drive Xue Ranran away.

146
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,830
Won't you thank me?

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,120
It seems you've made up your mind

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,320
to stay away from her.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,390
You actually activated the Resentment Liquid!

150
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,450
Aren't you afraidâ€”

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,950
I know what you're up to.

152
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,480
You're desperately trying to drive a wedge between Ranran and me

153
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,150
because you want her

154
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,270
to leave the protection of Mount Wester

155
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,320
to your advantage.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,650
But I warn you, Mu Ranwu.

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,510
Even if Ranran leaves Mount Wester,

158
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,320
no one will be able to harm her in the slightest.

159
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,250
Especially you.

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
I'll make you wish you were dead.

161
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,200
This is the antidote to the Resentment Liquid.

162
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,870
After you take it and recover,

163
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,930
get out of Mount Wester immediately.

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Su Yishui,

165
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,910
I won't end it like this.

166
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,060
Wait, Immortal Master Mu.

167
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
She completed building her Foundation

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,720
and she's hard to counter now.

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,650
In this new life,

170
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,570
am I still not better than her?

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,960
Ranran!

172
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,410
Master, look quickly.

173
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,600
Su Yishui,

174
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
your rebellious disciple repeatedly provokes me.

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
Why don't you punish her properly?

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
Master, you must have seen it.

177
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Her technique of drawing runes

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
is the same as the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation

179
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,240
that trapped us.

180
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,840
She's the one who harmed us.

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
She's not Mu Qingge at all.

182
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
She is Mu Ranwu.

183
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,200
Master,

184
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,110
I know this is hard to accept.

185
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,150
But

186
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,960
if you look at Mu Ranwu's

187
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,630
rune-drawing technique,

188
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,960
you'll understand everything.

189
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,420
Enough.

190
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,340
I don't need any proof.

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Master, are you still deceiving yourself?

192
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,410
Aren't you leaving yet?

193
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,240
Why?

194
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,880
Master, why

195
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,530
won't you listen to what I'm saying?

196
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,600
Even Mr. Yu has noticed

197
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,870
that this Mu Qingge is off.

198
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,150
How can you not see it?

199
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,480
I am the one who truly understands

200
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,150
Mu Qingge,

201
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,360
not Su Yu.

202
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,840
You must be confused.

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
She's not just impersonating Mu Qingge.

204
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,150
She even set up the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation,

205
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,600
almost killing all of us.

206
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,370
Because of her,

207
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,440
Xi'er was unconscious for days.

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,170
Master, do you still want to blindly protect her?

209
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,420
I don't believe it.

210
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,440
You're not someone

211
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,880
who disregards others' lives.

212
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,960
What do you know about me?

213
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,890
I've always done as I pleased,

214
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
without regard for others' lives.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,930
That's not true.

216
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,520
You clearlyâ€”

217
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,180
You think you know me well?

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,360
You have no idea

219
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,970
what Mu Qingge means to me.

220
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,400
You shouldn't haveâ€”

221
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,930
I shouldn't have revealed the truth.

222
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,270
You would rather live in a lie

223
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,230
and be trapped in delusions.

224
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,550
So what?

225
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,960
Who do you think you are

226
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,220
to try to influence me?

227
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,570
Xue Ranran,

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,500
as long as you're my disciple,

229
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,750
you must respect me as your master

230
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,350
and follow the path I've set.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,150
If you're unwilling,

232
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,240
you must first have the ability to finish your training.

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,080
Otherwise, leaving Mount Wester,

234
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,360
going to the capital,

235
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,630
and seeking some kind of belonging

236
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,760
are all just a dream.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Since you're unable to distinguish right from wrong,

238
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,460
then it's better for me

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,530
to not stay on Mount Wester.

240
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,360
Your Golden Core is not formed yet.

241
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't even pass through Mount Wester's

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
Breaking Dawn Formation.

243
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,840
You're not qualified to finish your training.

244
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,440
I will participate

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,030
in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Trial at Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

246
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,750
I will enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

247
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,080
I will, in the shortest time possible,

248
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
advance and form my core,

249
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,820
and break through the formation.

250
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,510
I will

251
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,380
leave Mount Wester.

252
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Very well.

253
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,270
Elite disciples

254
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,670
from all major Heavenly Sects will participate in

255
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,390
the Trial,

256
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,390
but there's only one spot for the Marrow-Cleansing.

257
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,120
I'd like to see

258
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,520
if you have what it takes.

259
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
Don't just talk the talk.

260
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,840
If you can't pass the trial, you'll be a laughingstock.

261
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,300
Master, just wait and see.

262
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,360
I will definitely enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and advance,

263
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,670
remember everything about the Spirit Spring in the netherworld,

264
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,730
and repay your kindness in my own way.

265
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,240
Then I will...

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,670
leave you.

267
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,470
You may leave.

268
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,440
Yes.

269
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,180
The last blockage of the Four-Way Waterways

270
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,480
is on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

271
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,150
Yes.

272
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,770
Heavenly Meridian Mountain was originally an immortal realm.

273
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,720
Without the collective spiritual power of the Heavenly Ones,

274
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,980
it cannot be accessed.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,150
The upcoming Marrow-Cleansing Conference

276
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,840
is the perfect opportunity to enter Heavenly Meridian Mountain

277
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,240
and clear the waterways.

278
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,090
The Marrow-Cleansing Conference...

279
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,680
Ranran will surely attend, won't she?

280
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,250
Your Highness, are you...

281
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,280
Don't worry.

282
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,870
I know my priorities.

283
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,440
Clearing the Four-Way Waterways

284
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,300
has always been the top priority.

285
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,180
These hands of mine

286
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,600
need to possess even more power

287
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,150
to grasp everything I desire.

288
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,620
I will no longer

289
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,870
hand over opportunities that belong to me

290
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,360
to anyone else.

291
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,140
Are you really going to use this favor

292
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,320
to save your brother?

293
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,360
He is my brother.

294
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,840
Nothing is more important

295
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,030
than his safety.

296
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,120
Okay.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
I promise you.

298
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,390
I considered brotherly affection,

299
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,390
only to be repaid with a wolf

300
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,390
that wants to devour and replace me.

301
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,580
My dear second brother...

302
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,240
In order to seize the position of Crown Prince,

303
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,300
he planted a deadly poison in my body.

304
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,120
He truly wants to kill me.

305
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,730
Your Highness,

306
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,250
heaven's will surely favors you.

307
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,390
Indeed.

308
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,480
Sometimes I don't even know

309
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
if fate is favoring me

310
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,430
or trying to kill me.

311
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,010
The poison has no cure,

312
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,360
yet I've managed to cling to life until now.

313
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,360
Year after year, I go to the Spirit Lake of Mount Absolute

314
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,340
to suppress the poison and recuperate,

315
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,000
waiting for Qingge to return.

316
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,710
Little did I know, I had already reunited with her.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,270
Now, after all this time,

318
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,670
I've finally confirmed that Ranran is her.

319
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,510
Yet you tell me

320
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,110
that I don't have much time left to live?

321
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,320
The poison

322
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,390
has already entered your heart, veins, and bones.

323
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,150
With a mortal body,

324
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
you naturally cannot hold on for much longer.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,630
But once the Four-Way Waterways are cleared,

326
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,030
your years of planning

327
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
will surely succeed.

328
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,910
You will attain longevity.

329
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,200
Good.

330
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,670
Only then can I fulfill my lifelong wish:

331
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,400
peace throughout the universe

332
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,840
and my loved one by my side forever.

333
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Then, Your Highness,

334
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,240
what

335
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,450
are your plans for Xue Ranran?

336
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,530
Ranran will return to my side.

337
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,000
I've waited for her for so long.

338
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,170
A little longer won't matter.

339
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,000
At the Marrow-Cleansing Conference,

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
Su Yishui will surely find a way

341
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,550
to ensure she enters the Marrow-Cleansing Pool smoothly.

342
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,550
Let's discuss this once everything

343
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,810
has settled.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,460
Report!

345
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,130
Your Highness,

346
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,150
she has returned.

347
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,960
She just entered Madam Battle's Palace.

348
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,790
Your Highness says she is not Madam Battle.

349
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,650
Then who is she?

350
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Who else could she be?

351
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,840
She's that

352
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,930
ungrateful wretch,

353
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,690
just like my second brother?

354
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,910
The Mu Ranwu whom Mu Qingge protected

355
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,120
yet got killed by.

356
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,790
I'll arrest her right away.

357
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,390
No need.

358
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,940
Since she dares to return,

359
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,680
I might as well

360
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,280
still treat her as Mu Qingge.

361
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,480
After all, the Heavenly Meridian Mountain can only be

362
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,609
entered by Heavenly Ones eligible for

363
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,530
the Marrow-Cleansing Conference.

364
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,240
I still need her to open

365
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,760
the last waterway.

366
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,359
I'll arrange everything

367
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,500
for you right away.

368
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,750
It's not just about arranging for her

369
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,810
to go to Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

370
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,560
Recently, my third brother

371
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,890
has been hesitant

372
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,700
to make any big moves

373
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,960
because Madam Battle has been around me.

374
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,010
Given his temperament,

375
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,250
he won't hold back for long.

376
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,340
He will surely make a move against Madam Battle.

377
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,270
Let her be the target.

378
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,430
[Madam Battle's Palace]

379
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,070
Qingge.

380
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,400
I've just come back

381
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,220
and you're here already.

382
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,810
You're keeping such a close eye on me.

383
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
I was very worried about you.

384
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,440
I never wanted you to leave the capital.

385
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
I know you love your freedom,

386
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,640
but now the Heavenly Sects can hardly tolerate you.

387
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,370
Wei Jiu also has his eyes on you.

388
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,510
I had no choice but to send

389
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,110
my shadow guard to follow you

390
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,280
and protect you.

391
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,590
Who knew that useless fool would lose track of you.

392
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,590
Fortunately, you returned safely.

393
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm fine.

394
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,430
I was just wandering around.

395
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,410
I also gathered some spiritual herbs

396
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
to refine pills for His Majesty,

397
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,220
so you won't worry.

398
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,050
You're still the same,

399
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,630
always thinking of me in everything.

400
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,350
But I want you

401
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,730
to think more for yourself.

402
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
I understand you.

403
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,750
You're the kind of person who wants to

404
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,410
take control of your own life.

405
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,160
So,

406
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
even though I really want to

407
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,120
marry you and bring you into the Eastern Palace immediately,

408
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,150
I don't want to hold you back.

409
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,090
So you don't want to marry me anymore?

410
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,490
How could that be possible?

411
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm thinking what you're thinking.

412
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,620
I know

413
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,790
the Heavenly Marrow-Cleansing Conference is about to begin.

414
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,390
To regain your former power,

415
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,480
you must certainly strive for

416
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,110
this opportunity at the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

417
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,610
Right?

418
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Of course.

419
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,070
However, this

420
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,640
is not easy

421
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,350
for me now.

422
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,880
Qingge.

423
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,470
I've already thought of a solution for you.

424
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,080
If you need

425
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,750
top-grade spiritual and magical artifacts

426
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,210
from the Exotic Pavilion,

427
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,370
feel free to take them.

428
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,500
I'll be waiting for you

429
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,290
to fulfill your wishes

430
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
and marry me

431
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,230
without any regrets.

432
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,640
How does that sound?

433
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,630
Good.

434
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,070
Ranran.

435
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,550
I smell

436
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,650
something burning.

437
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,830
Looks like you're really anxious

438
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,890
to get to the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

439
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,590
Ranran,

440
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,860
why don't you rest a bit after your practice?

441
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,350
We just went down the mountain to shop

442
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,480
and bought you lots of delicious food.

443
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,160
We also picked up your letter at the mountain gate.

444
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,420
It's from the capital.

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Ranran,

446
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,200
I hope you successfully enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

447
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,800
When you leave Mount Wester,

448
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,400
come to the capital as promised.

449
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
What does the letter say?

450
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,120
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

451
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,110
There's also a gift with the letter.

452
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,030
Master.

453
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,110
These spiritual materials and treasures

454
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,000
are all top-grade collections from the palace.

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,830
They can aid in your cultivation.

456
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,960
Self-righteous.

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Why must you be like this?

458
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,270
What?

459
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,700
You can't bear to part with his gifts?

460
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,440
Yes.

461
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,110
You wield the Sword of Non-Attachment,

462
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,310
yet you remain trapped in past attachments.

463
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,080
You're becoming more and more unreasonable.

464
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,110
Even if you resent Mr. Yu

465
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,510
because of Grandmaster,

466
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,830
you have no right to dispose of

467
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,310
the gifts my friend gave me.

468
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,040
Next time...

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,400
No.

470
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,160
Anyway, you will soon

471
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
have no right to interfere anymore.

472
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,510
Is Ranran rebelling?

473
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,960
You're so slow.

474
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,350
Ranran and Master

475
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,960
have been in a cold war for so long.

476
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,310
Haven't you noticed that recently when Ranran cooks,

477
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,440
there's not even a portion for Master?

478
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,350
-Why?
-Why?

479
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,620
Don't ask.

480
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,260
We can't help anyway.

481
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,290
Why do you have to suppress yourself so much?

482
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,850
This will only make you lose everything.

483
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I said

484
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,630
I can help you.

485
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey, is it necessary for you

486
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,330
to be so harsh on Ranran?

487
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,720
Didn't you say that after entering

488
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,980
the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and forming

489
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,880
the Golden Core, she can live

490
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,680
how she wants?

491
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,550
Even if she wants to go to the capital

492
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,480
and mingle with Su Yu,

493
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,740
you can't control her.

494
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,260
I, Su Yishui, am not a good person,

495
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,790
but Su Yu

496
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,120
is nothing good either.

497
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,360
Is he worthy of trust?

498
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,790
The spiritual materials he arrogantly sent

499
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,520
were useless

500
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,030
and even detrimental to Ranran's cultivation.

501
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,890
Can't you just explain it nicely?

502
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Why do you have to make it seem like

503
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,490
you and Ranran will never interact with each other again?

504
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:21,970
Indeed.

505
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,560
Ranran has her own life to live.

506
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,730
I have my own path to follow too.

507
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
We were always destined to go on

508
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
two different paths.

509
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,410
[Sovereign of Wester Sect] [Mu Qingge] [Xue Ranran]

510
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,510
Bai.

511
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,310
Thank you.

512
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
I'm fine now.

513
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,390
One shouldn't trap oneself.

514
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,210
We must always move forward

515
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,440
and do what needs to be done, right?

516
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,160
I'll set off tomorrow

517
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,960
to Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

518
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,270
I've made

519
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,720
enough spiritual pills for you.

520
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
They're with Mr. Yu Tong.

521
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,560
Remember to take them daily

522
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
to replenish your spiritual power.

523
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,690
Guardian, a visitor has arrived.

524
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,240
I was escorting Hollow Sect disciples to Heavenly Meridian Mountain

525
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,640
and passed by your place.

526
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,380
Have a seat.

527
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,160
Actually...

528
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,970
Actually, I'm here to see her.

529
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,880
She goes by Xue Ranran now, right?

530
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,310
I mean no harm.

531
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,690
I've known from the beginning

532
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,110
that the Mu Qingge born on Mount Absolute

533
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,790
was a fake.

534
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,270
All this time,

535
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,080
I've been watching her.

536
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,410
And it's obvious

537
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,480
who you, Su Yishui,

538
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,010
have been protecting.

539
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,480
So?

540
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:54,720
Technically,

541
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,590
I should report this

542
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,320
to the sovereigns of all sects.

543
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,640
They're eager to find out

544
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,590
the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring.

545
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,790
And the real Mu Qingge

546
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,680
is the key.

547
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,760
But don't worry,

548
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,850
I haven't told anyone.

549
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,510
The Spirit Spring has nothing to do with her.

550
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,970
The Spirit Spring is in me.

551
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,130
I will seal it back to the netherworld.

552
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,690
You're quite frank with me.

553
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
The Heavenly Sects still want the Spirit Spring.

554
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,160
Troubling her would be pointless.

555
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,710
You don't need to see her either.

556
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,310
She's not Mu Qingge anymore.

557
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,550
Nineteen years ago, I knew

558
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,790
your reason for reviving her

559
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,520
wasn't to break your own curse.

560
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,310
Nor was it for any

561
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,970
of the reasons you mentioned.

562
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,410
You love her.

563
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,210
That's something I've known even longer.

564
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,620
That's why I was so jealous

565
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,270
that I tried to drive a wedge between you two

566
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,200
and lied about her disfiguring me.

567
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,790
But...

568
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Everyone believed it.

569
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,690
Except for you.

570
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,720
Because she would never

571
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,750
stoop so low.

572
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,440
So I thought it through.

573
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,790
What I tried to seize before,

574
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,810
what I've been waiting for all this time,

575
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,280
should've been let go long ago.

576
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,450
Regarding the Spirit Spring,

577
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,000
if you're willing to trust me,

578
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
-I can help youâ€”
-No need.

579
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,650
I've heard that

580
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,510
for the key to open the netherworld,

581
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,050
one must wait

582
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,180
for a specific time.

583
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Or do you

584
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,140
have another passage to reach the netherworld?

585
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,430
Oh, right.

586
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,340
Did Mu Qingge already find

587
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,350
that passage

588
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,200
back then?

589
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,370
What do you know?

590
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,750
I was young and impetuous back then.

591
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,420
I secretly followed her

592
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,080
for a while.

593
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,030
Xuantian Teachings?

594
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,350
Why is this demoness looking for a passage

595
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,480
to the netherworld?

596
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,750
But I didn't follow her for long

597
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,750
before I lost her.

598
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,530
Later, demons ran rampant.

599
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,010
It's all in the past now.

600
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,200
Xuantian Teachings?

601
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,390
Guardian,

602
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,920
my brother and I have searched through

603
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,320
the catalog and library.

604
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,640
Mount Wester originally housed

605
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
the Xuantian Teachings,

606
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,510
but 19 years ago, after you went into seclusion,

607
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,640
Su Yu came to claim

608
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Mu Qingge's belongings.

609
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,350
He took some things with him.

610
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,480
The Xuantian Teachings

611
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,340
was among them.

612
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,550
Does the Xuantian Teachings

613
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,270
really contain information about

614
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,330
another passage to the netherworld?

615
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,750
But the Xuantian Teachings has existed for a century.

616
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,310
How come no one

617
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,770
had discovered it before?

618
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,520
We'll know once we get

619
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,950
the Xuantian Teachings.

620
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,960
It seems after the Marrow-Cleansing Conference,

621
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
I must go visit Su Yu.

622
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,760
We're going to

623
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,960
Heavenly Meridian Mountain for the trial today.

624
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,360
Will Master really not give us some advice?

625
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,830
Regardless of Master's intentions,

626
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,920
as disciples, we should show

627
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,850
proper respect.

628
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,310
I, Disciple Xue Ranran,

629
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,880
am setting off to Heavenly Meridian Mountain with my fellow disciples.

630
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,680
I've come to inform you, Master.

631
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,510
After I enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

632
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,840
and form my Golden Core,

633
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,480
I'll return to perform the graduation ceremony

634
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,810
and bid farewell to Mount Wester forever.

635
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,500
Ranran, you...

636
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,400
Ranran,

637
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,240
I know you're upset,

638
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,550
but if you speak without leaving

639
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,310
any room for reconciliation because of this

640
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,960
and put yourself in danger,

641
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,760
wouldn't that

642
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,970
make people even more worried?

643
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,350
I've been reflecting these days

644
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
and I've realized

645
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
our Master is very good to us.

646
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,160
Don't say things out of anger anymore.

647
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,240
Thank you, Seniors,

648
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,080
but I've made up my mind.

649
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,010
I must enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

650
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,970
-Master.
-Master.

651
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,030
If you can enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool and form a Golden Core,

652
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,720
I wouldn't force such a capable disciple

653
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,680
to stay.

654
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,200
It's just a pity that

655
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
you don't have such ability.

656
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Take more magical tools and talismans,

657
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,000
lest you fail to graduate

658
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
and become a laughingstock.

659
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,740
Thank you, Master.

660
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,410
Thank you, Master.

661
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,880
This Marrow-Cleansing Pool

662
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,960
is not something anyone can enter.

663
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,750
Are you so confident

664
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,550
that Master can make it through?

665
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,750
I have my own arrangements.

666
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,720
What arrangements?

667
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,380
Seclusion.

668
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,780
Seclusion?

669
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
Master is taking a risk and you're going into seclusion?

670
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,000
Are you heartless,

671
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,600
Su Yishui?

672
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,270
Su Yishui!

673
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,120
[Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

674
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,440
Heavenly Meridian Mountain is just ahead.

675
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,300
We've arrived.

676
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,750
You don't need to worry about my affairs.

677
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,120
Even if I leave Mount Wester,

678
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,450
we'll still be fellow disciples for life.

679
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,010
You're leaving

680
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,470
because of Master, right?

681
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,400
Whether it is or isn't doesn't matter.

682
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
I never intended

683
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,480
to become a Heavenly expert.

684
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
Isn't it better to enjoy life's pleasures?

685
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,770
Besides,

686
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,400
we haven't even seen the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

687
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,860
Isn't it ridiculous to be so gloomy about it?

688
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
According to the old rules,

689
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,400
the first to find

690
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,000
the Marrow-Cleansing Pool on Heavenly Meridian Mountain

691
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
is the winner.

692
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,440
However, the Heavenly Meridian Mountain

693
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,720
is under the restrictions of the great Dun Tian,

694
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,050
so we can't fly on swords

695
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,040
or use teleportation techniques.

696
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,240
Moreover,

697
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,270
the sovereigns and elders of each sect

698
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,960
have already entered Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

699
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,620
Therefore,

700
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,450
they can't enter again to protect their disciples.

701
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,480
I've researched the ancient texts.

702
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,510
This Marrow-Cleansing Pool wasn't

703
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,880
in the mortal world before.

704
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,450
It was in a secret area of the Immortal Realm.

705
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,350
It was discovered by

706
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,000
Dun Tian, the founder of the Eternal Sect.

707
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,960
He greatly increased his cultivation by cleansing his marrow here,

708
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,720
which later allowed him to attain ascension.

709
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,750
After his ascension, he deliberately opened this place,

710
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,590
making it accessible once every 19 years.

711
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,470
That's how the Marrow-Cleansing Pool became this blessed land.

712
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,030
Fortunately, this place

713
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,000
is controlled by the righteous Heavenly Sects.

714
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Even if we don't succeed,

715
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,320
it shouldn't be too dangerous.

716
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,480
We need to be extremely careful.

717
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,480
Since it's controlled by the Heavenly sects,

718
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,110
demonic cultivators shouldn't be able to enter.

719
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,350
Isn't it a bit excessive

720
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,750
to be so cautious?

721
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,880
One can only enter Heavenly Meridian Mountain once in a lifetime.

722
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,830
And once you enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool,

723
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,160
it's equivalent to skipping half a lifetime of arduous cultivation.

724
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Under such competition and temptation,

725
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,360
anything can happen.

726
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,450
Mu Qingge

727
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,310
has such high cultivation

728
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,720
and she's still competing for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

729
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,750
She's so vicious.

730
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,880
After all, she's reborn.

731
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,030
She's never entered Heavenly Meridian Mountain before,

732
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,510
so

733
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,210
it's not against the rules.

734
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:37,830
Ranran.

735
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,620
Be careful!

736
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,480
Are you alright?

737
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,440
These vines suck blood.

738
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,480
We don't know how many

739
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,510
blood-sucking vines are ahead.

740
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,239
How are we going to get through?

741
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,590
Come to me!

742
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,540
Quickly.

743
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,860
Watch out for these vines!

744
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,570
Who is that person?

745
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,150
Why is he using demonic magic?

746
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,070
I heard he's the new disciple

747
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,000
of Lingdi Sect

748
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
named Gui Baqian.

749
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,840
I've never heard before that

750
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,670
there was such a figure in the Heavenly Sect.

751
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,070
The main peak is just ahead.

752
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,469
Let's put in more effort.

753
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,679
Let's go.

754
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,960
I can't go on.

755
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,590
This is a matter of life and death.

756
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't hold on anymore.

757
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
The Marrow-Cleansing Pool

758
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,060
is just ahead on the main peak.

759
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,290
But right in front of us

760
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,110
is such a wide cliff.

761
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,800
My spiritual power is almost exhausted

762
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,600
and we're faced with this cliff.

763
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,440
Since we can't fly on our swords,

764
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
how can we get across?

765
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,630
If I use all my power to control Divine Tree,

766
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,660
I can form a bridge for us to cross.

767
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,940
Ranran,

768
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,050
do you have any strength left?

769
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,830
Let's give it a try and see.

770
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,280
It worked!

771
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
Now if I use spiritual power to stabilize myself,

772
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,550
I can cross.

773
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,840
Ranran!

774
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,560
Come to me!

775
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,740
You can make it!

776
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,220
Forget it, Ranran.

777
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,210
I was lucky to make it through

778
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,190
the previous checkpoints.

779
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,440
I really don't have the strength to go any further.

780
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,880
I've gained enough experience.

781
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,290
The journey wasn't in vain.

782
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,460
I'll stop here.

783
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,280
Since Xi'er is staying here,

784
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,930
I'll stay here to keep her company.

785
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,370
I'm under punishment.

786
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,400
I was never destined for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool anyway.

787
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,070
Being able to come and see Heavenly Meridian Mountain

788
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,190
is already great.

789
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,190
Ranran,

790
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,560
be careful on your journey.

791
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,000
Wait for my return!

792
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,280
Ranran,

793
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,730
if it's too dangerous, just forget about it.

794
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,030
You don't need to complete your training.

795
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,030
Eating and drinking on Mount Wester

796
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,950
is good enough.

797
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,760
[Main Peak Cave of Heavenly Meridian Mountain]

798
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,550
Senior,

799
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,300
I found this sword first!

800
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:02,920
Get out of my way!

801
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,120
If I see it, it's mine!

802
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,070
The main peak

803
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,670
has heavenly treasures everywhere.

804
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,630
The great Dun Tian left countless treasures

805
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,710
in this cave.

806
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,360
It's just a mirror.

807
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,800
Why bother fighting with your sister over it?

808
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,460
Why don't you choose another treasure instead?

809
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,840
We came to Heavenly Meridian Mountain

810
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,630
for the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

811
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,210
Why has everyone forgotten our original purpose

812
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,470
and started fighting over other things?

813
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,230
Give it to me!

814
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,830
Don't run!

815
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,710
It's mine!

816
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,040
Give it to me! It's mine!

817
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,710
Why is there

818
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,170
a little bird tied up here?

819
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,690
Its feet are all chafed.

820
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
Did the great Dun Tian tie you up?

821
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,150
Little bird, wait a moment.

822
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,710
I'll help stop the bleeding right away.

823
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,840
You have a good eye.

824
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,920
There are many treasures on the main peak

825
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,320
of Heavenly Meridian Mountain,

826
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,680
but this Vermilion Bird is the most precious of all.

827
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,920
It is the most powerful

828
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,190
purifying and demon-expelling divine object in the world.

829
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,480
You're indeed clever.

830
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,490
You know to fight for the most valuable thing.

831
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,920
I don't understand what you're talking about.

832
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,030
You always have this

833
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,070
lofty air,

834
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,700
but in reality,

835
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,920
you hold onto all the benefits

836
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,050
and refuse to let go.

837
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,000
It truly makes me sick.

838
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,400
You really love to talk to yourself.

839
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,480
I'd like to ask you

840
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,150
why you're so obsessed with replacing

841
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,320
Mu Qingge's identity.

842
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,070
Is this false reputation really that good?

843
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,800
Where have you hidden

844
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
the Grandmaster?

845
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
You're asking me?

846
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,000
You should ask your Master about that.

847
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,460
He loves Mu Qingge so much,

848
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,280
if anyone's hiding her, it's him.

849
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,040
Besides,

850
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,760
with his autocratic nature,

851
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,670
he wouldn't bear

852
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,190
to hide Mu Qingge too far away.

853
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,840
Perhaps

854
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,170
she's hidden right by his side.

855
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,150
Cut the nonsense.

856
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,810
Give me the Vermilion Bird.

857
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,790
Vermilion Bird,

858
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,790
you escape first.

859
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,840
Everything in this cave

860
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,070
arouses people's greed.

861
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,550
Now that the Vermilion Bird has flown away,

862
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,150
Master Mu, you can come to your senses.

863
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm perfectly clear-headed.

864
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,960
When you're preaching

865
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,840
your morals, I'm even more

866
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,760
clear-headed.

867
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,230
Today is perfect timing.

868
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,010
So many people die on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

869
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,290
Su Yishui won't know

870
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,920
the truth.

871
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,280
Why don't I choose today

872
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,480
to fulfill my wish?

873
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,070
Bai, how did you get here?

874
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,080
This technique is...

875
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,670
Master?

876
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,670
Bai used Master's technique.

877
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,970
Is it the Soul Control Technique?

878
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,010
Could it be that Master listened to what I said

879
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,360
and believed that Mu Qingge was fake,

880
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,490
so he possessed Bai?

881
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,070
No,

882
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,300
I need to know how Master is doing.

883
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,300
Senior,

884
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,820
please guide me

885
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,800
on how to return to

886
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,070
the main peak of Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

887
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,550
My Master is fighting with someone evil.

888
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,810
I'm worried about him.

889
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,660
You're concerned about your own Master,

890
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,340
but what about other people's herbs?

891
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm sorry,

892
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,800
I was in a hurry.

893
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,400
How about this?

894
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,720
I'm skilled in wood-based magic.

895
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,630
I can help you grow a few

896
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,120
thousand-year-old herbs as an apology.

897
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,880
Please tell me

898
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,920
how I can get back.

899
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,390
As a cultivator, you should know

900
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,490
everything happens for a reason.

901
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
We have no predestined connection.

902
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,370
I can't help you.

903
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,680
How can we not have a connection?

904
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,360
The Alcohol Immortal from Mount Cuiwei

905
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,440
is my friend.

906
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,760
Not long ago,

907
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,420
I even helped him brew a few jars of fine wine.

908
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,630
How do you know that

909
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,480
I know Alcohol Immortal

910
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,390
and how can you be sure

911
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,590
that he and I

912
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,570
are friends, not enemies?

913
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,230
Your wine gourd

914
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,920
is identical to Alcohol Immortal's.

915
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,800
If you were enemies,

916
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,050
why would you carry your enemy's wine gourd

917
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,800
with you?

918
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,590
You, young lady,

919
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
are quite clever.

920
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,950
You're right.

921
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,070
Alcohol Immortal is my younger brother.

922
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,190
I am the Medicine Immortal.

923
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,130
[Medicine Immortal]

924
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,050
Since that's the case,

925
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,820
I'll put your mind at ease.

926
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,640
Every time there's a trial,

927
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
when they reach this Treasure Cave,

928
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,570
the participants can't resist

929
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,030
the temptation of these heavenly treasures.

930
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,630
The higher their cultivation,

931
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,920
the more they want to claim

932
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,320
the best for themselves.

933
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,840
The barrier of greed

934
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,400
is truly difficult to overcome.

935
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,710
Isn't that too harsh?

936
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,360
Failing and being sent away

937
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,960
is enough.

938
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,480
Why take their lives?

939
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,670
Cultivating spiritual power

940
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,000
to achieve immortality

941
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,570
is already defying the natural order.

942
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,770
If one wants to enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool

943
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,420
to gain instant benefits,

944
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,540
they must bear the corresponding risks.

945
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,610
Then, my Master...

946
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,640
This must be your Master, right?

947
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,800
Indeed, it's Master's technique.

948
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,070
Master did use the Soul Control Technique

949
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,150
to possess Bai's body.
