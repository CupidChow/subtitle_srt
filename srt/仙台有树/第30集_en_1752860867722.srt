1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,020
Love at Border

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:22,320
Are you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times,

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
travel to the north and west,

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and only when I have achieved my goal will I understand the value of it.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if I have to go through hundreds of thousands of times,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am destined to be with you.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I am still fearless and never regret.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The love and hate of the world.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You are the mother.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't worry.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When I have solved Su Yishun's problem,

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we can then calculate the punishment for the past life.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will be the mother.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I will be the mother.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will be the mother.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will be the mother.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will be the mother.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will be the mother.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Master, what happened?

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why did you increase your power?

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because the world's front and rear are protected.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The more you are in the mortal world,

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the more you are suppressed in the world of the demon.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So that's why I am the strongest in the world of the demon.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Master, in the world of the demon, I will protect you.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What is that?

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yang Ran, Yun Shu.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
These monsters are very hard to deal with.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They are not going to die.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come with me.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What should we do?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What can we do?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have a plan.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,320
I could kill him all on that night.

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,240
That day's Told-swell ИMaled King

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
pushed her out of the palace

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,480
to let her live.

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,280
That night

42
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
I couldn't open it estimatedly.

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
At that moment

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
I stopped don't other do.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
If you can repeat the battle

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,400
for the marriage irritants

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,120
install a new law

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
I've been keeping track of the demons in the Demon Realm.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,080
If I can't get out of Sanli's territory in an instant,

50
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
I won't be able to get rid of them.

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,440
This gold talisman is the secret sword.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
Even if it's a year of nine flowers,

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
we can only find seven or eight pieces of food.

54
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
There are so many in one gold.

55
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,640
This Shun Xing Talisman is difficult to make.

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,840
I spent a long time to draw it.

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,400
It's just that we have too many people.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
We can't get that far to Sanli.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
We'll still be chased by the demons.

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,720
You'll be touched by the SMG's landslide if the energy increases!

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Si Yi Chuan, based on the sense of privacy,

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,840
you actually see the dissolve-a-san power?

63
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,780
At once!

64
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,140
sword!

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,280
Would you do it after I die?

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,560
With the weakness of the king,

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
and谢谢他…

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Then do it after my death with Heaven.

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,480
don't hurt my master.

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,120
I learnt a magic trick.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
I may have you give away your weapons.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't forget.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,240
Don't be so imprudent.

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,440
I just can't finish!

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,400
Sister!

76
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,560
I can't finish until the split.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,920
laundering

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Peace of prince's life

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
I want you to be in your pockets.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
Boss...

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
What's wrong?

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,320
We escaped after all.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,600
Hierophant, your arm...

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Catching aak, cost me dearly.

85
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,620
Du you should leave now

86
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,660
I know

87
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,420
if you don't report this to the합ника

88
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,600
Feng is었an

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,120
although you won't go

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,240
직 if you don't talk to me

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
there will be too much trouble

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,000
pen of u wanted to go

93
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,740
and will leave

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,040
but is really a good man

95
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,220
you'll drop him

96
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,300
The night, it's not

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Sister Wen,

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
you destroyed the mortal world.

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,360
I have something to do.

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
What's the matter?

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
The monsters down the mountain

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
will not give up.

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
It's easy for us to escape.

104
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,160
But Su Yizhen and Xue Renran

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
are still here.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
I want to win the monsters

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
for them.

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
I'll go with you.

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,760
No.

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,520
You can't just

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
tell me the truth.

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
Leave me here

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,040
and be afraid of death.

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,840
Sister Wen.

115
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Go.

116
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,560
You're hurt.

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Let me see.

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
The Qi of Blood and Meat will attract the monsters.

119
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,960
No need to see it.

120
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,880
Xue Renran said

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,200
you were badly hurt

122
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
and needed to go back to the mortal world.

123
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,160
Is it true?

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
If I ask you to take me back,

125
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,640
will you do as I say?

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Yes.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,920
No.

128
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
So many years at most.

129
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
It is difficult to get the spiritual power.

130
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
Even if I can't get it,

131
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,120
at least I need to

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,560
get the L.I.F.y Sword

133
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
and be again with the Cloud Seong.

134
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
It's just a joke.

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Go, Sun Shang.

136
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,400
If Su Yishui blocks Lingquan later,

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
you'll have no chance.

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,560
But you...

139
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,360
Stay here and wait for me.

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,400
You knew his choice long ago.

141
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,880
Why bother asking?

142
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,800
Tu Jiuyun

143
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,240
deserves to die.

144
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,880
I finally found it.

145
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,520
Yu Sima

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
It's here.

147
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
After the vessel

148
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
falls into water,

149
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,000
it can tamper with Lingquan and freeze the seal.

150
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,520
Hel美國

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
You must do your best to seal Ling Quan.

152
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
I'll protect you.

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
The wind!

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Let me go!

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
You're my son, not the king.

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
If you touch me, you'll regret it.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Two more days,

158
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
and you'll be buried in this big formation.

159
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
How many times do I have to tell you to stop?

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm not going to let you go!

161
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Do you understand?

162
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm not going to let you go!

163
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm not going to let you go!

164
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm not going to let you go!

165
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
You're the descendant of the King of the Five Kingdoms.

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
You can't escape!

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Fei Jiu, you're so annoying.

168
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
What are you going to do?

169
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
You'll know it in the future.

170
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Your disciple, Tu Sun,

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
can't save you anymore.

172
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I've been waiting for so many years.

173
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
So many years?

174
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
You're still so weak.

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
In order to seal you,

176
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
he stole the golden elixir.

177
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
If he succeeds,

178
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
he'll do his best.

179
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Su Yishui,

180
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
if you still have any feelings for your disciple,

181
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
promise me one thing.

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Seal me in the Wangxian Hall.

183
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
You'll return him to the Youjian Realm for me.

184
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Su Yishui,

185
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll never let you go.

186
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I'll never let you go.

187
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I'll never let you go.

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Su Yishui,

189
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
I'll never let you go.

190
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Su Yishui,

191
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I'll never let you go.

192
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I'll do it soon.

193
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
There's only one last drop left.

194
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm waiting for you to pull out the power of the formation

195
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
and seal the spiritual power.

196
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Now I can finally

197
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
release you.

198
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
It's really the Night Spell.

199
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
So many years

200
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
have passed.

201
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Thank you, Wu.

202
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Congratulations, Senior.

203
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Long time no see, Qingge.

204
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
No,

205
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
you should not remember me.

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Now I should call you

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Xue Ranran.

208
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
There's a book here.

209
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
This is the Night Spell, right?

210
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Guess who I'll give this to.

211
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Give it to me.

212
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Give it to me.

213
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Give it to you.

214
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Qingge.

215
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I didn't expect you

216
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
to enter the Youjian Realm.

217
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Night Spell?

218
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
You're here.

219
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Qingge,

220
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
give me the spiritual power.

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You

222
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
are the Night Spell

223
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
that nourishes Mu Qingge.

224
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
You're also the one who stopped her from sealing the power.

225
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Exactly.

226
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Ranran, it's dangerous.

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Don't come near her.

228
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Mu Qingge

229
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
sealed me here before.

230
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Now I'll get the power.

231
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
I'll get it back from her.

232
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
No matter who you are,

233
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
don't disturb my master.

234
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Okay, I'll kill you now.

235
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Ranran.

236
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Master, we've worked so hard

237
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
to get here. We can't waste our time.

238
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
You must seal the power.

239
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Give it to me.

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Stand still!

241
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Stand still!

242
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Master, don't worry.

243
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
I've got the sword and the spell.

244
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I can do it.

245
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Get down.

246
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Don't go, Master.

247
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I've got the sword and the spell.

248
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
I can do it.

249
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I've got the sword and the spell.

250
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,560
Awaken it now

251
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Mr. Bao

252
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,480
You are safe

253
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,200
Get up

254
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,240
Tomorrow

255
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,160
choose

256
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,400
I...

257
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,440
One road

258
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,440
One road

259
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:41,840
The top

260
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
The most dangerous

261
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,020
placing it properly

262
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Ran ran

263
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Feng Ruoling fountain, makes me sad

264
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,820
But it dosen't matter

265
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,500
Now there's another SOS

266
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Master

267
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,480
Who is it?

268
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,980
YoYo & Light seamless

269
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,680
Goodbye

270
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
Please

271
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Master, are you okay?

272
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Where is she?

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Did she meet a monster?

274
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I think she is fine now.

275
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
She ran away first.

276
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I came back to find her.

277
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
She ran away so fast.

278
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
I will settle the score with her later.

279
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Master.

280
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Who are you?

281
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Why do you have the power of my spirit energy?

282
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Master, what's wrong with you?

283
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Don't you dare to stop me from standing on the highest point in this world.

284
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I will kill you right now.

285
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Master, you are awake.

286
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Master.

287
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Who are you?

288
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Why do you call me master?

289
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Master.

290
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Master.

291
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Why?

292
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
You don't have any cultivation.

293
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
How can you have the power of my spirit energy?

294
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Who are you?

295
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
You don't recognize me?

296
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Answer me.

297
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,520
The power of my spirit energy is given to me by you and the save me.

298
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Who do you think I am?

299
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
It's her.

300
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
You are all her helpers.

301
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Wei Xingge.

302
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Wei Xingge.

303
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Wei Xingge.

304
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Wei Xingge.

305
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Wei Xingge.

306
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Get out of here.

307
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Get out.

308
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Okay.

309
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I will kill you first and absorb my spirit energy.

310
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Master.

311
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Master.

312
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I can't.

313
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Yutong.

314
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Yuchen.

315
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
It's us.

316
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Master still remembers us.

317
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Why do you grow up?

318
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,520
We are not the only ones serving you.

319
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
May I ask what year is it now?

320
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
47 years.

321
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Master.

322
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
It's 19 years now.

323
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
According to you, it's been 23 years.

324
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,160
wieder

325
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,520
house

326
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
toss

327
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:13,520
toss

328
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Brother Learns qué

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Lao途

330
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
You have managed

331
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
my family business.

332
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
There is no other way of doing it

333
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
should only be greater.

334
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,800
There's something wrong with the talisman.

335
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,640
I'll ask the Nine Immortals

336
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,280
what the spell is.

337
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,160
I won.

338
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,800
You can't lose.

339
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
The last one.

340
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
I got stuck.

341
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,640
Let's do it again.

342
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
The loser will lose the bet.

343
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,320
We've made a deal.

344
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
The winner of the last round

345
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,080
will be the one who burns the last blanket of the Heavenly Deity.

346
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,520
Liang,

347
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,320
I won the first half of the game.

348
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Let's drink half of the wine.

349
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,040
You're lying.

350
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,640
No.

351
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm telling the truth.

352
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,440
I won the first half of the game.

353
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
I can't find the wine.

354
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,360
Give me half of the wine.

355
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,360
Give it back.

356
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,120
Put the wine down.

357
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,200
Listen to Ran Ran.

358
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,000
She'll ask him to make us wine in the future.

359
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Su Yishui's memory

360
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,560
suddenly returned to more than 20 years ago.

361
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Didn't she forget

362
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,600
the incident that killed Mu Yanzi?

363
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,720
This guy

364
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
even lost his memory.

365
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,840
Ran Ran said

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
someone borrowed a drop of water

367
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,840
and then Su Yishui

368
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
forgot everything.

369
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,480
Do you remember any spells

370
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,560
that can use the water?

371
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,400
Water is not something in the mortal world.

372
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
Who would use water?

373
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Unless it's not in the mortal world.

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,800
You're drunk.

375
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Isn't that nonsense?

376
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,040
Guard an breaths.

377
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,480
Think about it.

378
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,800
What is an important item?

379
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,360
A staff, a喪ardi General fry lamp

380
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:18,520
and a

381
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,440
adaptable cup.

382
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:29,760
The

383
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,300
I among here

384
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,120
源

385
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,580
doctor

386
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,280
told

387
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,280
them to talk anything

388
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,720
nonsense

389
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:47,220
For these fuxxing

390
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,400
but master

391
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Nineteen years ago, the Four Great Plains set up the Nine-Legendary Curse

392
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
and lured Mu Xing Ge into it to kill him.

393
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
You lured me to the West Mountain and humiliated me.

394
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You couldn't have killed him yourself. You're treating him too kindly.

395
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
Those disciples of the West Mountain are my disciples.

396
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Now, I'm the one who took over Mu Xing Ge's West Mountain.

397
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes. The master is now the leader of the West Mountain.

398
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Then, let's get up tomorrow and go to the West Mountain.

399
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
Go to Mu Xing Ge's land to look for him.

400
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,600
See what he has done to me.

401
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,800
Take those disciples of yours who claim to be my disciples,

402
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
especially those who have my spiritual power.

403
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You must not let them escape.

404
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Yes.

405
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Second Senior Brother, let's send them out first.

406
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Okay. See you then.

407
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
Okay.

408
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
How is it?

409
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,200
I still can't remember.

410
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,800
It's better than others.

411
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
Ran Ran, you must be more careful.

412
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,000
The master's memories should have been left in the time when he was just taken away

413
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,400
and wanted Mu Xing Ge to take revenge.

414
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,800
I know that I must hide my identity.

415
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,200
If he knows that I'm Mu Xing Ge,

416
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
he will surely kill me to take the position of general.

417
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
The master said that he wants to go back to the West Mountain tomorrow

418
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
to look for the reason for his loss of memory.

419
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,600
He still thinks that Mu Xing Ge did all of this.

420
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's good. There are many fresh herbs in the West Mountain.

421
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
I also want to quickly make some elixirs

422
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,600
to see if I can help you.

423
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
But the master's current temperament,

424
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
if he sees all these things,

425
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't know what he will do.

426
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It might not be a bad thing.

427
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Even if you lose your memory, you can still learn from the past.

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
It will still be helpful.

429
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,200
What we can do now is not to go against the current and watch the changes.

430
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
How is it?

431
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
I have always complained that my fate is not good.

432
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
But actually, I have been by your side

433
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
for the rest of my life.

434
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,600
Before, I was clearly fine.

435
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,200
How come within a day, I completely changed into a different person?

436
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
Chief Xue,

437
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,400
Chief Xue?

438
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Yes.

439
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,800
I just entered the Immortal-Drawing Qi.

440
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,800
And you have my half of the elixir.

441
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Now you are telling me

442
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,600
that I finally entered the Immortal-Drawing Qi.

443
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Why must you give my elixir to a useless person like you?

444
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
What method did you use?

445
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Why must I use a method?

446
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Master treats me like this

447
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,800
because our relationship is very close.

448
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Our relationship is very close. With you...

449
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Exactly. If you don't believe me,

450
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Master, you can look at the clothes you are wearing. It is very dark in the room.

451
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,200
I made the incense from the wood in your clothes.

452
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I stepped on this elixir.

453
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I also made that wooden hairpin.

454
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,800
And this. I also made this Longyan-Gan for Master.

455
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,000
You dare to insult me?

456
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Get lost!

457
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Xiao Yu, we meet again.

458
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Why are you here?

459
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Don't be surprised.

460
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,000
I was able to come here without any problems.

461
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
I have a medical record.

462
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,400
Medical record?

463
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Because I can help you heal your body.

464
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
Old Fu,

465
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,000
I have a medical record.

466
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
I have a medical record.

467
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,800
I have a medical record.

468
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Old Fu, what is going on?

469
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,800
The wood letter master was entrusted by me.

470
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,200
He has already found that Da Neng.

471
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I have been in the You Realm for many years.

472
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,000
Today, I am finally able to see the sun again.

473
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
I am able to see the Crown Prince.

474
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,200
But speaking of it, I am not that unfamiliar with the Crown Prince.

475
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,200
After all, I have been with the Crown Prince for many years.

476
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,400
You...

477
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,400
You two are one person?

478
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Old Feng is my personal bodyguard.

479
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,400
But now, he is not important anymore.

480
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,600
I was sealed in the You Realm by Mu Qing Ge.

481
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
I am now alone in this world.

482
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,600
At that time, I knew that only you could help me.

483
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,600
So, I became Old Feng and stayed by your side.

484
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Who are you?

485
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,800
This senior is the one who raised me and my sister.

486
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Ye Xing Shu.

487
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Ye Xing Shu.

488
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,600
So, the senior's chess skills

489
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,800
has already come to my side.

490
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,800
Now, I remember what Old Feng did before.

491
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
He kept pretending to be a scheming trick.

492
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Now, I have fallen to this point.

493
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,400
It was actually a conspiracy.

494
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,800
Now, the senior is walking in front of me with his big waist.

495
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Do you really think I am a fool?

496
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Your Highness is smart enough.

497
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
If I use some magical powers,

498
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,400
how can I hide it from Your Highness for so many years?

499
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,200
But today, I am here with my real body.

500
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
I am not trying to be your enemy.

501
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,000
I am trying to cooperate with you.

502
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,600
Cooperating with someone who is scheming with you?

503
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,800
What a joke.

504
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Unless the senior

505
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
gives me the sincerity I deserve.

506
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,000
After all, you want to beg me, right?

507
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Then, what do you think I am begging you for?

508
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,400
I don't know.

509
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,200
After all, someone with such abilities

510
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,400
can get money and power.

511
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,600
They won't stay with me because of this.

512
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,400
You let Lin Quan go to the Mountain of Suyi Water.

513
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,800
After you failed, you still came back to me.

514
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,400
That means I have something you really want.

515
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
Your Highness is really smart.

516
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,600
I used magical powers to force you to turn your body.

517
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,000
In the next half year,

518
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
your body will be like today.

519
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
What about six months later?

520
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,600
Six months later, if our plan succeeds,

521
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
you will not only have the physical strength you have now,

522
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
but also have the ability to make everything come back.

523
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,400
Including the ability to destroy the Mirror.

524
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
You will also be able to use the power of the Mirror

525
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
to destroy the Mirror.

526
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,400
I will also be able to use the power of the Mirror

527
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,800
to destroy the King of Moji,

528
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
and the power you can't get.

529
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,800
And also,

530
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,000
I will be in your hands.

531
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,600
Tell me about your plan.

532
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,600
These mysterious things,

533
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,000
a night star that is not visible to the eyes,

534
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,600
you will never know.

535
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Who are you?

536
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,600
I am Dun Tian.

537
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,200
You are the founder of the Jiuhua Sect,

538
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,000
the world's number one immortal.

539
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
But a few hundred years ago,

540
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Dun Tian was already a immortal.

541
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,000
Why did you turn into a night star?

542
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Why did you turn into a night star?

543
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Everyone has the desire to destroy the Moji.

544
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,800
I am also like that.

545
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Wow, I want to make chicken legs. It smells so good.

546
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Husband, it's time to eat.

547
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Coming soon.

548
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
Sit down.

549
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Wow, why is it so noisy today?

550
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,200
Guess who I will give the first chicken leg to?

551
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
That must be mom.

552
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Smart.

553
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Here, mom worked hard today.

554
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Dun Tian, don't hurt the Moju!

555
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
Don't let go of your wife!

556
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Dad, I'm sorry.

557
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Father, please save us!

558
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Father, please save the child!

559
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Father!

560
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Dun Tian,

561
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,800
the only way to survive is to kill the demons.

562
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
If you let the Demon King go,

563
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,800
you will lose the chance to live for a thousand years.

564
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Think about it.

565
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
No!

566
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,200
I'm begging you. Is there any news?

567
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,800
You want to make your friend reincarnate.

568
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,200
But you can't.

569
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
After you are reborn,

570
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,800
you can't go back to the mortal world.

571
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Even if you have reincarnation,

572
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,800
you have to collect your friend's soul in seven days.

573
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Otherwise, you can't save the dead.

574
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Dun Tian,

575
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,800
the immortal has a long life, but nothing can be done.

576
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,200
You will think about the past.

577
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
But you have been immortal for hundreds of years.

578
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,400
It's too late.

579
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
Forget it.

580
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,200
I will find a way to make our family reunite.

581
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,000
Even if we have to make it happen again.

582
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The immortal said that to make it happen again,

583
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,400
we need a few things.

584
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,000
The most important ones are the spirit power

585
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
and the Demon King's water.

586
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
That's right.

587
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,800
What are you doing?

588
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,000
We are here to take the immortal back to the mountain.

589
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
The Xuan Sect is really generous.

590
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,600
They hired all the famous chefs here.

591
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,200
They are really generous.

592
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,400
Who hired you?

593
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,200
Me.

594
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Master.

595
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,400
I have been patient in this kind of place.

596
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,000
I have to go out to meet the immortal.

597
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,600
What's the difference between what the immortal does and what the beggar does?

598
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,000
Yu Chen, Yu Tong, change the carriage to the golden carriage.

599
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The servants and cooks are not enough. Go find them.

600
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,400
Yes.

601
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Although Master lost his memory,

602
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
he seems to have changed completely.

603
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,600
He never was this insensitive in the West Mountain.

604
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,400
He wasn't like this when he was in the Prince Manor.

605
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
What's going on?

606
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Maybe he was too cautious and depressed since he was little.

607
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,000
He became like this when he released all his emotions.

608
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He has changed. He has changed.

609
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,000
This wooden hairpin, if someone else takes it away next time...

610
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,200
I will never.

611
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,000
I will keep it well.

612
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
This is how I look like when I am a beggar.

613
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,000
Yes.

614
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Yes.

615
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's just...

616
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
a little...

617
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,800
I'm not used to it.

618
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Why doesn't Master let us four get on the carriage?

619
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,400
He wants us to stay away from the carriage.

620
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,600
This mountain seems to be not that big with the carriage.

621
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
No wonder we have to stay away from it.

622
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,600
My father died in the battle of Bingbai. He lost the world.

623
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,800
I came here to bring my disciple.

624
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
I have been living in such a mess for the past ten years.

625
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
It's really ridiculous.

626
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
There is one more thing.

627
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I will ask you when we arrive at the West Mountain.

628
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Think about how you should answer.

629
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Don't forget that I am your master.

630
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,600
I have been living in such a mess for the past ten years.

631
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,400
The Lingxi Palace we just passed by looks very spacious.

632
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,800
Our master's residence is not as good as the Lingxi Palace.

633
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,200
Let's talk about it later. You two, follow me to the Lingxi Palace.

634
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,200
Go.

635
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Go.

636
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,400
Go.

637
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,000
Go.

638
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,800
Ranran.

639
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Ranran, your spiritual energy is not enough. You will hurt yourself if you don't train your elixir.

640
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
I want to wake up Master quickly.

641
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,000
Can you help me think of anything else that can help Master recover his memory?

642
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
Master, it's because your food has been cut off.

643
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,200
He really loves your cooking.

644
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,000
This is Lingxi Palace where Mu Qingge lives?

645
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,200
Yes.

646
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,200
When do you two plan to tell me the truth?

647
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,400
You said that Mu Qingge is dead, but her spirit energy is still in Lingxi Palace.

648
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,600
And that Xue Ranran is clearly missing.

649
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
She's missing my elixir.

650
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,800
She also said that she's close to me.

651
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,600
I can't explain all of this.

652
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
You two didn't tell me the truth.

653
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,200
Tell me now. What's wrong with Mu Qingge?

654
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,800
Or else, you two don't need to keep her.

655
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
I dare not hide it.

656
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,600
Mu Qingge indeed died once.

657
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,600
It's just that Master gave her a reincarnation.

658
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,200
And also gave her a hair-saving ban.

659
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,600
So that everyone won't recognize her.

660
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
What?

661
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm sorry.

662
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm sorry.

663
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm sorry.

664
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
I'm sorry.

665
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,600
I'm sorry.

666
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm sorry.

667
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
I'm sorry.

668
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm sorry.

669
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I'm sorry.

670
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm sorry.

671
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm sorry.

672
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm sorry.

673
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
I'm sorry.

675
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
I'm sorry.

678
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm sorry.

681
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm sorry.

686
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,800
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
I'm sorry.

690
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm sorry.

691
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
I'm sorry.

692
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,800
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
I'm sorry.

695
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm sorry.

696
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,800
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm sorry.

701
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I'm sorry.

702
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
I'm sorry.

721
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
I'm sorry.
