1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will face the love and hate of the world.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish to travel a few times

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to travel to the north and the west.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Only when I have achieved my goal can I understand the value of it.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am destined to be the one to return the favor

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
even if I have to go through hundreds of turns.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I still have no fear or regret.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:45,380
A

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 13

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,880
Good!

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
The artists under Su Yu are very well-known.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,880
The three in the guard

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,400
may have a bright and bright north

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,640
like Lao Feng.

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
It's better not to have any power

16
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
than not to have any.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have an idea.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll go with you.

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
If you are a stranger,

20
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
don't blame me for my sharp sword.

21
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
His power

22
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
is beyond my control.

23
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,240
What do you want to do?

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
Why did Su Yu capture my master?

25
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,160
What did you say?

26
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Your master was captured by Xiao Yu?

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Su Yu is a man

28
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
who can't be easily fooled.

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,120
He will also have a golden day.

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,240
He treats you like that on the mountain.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
Why do you care about him?

32
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
You are laughing too much.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,400
Be careful not to hurt your heart

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
when you meet a knife.

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,120
Xiao Yu captured him.

36
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
It has nothing to do with me.

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,920
Besides, they are

38
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,280
not compatible with each other.

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
Is it because

40
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,360
I hurt Xishan

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,080
that Xiao Yu is jealous?

42
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,960
If you dare to hurt me,

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,720
I will not let you two go.

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
You are lying to yourself.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Are you really so happy?

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,040
Since I entered the palace,

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,600
I have enjoyed the treatment

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
of the Crown Princess.

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
The one he really likes in this world

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,320
is only me.

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
It can only be me.

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,320
I don't have time to talk to you,

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
you crazy woman.

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Your Highness,

55
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
you asked for seven or eight hundred flowers.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,920
Finally, only half a bottle is left.

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
Fortunately, I prepared

58
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
some useless clothes.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Even if I enter the palace,

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm not afraid of showing up.

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm not good at doing things.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Please forgive me.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will go outside

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
and find more flowers.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,560
No need.

66
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,680
Go back to the palace.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Yes.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
I will go now.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
It's a success.

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Wait until the guards on the street at night are loose.

71
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
We will find a way to get closer to the Eastern Palace

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
and pick up the people at any time.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Stop.

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,360
Commander Zheng,

75
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
His Highness ordered that

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
anyone who enters or leaves the Eastern Palace

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
must be checked carefully.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Have you checked enough?

80
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
Excuse me, Miss Jiang.

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,360
Isn't this the place

82
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,040
where Master disappeared last?

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,520
Stop.

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,920
Ma Dong.

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,520
You don't need to follow me.

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Yes.

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
I can't gather any spiritual power.

88
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
The formation in the palace

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
is more powerful than I thought.

90
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,880
No wonder Master is trapped.

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,920
Why are you still here?

92
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,920
Did you get

93
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,240
killed by Fu Gui?

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm not dead.

95
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
This man is actually

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
an enemy of the palace.

97
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
It's better to be a little more than a little more.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
What's wrong with you?

99
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
Why do you have to stay in the palace?

100
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Didn't you remember

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
the last time you were attacked?

102
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,920
The whole factory is full of people.

103
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,640
The Crown Prince can't protect you at all.

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
You can only die if you stay in the palace.

105
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
If there is no place to rest,

106
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,760
my father has a villa in the northwest.

107
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
You can go there and rest.

108
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,480
He's caring about me.

109
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,000
Is he someone I knew in my previous life?

110
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,080
He doesn't look mean.

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,360
Why don't you just break through him?

112
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Su Yishui was caught in the Eastern Palace.

113
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Do you know that?

114
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,200
Su Yishui was caught?

115
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,800
He made the noise

116
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,040
in the palace.

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
But that's not good.

118
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,640
A man like Su Yishui

119
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
who is ungrateful

120
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
is not important to you.

121
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,080
It's more serious

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
if you leave this place.

123
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,120
He doesn't know anything

124
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
and he has a deep misunderstanding of you.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
It seems that he won't help you.

126
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Master.

127
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,360
Greetings, Master.

128
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
Lady Zhou.

129
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
Why are you here?

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,560
The Prime Minister is waiting outside your palace.

131
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
I told you

132
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
to think about it.

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
What's this?

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,520
Master.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
Zhou Meiren's father, Zhou Xiang,

136
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
has been having a hard time with the Crown Prince.

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
He's going to lose favor.

138
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,360
So he came here

139
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
to show his kindness.

140
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,640
Don't let him fool you

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
or you'll be implicated.

142
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Get lost.

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Master.

144
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Master.

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
What's the meaning of

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,240
the friendship between the Immortal Lord and the Immortal Lord?

147
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,040
Don't worry.

148
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
After the Immortal Master of the Yiren Hall

149
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,120
re-examined it,

150
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,200
he's been very honest now.

151
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
He didn't show any signs of water.

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
The weak spiritual power

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
seems to be the master.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
Lady Zhou, please wait.

155
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,240
The temple is a forbidden place.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
His Highness ordered

157
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,720
that no one should come near.

158
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
I know.

159
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,360
I just heard that

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
there's something strange about the temple.

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,600
How is it?

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
It's not a place for the Immortal Lord

163
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,520
to be in.

164
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
It's a place for the Immortal Lord

165
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,320
to be in.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
It's a place for the Immortal Lord

167
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
to be in.

168
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
How is it?

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
It's just that an assassin

170
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,320
fell down.

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,200
His body hasn't been found yet.

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
The smell of the water

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
was indeed the master's.

174
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
The sound of the master

175
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
seemed to be very painful.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
He's in danger.

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
Lady Zhou, please leave.

178
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
I wonder how Master is doing.

179
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
I need to help him get out of the water as soon as possible.

180
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
But the guards here are strict.

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,640
The immortals of the Art Gallery

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
are no longer carrying the token.

183
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
How can they enter the water

184
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
without knowing it?

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Master.

186
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Master.

187
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,440
Didn't I tell you to go back?

188
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,680
Why are you still attacking?

189
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,080
You're in danger.

190
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
How can we leave without any worries?

191
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Don't worry.

192
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,440
I sneaked in.

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,640
I didn't expose myself.

194
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,360
Why are you using the Soul-guarding Spell again?

195
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,560
What happened?

196
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Are you hurt?

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,480
Why are you so stubborn?

198
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Do I need to save you?

199
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't have any worries about my life.

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Everything is within my plan.

201
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
You should go back.

202
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,200
But I clearly saw them

203
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
pushing you into the pool.

204
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,120
Now they're making excuses.

205
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
If you have any plans,

206
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
I can help you.

207
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,880
Do I have to report to you about my situation?

208
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Don't I make it clear enough?

209
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,880
We're no longer related.

210
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,640
Who told you to be so self-willed?

211
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,640
I now officially announce

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,680
to expel you from the West Mountain.

213
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,400
We'll never meet again.

214
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Leave now.

215
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,640
Only Master can expel his disciple.

216
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,440
How can he do that?

217
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
What did you say?

218
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,240
The disciple Su Yin Shui

219
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
is the one who killed you.

220
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,600
How can you talk to your master?

221
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Show me your true self.

222
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Qing...

223
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Qingge...

224
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
You finally admit

225
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,640
that I'm Mu Qingge.

226
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
You...

227
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
When did you regain your memories?

228
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
You should remember the past.

229
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,800
Who hurt you and harmed you?

230
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I haven't fully remembered the past.

231
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,800
But when I saw the portrait you made in the study,

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
you asked Master Zeng about it.

233
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,400
You treated Master as your disciple.

234
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
You were so devoted to him.

235
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
If the world knows about it,

236
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
they'll be shocked.

237
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
You hid me from everyone.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
You also kept me in the dark.

239
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Didn't you say

240
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
that your favorite person is Mu Qingge?

241
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I am Mu Qingge.

242
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Why did you hide from me?

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
You didn't dare to say anything.

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
I think I know the answer

245
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
to the question you can't answer.

246
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Just like what I saw in your mind.

247
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
For the past 19 years,

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
you've been living in the past.

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
You've been blaming yourself

250
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
for your guilt

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
and also for our betrayal.

252
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,400
But you forgot

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,200
that you were the one who helped me to be reborn.

254
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
You were the one who took care of me with your soul.

255
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
You destroyed the skills

256
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
and helped me to be reborn.

257
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
You were also the one.

258
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Even if you've done something wrong,

259
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
you've tried your best

260
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
to make up for it.

261
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
It's not enough.

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
My guilt for you

263
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,000
is not enough to make up for it.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
I know what I should do.

265
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,600
We'll talk about the past in the future.

266
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
Now, the important thing is

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
to tell me how to help you.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
No.

269
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm fine.

270
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
But I'm busy.

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
I can't leave the palace.

272
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Besides, I'm also not in danger.

273
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
You go back to the West Mountain.

274
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll come to you after I'm done.

275
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
You're lying again!

276
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
You wanted to hide from me

277
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
to go to the Fengyin Lingquan alone.

278
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
But you fell into the flower's mirror because of me.

279
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,840
You said that Mu Qingge

280
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
should not ignore your will

281
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
and put down your guilt.

282
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,200
But you did all this behind my back.

283
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,160
You left me with pain and lived through the rest of my life.

284
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Don't you hate me?

285
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
If you could remember everything,

286
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
you wouldn't think like that.

287
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
You don't remember anything now.

288
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,680
You don't have the right to forgive me.

289
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,320
Then how should we calculate it?

290
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
We'll talk about it when the time comes.

291
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
I am me,

292
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,720
but I am not me.

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,960
I am not me.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
I have lived through the past for 19 years.

295
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
I am not a fool.

296
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,720
Why do I keep getting trapped in the past?

297
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,760
I asked Liang Wumeng.

298
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
There is a way to return the soul

299
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
to the Heavens on the Taoism.

300
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,880
Let's work together.

301
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
At least we can create a future.

302
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,120
You won't even have the courage

303
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
to wait for me to recover my memory, right?

304
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,200
You even said that you would let me judge

305
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
and let me deal with it.

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
Could it be that it's all fake?

307
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,200
But...

308
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,280
I am your teacher.

309
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,440
I am your teacher.

310
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,600
Listen to me.

311
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Tell me how you are going to act now.

312
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,640
I will help you.

313
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
I am here to help you.

314
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,320
Teacher.

315
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,240
Why did you leave before I finished?

316
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,360
Is it because the Soul-guarding Spell

317
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,720
is too powerful?

318
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,800
I have to go and check

319
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,360
the water as soon as possible.

320
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
Your Highness.

321
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
Your Highness.

322
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,480
Where are you?

323
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,920
It's great that this place

324
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,840
is not affected by the Eastern Palace's formation.

325
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,960
You can all leave.

326
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
I am a little tired.

327
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,760
I don't want to be disturbed.

328
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,360
Let's clean up tomorrow.

329
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,800
Yes.

330
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,360
It's just right to

331
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,440
make a tree here.

332
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,680
Tree.

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Whether we can break the Eastern Palace's formation

334
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,600
is up to you.

335
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,720
The study is indeed heavily guarded.

336
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,000
The formation is also stronger.

337
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,280
It's a shame to see

338
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,720
the Crown Prince so often.

339
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,680
It's a shame to see

340
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,200
the Crown Prince so often.

341
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,200
Hurry up.

342
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Hurry up.

343
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,120
What are you trying to prove?

344
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,720
While Zhou Feihua is still

345
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,480
in a state of impotence,

346
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,720
hurry up and get her on board.

347
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,360
Sir.

348
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
What if she is not discovered?

349
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
How is that possible?

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,960
I have already bought in her maid.

351
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Someone will come to the Crown Prince

352
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,200
and tell him

353
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
that Zhou Feihua wants to meet him.

354
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
Hurry up.

355
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
Hurry up.

356
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,360
Hurry up.

357
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Hurry up.

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Hurry up.

359
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Hurry up.

360
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Hurry up.

361
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Hurry up.

362
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Hurry up.

363
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Hurry up.

364
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Hurry up.

365
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Hurry up.

366
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
Hurry up.

367
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Hurry up.

368
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,920
Someone fell into the water today.

369
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,800
Did you see the bodies floating up?

370
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,480
Someone has been guarding the temple.

371
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,040
No one can get close to them.

372
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,000
We've been investigating for so long

373
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
but we still have no leads.

374
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,960
Maybe there's a monster in the water.

375
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,240
It's indeed a rumor.

376
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
This matter is of great importance.

377
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,560
If we don't investigate the water and the whereabouts,

378
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,120
it will be too much of a worry.

379
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
You go and keep an eye on it.

380
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Yes.

381
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,040
He's also a monster in the pond.

382
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Who are you?

383
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840
Don't be angry.

384
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
I'm just an ordinary maid.

385
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,840
I saw someone trying to harm you.

386
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,960
I was angry and angry.

387
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm here to inform you.

388
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,240
What's going on?

389
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,840
It's all Lin Ye Ting's doing.

390
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,040
It's too late.

391
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,240
If you don't believe me,

392
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,640
you can go back to the bedroom and check.

393
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
You don't have to waste time here.

394
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
No.

395
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,840
You have to go with me.

396
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,640
Or else, I'll call someone right now.

397
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,240
You believe me now, right?

398
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,840
The Crown Prince's men are coming soon.

399
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
You're right.

400
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,240
Don't panic.

401
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
If it isn't late,

402
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm here to notify you immediately.

403
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I have something important to tell you, Your Highness.

404
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
My affection for you iskam dosha.

405
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
Fry you up.

406
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,320
Rain is falling.

407
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,300
No

408
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,740
No

409
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,620
Just sliced

410
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,560
No

411
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,020
Don't worry

412
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Your Madame

413
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,520
'll pick a wedding counter

414
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,960
at the step of the someone

415
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,780
At that time

416
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,740
Prince and me

417
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,860
have been in an inf elk's mouth

418
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,020
a second time

419
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,060
Meiyuan

420
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,040
I've been in charge of the palace.

421
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,120
How could I not be impressed by you?

422
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,440
Who are you?

423
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,920
If you don't tell me the truth,

424
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,440
I'll really call someone.

425
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
I'm not a maid.

426
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,240
But I have no evil intentions.

427
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,320
Can you let me go

428
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
for the sake of saving your life?

429
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
Since you didn't do anything bad,

430
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,040
how dare you explain it to me?

431
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
If I can help you,

432
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll do my best.

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm Su Yishui's disciple.

434
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
I came here

435
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,440
to save my master who fell into the pond.

436
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,960
Su Yishui?

437
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
How could a person

438
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,320
who knows the truth

439
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,200
receive a disciple

440
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
who values friendship like you?

441
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
Maybe everyone has prejudice against my master.

442
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
But what I said is true.

443
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,840
The weather in the capital is strange.

444
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,840
There are strange things

445
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
that happen often.

446
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
After my master investigated,

447
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
he suspected that this was related to the Eastern Palace,

448
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,080
but he was trapped in the pond.

449
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
He must have been trapped

450
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,800
by the monster in the water.

451
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
I have to save him.

452
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,880
There are really monsters in the pond.

453
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,520
It's true.

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,640
Do you know anything?

455
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,840
A while ago,

456
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,120
a subordinate of my father

457
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,640
passed by the water area in the palace at night.

458
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,040
Then,

459
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,200
my father went to investigate the water area.

460
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,160
But there was no result.

461
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,200
He thought that the water area and the pond were connected.

462
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,040
So he asked the Crown Prince

463
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
to open the pond and investigate it together.

464
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,080
But he was refused by Yan Li.

465
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,200
Later, that subordinate

466
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
fell into the pond

467
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,960
because he was drunk.

468
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Someone must have killed someone

469
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,280
to cover up the secret.

470
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,160
The more people don't want to know,

471
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,360
the more dangerous it is.

472
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,040
I must go to the pond

473
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,160
to find out.

474
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,680
Is it worth it to take risks

475
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
for a person like Su Yishui?

476
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Everyone has a lot of misunderstandings about my master.

477
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
But I know

478
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
he is the best person in the world to me.

479
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,640
Now he is all alone,

480
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
without me.

481
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,440
Who else can save him except me?

482
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,280
He is all alone,

483
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,520
without me.

484
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Who else can save him

485
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
except me?

486
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
I didn't expect that

487
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,320
I've been working in the deep palace for more than ten years.

488
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,880
I've become a burden.

489
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
I was going to ask the pond

490
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
to find out.

491
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
But I can't be a second-rate

492
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,680
because you are Su Yishui's disciple.

493
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,480
Fine.

494
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,280
I can help you.

495
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,800
Guards!

496
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,720
There's an assassin!

497
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
Where is the assassin?

498
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,680
He went that way.

499
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,480
Search!

500
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:41,960
Hurry!

501
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,640
Go!

502
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,800
Wait!

503
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,720
Maybe I was wrong.

504
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,080
Don't make too much noise.

505
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,600
Don't disturb the Crown Prince.

506
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,440
Yes!

507
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes!

508
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Search!

509
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,600
Yes!

510
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,080
What's going on?

511
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,440
There's a lot of resentment in the water.

512
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
If the water is too cold,

513
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,240
the resentment will be absorbed by the resentment.

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
So the body of the water

515
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
is in the water all the time.

516
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
Isn't it dangerous?

517
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,000
Wait for me in the dark.

518
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,680
But...

519
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,520
To be honest,

520
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm the God of Fruit.

521
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
The resentment doesn't work on me.

522
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,160
I'll be back soon.

523
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,080
What?

524
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,680
Fruit?

525
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,360
There's so much resentment in the water.

526
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,320
Will Master be all right?

527
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,400
Ms. Mo,

528
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,640
Mr. Gu showed up instantly.

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:17,880
It's the remnant of Seven Brock

530
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,160
and pec Nak dell'Odine.

531
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,240
I'm not scared of dragons,

532
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
I was afraid that you may get hurt.

533
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,720
Master,

534
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:35,000
why did you use Soul-chain

535
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,720
and control this dragon?

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,660
It should have had the power of

537
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,720
GeneralOur raid

538
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,280
original threat sword

539
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,960
had an internal monoc tile

540
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,360
head hemispheres

541
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,440
I couldn't protect myself.

542
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,520
And it would be harder for me to save the dragonphone easily.

543
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,240
Which is the most Powerful part!

544
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Try to find a hidden thief!

545
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,760
I found something on Qinglong.

546
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,200
What is it?

547
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
A spell called Cr memnom again.

548
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,960
So I used it as a spell of marker of Dragon Control.

549
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,480
After very hard play,

550
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,880
when I was trying

551
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,280
to locate the Wind П идеص of Pingning,

552
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
he was stuffed with theled shadow.

553
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,080
As I remember,

554
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,640
that I've just jumped into the water,

555
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,200
but just fully percent흤 tried to break through the95% spring.

556
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I'm trying to get it out.

557
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I see.

558
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
It seems that all the key is on the dragon.

559
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
But why did Su Yu risk

560
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
to lock the dragon in the palace?

561
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Su Yu has a long life.

562
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
He raised the dragon to extend his life.

563
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
What?

564
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I only knew about it

565
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
after I was reborn.

566
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Su Yu has been poisoned

567
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
and has been dead.

568
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I guess he plans to use the Seven Sages to transform

569
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
the dragon into dragon.

570
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
He has a long life.

571
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
To extend his life,

572
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
he put the people of the imperial city

573
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
in danger.

574
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
We must save the dragon

575
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
and send it back to the dragon island.

576
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
That's what I mean.

577
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
But...

578
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Su Yu trapped us with the formation.

579
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I need more power to break the chain.

580
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
And the evolution power

581
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
will take six days.

582
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Chong Yang was the right time.

583
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I can use the formation

584
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
to collect the power

585
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
and send the dragon out of the formation.

586
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
And send it back to the dragon island.

587
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
But...

588
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Master, where is your body?

589
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Why I haven't seen it?

590
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
There are people with the qi in the water.

591
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I've hidden it in a safe place.

592
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't worry. Su Yu won't find it.

593
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Oh no.

594
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Someone used magic to stop

595
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
the connection between me and the body.

596
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I can't feel my body.

597
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
What?

598
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Su Yu can't find you anywhere

599
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
and force you to show up with this?

600
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
But if the Soul-guarding Spell

601
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
doesn't restore the connection in twelve hours,

602
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
you'll never be able to go back to the body.

603
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I have an idea.

604
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
I can feel it

605
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
if I put my body

606
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
near my body.

607
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Master, leave it to me.

608
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
The palace is too dangerous.

609
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
If he finds out your true identity,

610
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
he'll do everything to keep you.

611
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Don't worry.

612
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I have Zhou Feihua to help me.

613
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I won't let Su Yu find out.

614
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Besides, I've touched the formation

615
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
under the Eastern Palace.

616
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Maybe I can break the formation

617
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
and restore your power.

618
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You used to protect me.

619
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Now it's my turn to protect you.

620
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I can't do anything about it.

621
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Come on!

622
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
You're finally back!

623
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm so worried.

624
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Where's Su Yu?

625
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
or death.

626
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
Dragon Retreat

627
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,520
The dragon attack

628
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,360
on Unterwater

629
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,040
are wrestling to serve

630
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,200
the messages of the person.

631
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,000
That's right.

632
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,140
Once the dragon will change attack form

633
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,840
instead of their turns,

634
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,400
he'll enter our Tang.

635
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,640
Then we assume

636
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,860
he is chopped off

637
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,060
and we can keep going.

638
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
will be controlled by the power of the dragon.

639
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,560
It will lose its nature.

640
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,680
The consequences

641
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,080
can't be taken by the world.

642
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,720
I didn't expect

643
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
that a prince who is always a young and loving person

644
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
would become so stubborn.

645
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,800
Once a person's heart is controlled by obsession,

646
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
it's hard to tell if he's a good person or not.

647
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040
That's why I entered the palace.

648
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,400
It was because our Zhou family promised Qingge

649
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,080
to be the duke of the Qin State.

650
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,640
But

651
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
His Highness did such a thing.

652
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,080
I failed to fulfill my old friend's request.

653
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,640
I really feel sorry for Qingge.

654
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,040
You've been in the palace alone for so many years

655
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,360
for a promise.

656
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,440
You've been very good.

657
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,440
Besides,

658
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
you still have a chance to turn back.

659
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,400
After Master has purified the dragon's energy,

660
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,760
he will use it to control the dragon

661
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,720
and destroy the dragon island.

662
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
You don't have to blame yourself.

663
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,840
You're a little girl.

664
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
You're good at comforting people.

665
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,360
I don't know why,

666
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
but you and I

667
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,440
are indeed a good match.

668
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,240
Oh, no.

669
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,040
What's wrong?

670
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
The painting tally is broken in the water.

671
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,240
I can't move freely in the palace.

672
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,880
I need your help with something.

673
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,280
Put my personal belongings

674
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
near my body.

675
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,560
I thought it was something.

676
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,840
It's not difficult.

677
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,760
Tell me.

678
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,960
Where should I put it?

679
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,760
You're the only one who knows this place.

680
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,720
Don't let anyone else find out.

681
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
It's done.

682
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,640
Great.

683
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,120
Now Master can go back to his body.

684
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,960
Thank you.

685
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
But you helped us.

686
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,320
If Su Yu knows about it,

687
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
you'll be implicated.

688
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,520
Why don't you wait for the dragon

689
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,360
to leave the palace with me?

690
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,800
Leave the palace?

691
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,120
Do you like the Crown Prince?

692
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
He's not a man of the grass and wood.

693
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
He's always with me.

694
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,640
How can he be heartless?

695
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
It's just that

696
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,080
in his heart,

697
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,920
he only has Qingge.

698
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
I can't wait

699
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
for his reply.

700
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,560
If the dragon leaves,

701
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm afraid that

702
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,760
his life will be in vain.

703
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
He'll be with his wife and son for many years.

704
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,840
After he's done with this,

705
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,360
he'll think about the future.

706
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,320
The Crown Prince has arrived.

707
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,680
Report!

708
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
Why are you here all of a sudden?

709
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,640
Your Highness,

710
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

711
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
to let him in.

712
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
My men can't enter.

713
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
People outside the palace

714
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
can hide.

715
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,040
What do you mean?

716
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
I don't understand.

717
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,480
You're trying to trick me with another man.

718
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,560
Where is

719
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
your heart?

720
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,680
How dare you!

721
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,840
Ranran,

722
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,000
since you're here,

723
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
why are you hiding from me?

724
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,800
Or should I call you Qingge

725
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,440
so that you can recognize me?

726
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Qingge?

727
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,040
Wait! Don't hurt him!

728
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,880
How did you know I was here?

729
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,840
I not only knew,

730
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,640
but I also knew that you and Sui Shi

731
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,480
were going to let go of my dragon.

732
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,120
The Sound-Quan Talisman?

733
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,520
You eavesdropped on our conversation?

734
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
Sui's plan

735
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,680
was indeed good.

736
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,880
But

737
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,040
the Eastern Palace

738
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,400
is an isolated place.

739
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,720
The water is too strong.

740
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
Sui's body

741
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,000
won't be hidden in the water.

742
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,160
I'm sure

743
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,080
he's already used magic

744
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,200
to return to the shore.

745
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,600
But we can't find him.

746
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
Then we'll have to wait.

747
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,960
If he can let go of the dragon,

748
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600
then we'll be able to

749
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
find both the human and the dragon.

750
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,280
Don't worry.

751
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,800
I can't find him,

752
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,600
but I can cut off

753
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,040
his connection with the flesh.

754
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,680
Within twelve hours,

755
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,040
he'll surely ask someone to help

756
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
to put his body

757
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
within ten steps of the flesh.

758
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,680
His disciple

759
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,280
knows that he's in danger.

760
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,920
He won't just stand there.

761
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Shen Shen?

762
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
I'll search everywhere in the palace

763
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,040
to hide the Cheting Wind Bell.

764
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,360
I won't be able to find him.

765
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,400
Good.

766
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,640
Is it done?

767
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,640
Yes.

768
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Now Master can

769
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,760
return to his body.

770
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,640
Thank you.

771
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,120
Zhou Fei Hua.

772
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,240
How is it?

773
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,160
Nothing.

774
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,960
No.

775
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,240
Nothing?

776
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,720
Let's go.

777
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,200
Have you found him?

778
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,640
Your Highness,

779
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
we've searched everywhere.

780
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,240
We didn't find Su Yi Shui.

781
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,840
Impossible.

782
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,200
Could it be that he's

783
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,560
secretly gone to other places?

784
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,120
Today, every where of the Cheting Wind Bell

785
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,480
is under our control.

786
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm sure that

787
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
we've searched

788
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
everywhere he's been.

789
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,760
Su Yi Shui can't be hidden.

790
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,840
That's strange.

791
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,240
The Chou Mei Ren must have

792
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,320
put his body

793
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,000
near Su Yi Shui's flesh

794
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,800
to find him.

795
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
But we've searched everywhere

796
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,400
he's been,

797
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,640
but we didn't find Su Yi Shui.

798
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,520
Could it be that...

799
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,360
No.

800
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,680
There's one more place

801
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,600
that we haven't searched.

802
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,080
My study.

803
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Can you please

804
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,400
open a modal dose village Yasenしめる?

805
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Yes.

806
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,640
Why?

807
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,200
Why you're so worried about her?

808
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,080
Because the Inheritance of Immortality

809
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,960
is used for physical and spiritual captures.

810
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,600
It can't be used for other purposes.

811
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,960
Since you've brought that medicine,

812
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,880
it won't help us.

813
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
I've called that escuch- implant oflifting

814
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,640
were shouldered by Suado.

815
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
It'satory about letters.

816
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,320
I have to.

817
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,120
No, no, no.

818
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,400
Please.

819
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Yes.

820
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,040
Go!

821
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
You dare to play such a trick?

822
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
If you dare to touch my master's body,

823
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
I'll kill you.

824
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
I'll kill you.

825
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,920
Don't worry.

826
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
I can't bear to destroy this body.

827
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,200
What do you mean?

828
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
What are you going to do?

829
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,400
Although the dragon lives for a long time,

830
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,720
it's not human after all.

831
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,280
Why don't I have Su Yishui's body

832
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,600
in my hand?

833
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,720
You...

834
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,720
You want to take the snake?

835
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,720
I thought you were a kind and kind person.

836
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,680
But you used living people as a trap

837
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,280
to keep your life.

838
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,280
Now you even use evil to take the snake.

839
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
Do you really deserve

840
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,840
to be treated by those people who love you

841
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,520
and your heart?

842
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,720
How can I be treated?

843
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,400
I've done so many things for the people.

844
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,240
I've done so much for the court.

845
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,000
Now I'm dying.

846
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Why can't I let them

847
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,320
pay for my sins?

848
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,120
As long as I live,

849
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,000
and get to the throne,

850
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,080
I'll be a good emperor.

851
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,200
Then I'll be able to

852
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
live for a thousand generations

853
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,400
and benefit more people.

854
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,600
Isn't that better?

855
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,080
Do you really think

856
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,720
you'll be the kind and kind king

857
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,200
after you take this evil path?

858
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,200
Do the people in the world

859
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
really need a man like you?

860
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
You haven't changed at all.

861
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,280
Even if you look younger,

862
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,080
you still won't say anything against your heart.

863
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,800
But it's not your fault.

864
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,880
You've forgotten the past.

865
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
You're just a young girl

866
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
who's just 19 years old.

867
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,320
You don't understand.

868
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,400
A man who does great things

869
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,360
shouldn't be a thief.

870
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,800
You're a man who gets to the throne

871
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,280
and becomes a successful man.

872
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,000
Who's hurt?

873
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,520
You haven't been infected with blood!

874
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,640
I really misjudged you.

875
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,520
Misjudged me?

876
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,280
You think your master, Su Yishui,

877
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,600
is a noble man?

878
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,720
You don't remember?

879
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,240
Then let me tell you.

880
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,880
Su Yishui

881
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,960
is the son of the Demon Lord of the Ten Thousand Evil Hands.

882
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,160
He

883
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,080
is the one who threatens the people!

884
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,920
The one who threatens the people

885
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,640
is always the human heart.

886
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,400
He's born to be a demon son.

887
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,560
He's controlled by the people he loves.

888
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,360
But now,

889
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
you're taking the initiative to do these evil things.

890
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,040
You're not surprised at all.

891
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
You knew Su Yishui was a demon son.

892
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,000
That's right.

893
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,840
I know who he is.

894
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,200
I also know who I am.

895
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't remember clearly what happened before.

896
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,240
But I know who I am.

897
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
I knew he was a good man.

898
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,200
That's why I tried my best

899
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,400
to help him get rid of the spiritual power

900
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,760
and bring him back to the right path.

901
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,080
Likewise,

902
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,400
I knew you were a good man.

903
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,200
That's why I chose to help you and King of the Immortal.

904
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,240
But I was wrong.

905
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,920
You know you're a mother.

906
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,800
You should know that Su Yishui

907
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,960
was the one who killed you.

908
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
But why don't you hate him at all?

909
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Because he used half of the golden elixir to destroy the evil

910
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,520
to bring you back to life.

911
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
You can forgive him for everything.

912
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I only know that

913
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,880
he treats me very well now.

914
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,880
And he's doing everything he can to seal the spiritual power.

915
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,160
He's being a good person with confidence.

916
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,960
Isn't it worth forgiving

917
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
a person who really destroyed the evil?

918
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
Destroyed the evil?

919
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,000
Yes.

920
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,840
You can forgive a person who destroyed the evil.

921
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,920
Destroyed the evil?

922
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,960
You can do it all over again?

923
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,720
Then I have to destroy it too.

924
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,360
I regret that you came to me first.

925
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,080
But I let you save that cruel second brother.

926
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,800
If it weren't for that,

927
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,320
I wouldn't have pushed you to Su Yishui.

928
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,520
But in the end,

929
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,000
what did I get?

930
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,560
I got the poison that my second brother sent secretly.

931
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,800
I got

932
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,920
the position of crown prince.

933
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,600
It's for my body that's not as good as it's dead.

934
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,200
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
I'm sorry.

941
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
