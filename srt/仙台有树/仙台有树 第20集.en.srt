Don't leave me behind.

If I'm alone,

9
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,350
I'd rather die!

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,920
It's all my fault.

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200

but Mr. Liu's obsession runs too deep.

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
He doesn't want to live on in disgrace.

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
He has harmed so many people.

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,610
He deserves his punishment.

21
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,750
If the evil being hadn't influenced him,

22
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,480
things might not have turned out this way.

who had reached the Transcendence Realm

25

couldn't avoid being affected by the Spirit Spring.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,150
We still need to quickly find a way

27

I have no way to repay you.

Ranran,

46
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,620
you haven't touched it yet, have you?

47
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,800
There's no need.

48
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,120
It doesn't matter what the Heavenly Book says.

49
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
One's fate belongs to oneself.

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
In the end, we must walk our own path.

51
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I won't look at it.

Our business here is finished.

53
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,240
Once we've rested and regrouped,

54

If you're unwell,

77
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,870
then you should return to the capital

78

with me even more.

79
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,040

I can ensure that you're healthy and worry-free.

82
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,920
Mr. Yu, there's no need to worry.

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,190
It's just that my heart is unstable.

84
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,120
If I cultivate well

85
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,830
and form my Golden Core, everything will be fine.

86
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,030
An unstable heart...

Ranran fell from

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,690
Could this be the reason why

90
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,190
Su Yishui insisted on bringing Ranran

91
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,850
to cultivate in Mount Wester?

92
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,310
Su Yishui said that after you form your Golden Core,

93
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,710
everything will be fine?

94
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,630
After I gain more experience,

95
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,990
I should be able to build my Foundation.

96
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,390
Then the Golden Core stage won't be far off.

97
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,390
How can I let you stay by his side

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,070

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,920
it will be the once-every-19-years

Marrow-Cleansing Pool?

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,190
Yes.

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,180
Hundreds of years ago,

106
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,000
a great savior

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,020
chanced upon a pool of spiritual power

108
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,510
on Heavenly Meridian Mountain.

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,070
Bathing in it could transform one's body,

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,270
greatly increasing spiritual power.

111
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,190
So after he attained ascension,

112
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,510
he specially opened up this place,

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,950
naming it the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,260
He left it as a blessed land

115
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
for future cultivators.

116
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,360
But this Marrow-Cleansing Pool

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,820
opens once every 19 years.

118
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,750
Among all Heavenly Sect disciples,

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,870
only those who compete

120
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,000
and take first place

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,830
will have the chance

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,120
to enter the pool and cleanse their marrow.

123
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,050
So you're saying

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,340
if I win the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Trial,

125
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,870
my spiritual power can advance?

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,310
Yes.

127
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,190
Then you'll be able to form your Golden Core, finish your training,

128
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,320

to control the power of nine sacred relics,

175
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,830
It's unwise to take any more risks.

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
This was all her idea.

178
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,640
If you want to settle scores, do it with her!

179
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Su Yishui,

180
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
don't be so arrogant.

181
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,000
Resentment Liquid!

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,440
You—

183
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,440
Yes.

184
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,690
I've been secretly controlling

185
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,690
the Resentment Liquid in your body.

186
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,030
If you had behaved yourself,

187
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,000
I wouldn't have touched the Resentment Liquid.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
You brought this upon yourself.

189
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,240
I was wrong.

190
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,690
I was wrong, Su Yishui.

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,290
I won't dare to do this again.

192
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,780
For Qingge's sake,

193
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,150
please forgive me.

194
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,390
In your previous life, your sister

195
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,410
catered to your every whim,

196
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,960
protected, and indulged you.

197
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
But I'm not her.

198
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
I won't be soft-hearted.

199
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,150
Although I can't kill you,

200
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,000
I have countless ways

201
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,690
to make you wish you were dead.

202
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Su Yishui.

203
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,120
I know

204
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,050
you are the real Demon's child.

205
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,280
In the previous life,

206
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,980
Qingge took the blame for you.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
If you don't stop now,

208
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,470
I'll reveal this secret to the world.

209
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,810
You think I care

210
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,700
if others know?

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,940
You're not afraid of this,

212
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,690
but don't you care about Xue Ranran?

213
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,240
I already found out.

214
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,490
Your disciple, Xue Ranran,

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
is my sister,

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,750
Mu Qingge,

217
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,440
right?

218
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,510
You don't care if the Heavenly Sects find out

219
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,350
about your identity as the Demon's child and seek revenge,

220
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,950
but Xue Ranran is different.

221
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,030
She's your disciple now

222
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,720
and has little spiritual power.

223
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,620
When the time comes,

224
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,750
she will surely become the target of everyone's attacks,

225
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,550
never knowing peace in her life.

226
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,720
If at that time,

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,150
you're also in deep trouble,

228
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,750
will you still be able to protect her?

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,020
Su Yishui,

230
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,570
neutralize my Resentment Liquid immediately

231
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,570
or I'll draw my sword and end my life.

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,870
Qingge and I are connected by the Soul-Devouring Lock.

233
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,510
If I die,

234
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,600
she dies too.

235
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,250
With her going down with me,

236
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,670
it'll be worth it.

237
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,890
If I can make the Reincarnation Tree bear fruit once,

238
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,220
I can do it a second time.

239
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,270
But you won't have

240
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,080
another chance to come back to life.

241
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,010
Go ahead and try.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Making the Reincarnation Tree bear fruit once

243
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,980
requires you to use up half a Golden Core.

244
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,600
Do you still have enough Golden Cores

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,270
to spare?

246
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,920
What's wrong?

247
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,770
Did I guess correctly?

248
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,130
Wanting to resurrect my sister

249
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,090
isn't that easy,

250
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
right, Su Yishui?

251
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
I can neutralize the Resentment Liquid.

252
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,870
But I want you to make a soul oath.

253
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,320
You must not reveal Ranran's and my identities

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,180
to anyone else.

255
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,920
Play your role as Mu Qingge well.

256
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,620
If you break this oath,

257
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,000
may heavenly lightning strike you down

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and your soul be forever destroyed.

259
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,400
How dare you make me swear such a vicious oath!

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
Before that drop of dew hits the ground,

261
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,230
you still have a chance to make the oath.

262
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
Otherwise, I'll kill you first.

263
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,320
At worst, I can give up the remaining half

264
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,520
of my Golden Core too!

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,790
I swear!

266
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,030
I will never reveal

267
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,550
Xue Ranran's and your identities.

268
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,870
If I do, may heavenly lightning strike me down

269
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,730
and my soul be forever destroyed.

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,670
Su Yishui,

271
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
you madman!

272
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,200
To neutralize the Resentment Liquid,

273
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,660
follow me to Mount Wester.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,020
Your Highness.

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,579
I've brought the wound medicine.

276
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
You're wounded too.

277
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Let's tend to your wounds first.

278
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,980
Su Yishui almost seriously injured you,

279
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,560
and now he's disappeared

280
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,000
without an explanation.

281
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
The way he was just now...

282
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,580
Never mind.

283
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,830
I think you should

284
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,720
leave with me.

285
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,680
Master must have discovered something,

286
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,310
so...

287
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,480
He won't abandon us.

288
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,790
Mr. Yu.

289
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,970
Your Highness,

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
the army has urgent matters

291
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,060
that can't be delayed any longer.

292
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,830
Ranran,

293
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,790
since you're still unwilling

294
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,190
to come with me this time,

295
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,160
I won't force you.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,200
After you form your Golden Core and complete your training,

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,530
we'll discuss it again.

298
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,200
I must leave today.

299
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,040
Take good care of yourself.

300
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
Mr. Yu.

301
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,830
Take care.

302
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,500
Your Highness.

303
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,300
Your Highness.

304
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,890
Your Highness,

305
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,480
we were delayed here

306
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,440
for too long.

307
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
The pills left by the Exotic Pavilion

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
have all been used up.

309
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm afraid the poison in your body

310
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,560
can no longer be suppressed.

311
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't make a fuss about it.

312
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,240
Return to the capital immediately.

313
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,720
Yes.

314
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,070
Your Highness,

315
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,400
there's one more thing.

316
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,540
The collapsed waterway here

317
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,340
has unexpectedly been cleared.

318
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,110
Excellent.

319
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,550
I can't wait anymore.

320
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,150
Let's depart.

321
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,800
Could Master

322
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,290
be in some kind of trouble?

323
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,070
Senior,

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,590
take good care of Xi'er.

325
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,050
I'll go out and have a look.

326
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,880
Alright.

327
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,480
Master,

328
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,030
Master!

329
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,170
Are you alright?

330
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,350
Long time no see, Xue Ranran.

331
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,200
Master Mu.

332
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,690
I happened to be passing by.

333
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,730
I sensed that Shui was nearby,

334
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,250
so I came to check on him.

335
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,070
Master, you suddenly left just now.

336
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,730
Was it to look for Master Mu?

337
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I have stabilized Xi'er's primordial spirit.

338
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,000
She still needs to take medication and rest for several days

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,720
to recover.

340
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,950
Let's return to Mount Wester first.

341
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes, Master.

342
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,510
What about Master Mu?

343
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,050
I'll go with you all.

344
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,160
Mr. Yu just left.

345
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,110
Won't you go catch up with him?

346
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,270
I naturally want to spend more time

347
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,000
with Shui.

348
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,270
Master!

349
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
You didn't look

350
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,260
very well earlier.

351
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,920
Were you affected by the Spirit Spring?

352
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,000
Master!

353
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,190
This matter doesn't concern you.

354
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,410
I can handle it myself.

355
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,070
Don't ask any more questions.

356
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,400
You,

357
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,880
come with me.

358
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,110
Can't Grandmaster

359
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,350
fly by herself?

360
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,030
Ranran,

361
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,690
then I'll take Xi'er away first.

362
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,950
Be careful on your own.

363
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,240
Who on earth wanted to

364
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,100
set up a formation here to kill us?

365
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,030
The Alcohol Immortal is proficient in rune cultivation.

366
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,230
Perhaps he can help find out something.

367
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,370
-Master.
-Guardian.

368
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,400
Clean up the room

369
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,130
next to mine.

370
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,360
Master Mu will be staying at Mount Wester for a few days.

371
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

372
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,640
Bring the high-quality

373
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,070
soul-transferring pills from the alchemy hall.

374
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,600
Help Xi'er take them daily.

375
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,830
Yes, Master.

376
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,460
Follow me.

377
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,960
You were in such a hurry to pull me away earlier.

378
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
Were you worried that I might accidentally

379
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
say something wrong?

380
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,640
Keep your mouth shut.

381
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,230
I can keep my mouth shut,

382
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,680
but can you control your heart?

383
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,720
You're so guarded against me.

384
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,580
What's the use?

385
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,100
I saw everything earlier.

386
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,480
You lost control

387
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,390
and almost killed Qingge.

388
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,940
You are the Demon's child,

389
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,940
and now, you're carrying the Spirit Spring.

390
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,920
Could it be

391
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,200
that you're being influenced

392
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,000
by the evil Spirit Spring again?

393
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,550
But it's still several years

394
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,680
before the netherworld's gate opens.

395
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,030
As long as this Spirit Spring can't be returned

396
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,470
and stays with you,

397
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
who knows when

398
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,020
you might lose control again

399
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,960
and kill Qingge?

400
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,220
How is Xi'er doing?

401
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,350
I must catch

402
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,300
the one who set up the trap to harm us

403
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,860
and get revenge for Xi'er.

404
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,870
If it can be implanted from the outside into the heart,

405
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
then there must be a way to remove it.

406
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,270
Why isn't it working?

407
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,310
Why?

408
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:26,200
[Carefree Pavilion]

409
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,310
Mr. Yu Chen,

410
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,370
is Master here?

411
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,010
The Guardian is not here.

412
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,920
Yesterday, the Guardian instructed me

413
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,770
to tidy up the alchemy hall.

414
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,830
He said he would prepare it for Mu Ran—

415
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,610
Mu Qingge for alchemy today.

416
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,520
He probably

417
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,820
went to the alchemy hall early to start the furnace.

418
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Master actually

419
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,890
went to start the furnace himself.

420
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,540
She's about to build her Foundation.

421
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,920
If she advances,

422
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,000
won't my spiritual power

423
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,110
be drained and decrease

424
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,680
again?

425
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,320
I can't let her succeed.

426
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,550
Before advancing,

427
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,420
one's true energy is unstable.

428
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,750
It's the easiest to go astray at this time.

429
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,200
I can't attack her,

430
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,080
but if

431
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,910
her own true energy goes haywire

432
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,490
and something goes wrong,

433
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,910
then it can't be blamed on me.

434
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,110
Ranran.

435
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,960
Master Mu.

436
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,920
Bringing snacks to Shui?

437
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,410
There's no need.

438
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,960
His mind is all on me.

439
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,750
He'll be refining pills for me in the coming days.

440
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,810
He has no time for irrelevant people.

441
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,920
You came here early in the morning

442
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,980
just to brag about these things to me?

443
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,560
Alright.

444
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,590
I got it.

445
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,830
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

446
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,070
Did I expose

447
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,510
those unspeakable thoughts

448
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,270
of yours?

449
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,070
Let me remind you,

450
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,240
don't forget your place.

451
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,750
Don't go coveting

452
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,040
those you shouldn't.

453
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,830
In his eyes,

454
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,070
you're just a disciple he took in

455
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,070
to pass his idle time.

456
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,720
When he's happy,

457
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,070
he'll dote on you.

458
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,650
When he's bored,

459
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,740
he'll discard you.

460
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
Don't ever

461
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,210
take yourself too seriously.

462
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,790
Then tell me,

463
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,210
people say Mu Qingge

464
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,370
is obsessed with me.

465
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,830
Is that true?

466
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,440
Don't think I don't know

467
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
what you're up to.

468
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,270
If you can't let go of your delusions,

469
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,480
I'll give you a hand.

470
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
You saved Qingge and gave her a second life.

471
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,660
Do you want to repeat the same mistakes?

472
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,640
Master?

473
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Why were you so careless?

474
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,030
You didn't even notice

475
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,550
that you're about to build your Foundation?

476
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,350
Master,

477
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,050
I...

478
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,650
Focus your mind,

479
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
close off your five senses,

480
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,030
eliminate distracting thoughts,

481
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,490
and channel your energy to build your heart.

482
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,080
The lightning tribulation has come.

483
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,160
I just wanted to

484
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
savor every moment

485
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
with you before sealing the Spirit Spring.

486
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,400
Even if the Ice Lotus Technique hurt me,

487
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,070
so what?

488
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,880
But now I realize

489
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,510
that the drop of Spirit Spring in my heart

490
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,040
wasn't completely erased.

491
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,750
I won't allow myself

492
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,150
to get close to you again.

493
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,800
I've fallen from the Nascent Soul stage.

494
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Mu Qingge,

495
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,130
were you born

496
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,350
to oppose me?

497
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,940
I'll make sure you won't have it easy.

498
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
That was the Spirit Spring just now.

499
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,580
Ling Xiao.

500
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,960
Could you be the Demon's child?

501
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,530
You still don't remember?

502
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,710
No,

503
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,360
I need to see clearly who you really are.

504
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,510
What is this place?

505
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,320
This is me from my past life?

506
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,790
Ling Xiao.

507
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,270
Ling Xiao?

508
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:55,960
No,

509
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,940
these are my memories.

510
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,440
Could it be that I've reached the Foundation Phase

511
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,510
and my spiritual power has increased,

512
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,640
unlocking memories from my past life?

513
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,160
I've moved from Ling Xiao's memories

514
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,590
into

515
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,790
my own memories.

516
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,690
I never thought

517
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,420
you'd venture into the netherworld.

518
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,560
Ling Xiao,

519
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
I've also entered the netherworld.

520
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,550
What was I doing in the netherworld?

521
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,000
Could my past life be connected to the Spirit Spring?

522
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,639
What exactly is our connection?

523
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,040
Ling Xiao,

524
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,360
see if you can

525
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,760
remember anything else.

526
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,110
Why is everything so different

527
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,310
from what I imagined?

528
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,280
Who am I really?

529
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
And who are you?

530
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,320
This time,

531
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,230
we miscalculated a bit.

532
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,930
Su Yishui

533
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,420
found the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring,

534
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,670
but it didn't go as we planned.

535
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,110
He wasn't possessed by the Spirit Spring again.

536
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,760
However,

537
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,510
as long as he still has

538
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,590
that drop of Spirit Spring in his heart,

539
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,120
everything can be managed.

540
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,320
I have another plan.

541
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I know

542
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,010
it's hard for you to accept it too.

543
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,670
If you really are the Demon's child,

544
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,960
yet you were deeply entangled with my past life

545
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,690
and even split your spiritual soul to protect me,

546
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,450
it's indeed quite complicated to process.

547
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,430
No wonder Master was reluctant

548
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,030
to tell me about my past life.

549
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,800
You say you won't look for your soul owner anymore

550
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,000
and you won't go back?

551
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
That won't do.

552
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Ling Xiao,

553
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,630
regardless of whether your soul owner is the Demon's child

554
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,480
or whatever else,

555
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,810
you are still my friend.

556
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,920
Your kindness in protecting me all this way still stands.

557
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,050
I will send you back.

558
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,590
Besides,

559
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,920
the Demon's child is just a regular person born

560
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,720
at a special time, nothing more.

561
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,000
Right or wrong, good or evil,

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,530
I can discern it for myself.

563
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,070
Moreover,

564
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,610
I need to advance faster now.

565
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,630
This way,

566
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
I can find out

567
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,570
how I entered the netherworld before

568
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,300
and help Master return the Spirit Spring as soon as possible.

569
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,600
The fastest way to advance...

570
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,080
It opens once every 19 years.

571
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,000
Among all Heavenly Sect disciples,

572
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,070
only those who compete

573
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,200
and take first place

574
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,150
will have the chance

575
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,550
to enter the pool and cleanse their marrow.

576
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,170
Ranran.

577
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,360
Mr. Zeng.

578
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,000
Ranran,

579
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,480
congratulations on

580
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,280
successfully building your Foundation.

581
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,230
Mr. Zeng, you've come to congratulate me so quickly.

582
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,670
Since you've successfully built your Foundation,

583
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,710
you should have

584
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,770
a suitable weapon.

585
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,190
The sword you used

586
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,400
to defeat the Nine-Headed Kui'ao last time

587
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,480
was indeed a divine weapon.

588
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,920
That sword also acknowledges you.

589
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,450
That's Mu Qingge's Qingming Sword, isn't it?

590
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,750
I've already given the sword to Master for safekeeping.

591
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,610
Master must cherish it very much.

592
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,920
This sword has an owner.

593
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,780
I don't want it.

594
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,760
Alright,

595
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,690
that's fine.

596
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,190
I will custom-make

597
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,320
a better one for you.

598
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,710
Thank you, Mr. Zeng.

599
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,840
You're so kind to me.

600
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,680
However,

601
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,440
I already

602
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,710
have my own weapon.

603
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,670
I want to call it

604
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,690
Divine Tree.

605
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,760
Someone once told me

606
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,560
that planting a tree somewhere

607
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,270
means you have a home there.

608
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,770
Mount Wester will be your home from now on.

609
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,440
You are no longer

610
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,400
homeless.

611
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,340
This Reincarnation Tree shares your life force.

612
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,320
If you forge it into a weapon,

613
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,070
there won't be anything

614
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,330
more suitable for you.

615
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,280
With your Formless Spirit Root,

616
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,030
you should be able to make it transform more freely at will.

617
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,510
With my current spiritual power,

618
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,110
it's probably not possible.

619
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,720
However,

620
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,750
if I use spirit pills to supplement my power...

621
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,060
Brilliant!

622
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,700
Perhaps different spirit pills

623
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,960
can give it different transformations.

624
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,620
I'll try it next time.

625
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,090
[Consonance Palace]

626
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,500
Stiffly Su.

627
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,400
What's going on with you?

628
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,030
I couldn't stop you

629
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,150
from falling in love before.

630
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,610
Why the sudden change now?

631
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
It's nothing.

632
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,190
I think you're right.

633
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,250
Don't give me that evasive nonsense.

634
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,280
Why did you bring

635
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,080
Mu Ranwu back?

636
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,590
With all your mood swings,

637
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,920
what will Ranran think?

638
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,430
You must explain it clearly to me today.

639
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,070
Hey,

640
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
what can't you tell me?

641
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,410
Alright.

642
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,360
Let me guess.

643
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
This must've started when you rescued Ranran

644
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
from those bastards of the Scarlet Sect

645
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,190
at the foot of Mount Cuiwei

646
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,670
and couldn't suppress

647
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,070
the violent energy inside you.

648
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,960
I heard you lost control

649
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,800
in Puxin Village too.

650
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
It's related to this, right?

651
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,330
So the Spirit Spring can still affect you.

652
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,440
When I was young,

653
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,150
a drop of Spirit Spring was planted in my heart.

654
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,550
It has always been there,

655
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,280
impossible to remove or eradicate.

656
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,340
It resonates with the Spirit Spring.

657
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,190
Before long,

658
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,400
I won't be able to suppress it anymore

659
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,060
or seal off the Spirit Spring.

660
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,110
Are you saying

661
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,710
you're afraid the Spirit Spring will possess you again?

662
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,230
But

663
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,880
there are still three years

664
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,320
before the netherworld reopens.

665
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,850
Can you hold out until then?

666
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,110
I don't know,

667
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,710
but I absolutely won't

668
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,110
let myself be repossessed.

669
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,070
We must quickly find another way

670
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,530
to enter the netherworld.

671
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,040
Is there any way?

672
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,920
I haven't found one yet,

673
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,320
but when Qingge entered the netherworld back then,

674
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,070
it wasn't during the key opening time either.

675
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,630
So there must be

676
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,320
other ways.

677
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,320
So that's why you're here,

678
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,120
looking through these records.

679
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,390
Is this also the reason

680
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,290
why you pushed Ranran away?

681
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
She can't be

682
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,880
dragged down by me again.

683
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,960
I can't keep her by my side anymore.

684
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,590
I can't let her stay at Mount Wester.

685
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,590
She must form her Golden Core as soon as possible.

686
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,120
This way,

687
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,250
the Soul-Devouring Lock won't have

688
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,760
too much of an effect on her.

689
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,960
After she completes her training,

690
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
she'll have the ability to protect herself

691
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,920
and pursue

692
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,020
the life she wants.

693
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,110
This isn't something that can be rushed.

694
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,620
Besides, Ranran is still far from

695
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,020
forming her Golden Core.

696
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,630
It'll be possible

697
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,030
if she can enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

698
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,760
Many elite talents from various Heavenly Sects

699
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,070
participate in the Marrow-Cleansing Conference,

700
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,960
but only one person can enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.

701
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,670
They'll definitely do everything they can to achieve that.

702
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,070
Even if Ranran has the ability,

703
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,670
she may not necessarily win.

704
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,190
What are you pondering now?

705
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,670
You should take it easy.

706
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,070
Being too obsessive

707
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,670
will only make your emotions unstable.

708
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,150
If your Ice Lotus Technique breaks,

709
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,710
you'll lose your Transcendence Realm power.

710
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,360
Even if you find

711
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,480
a way to enter the netherworld,

712
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,340
you won't be able to seal the Spirit Spring anymore.

713
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,510
Nothing can change

714
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,110
my plan.

715
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,760
Even if my Ice Lotus Technique breaks

716
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,070
and I fall from the Transcendence Realm,

717
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,840
I can still use my body to seal the Spirit Spring

718
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,440
to prevent future troubles.

719
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,920
So what you said before

720
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
was all true.

721
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,960
Xi'er,

722
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,990
stop sleeping.

723
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,040
Don't you like liveliness?

724
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,410
Wake up quickly.

725
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,200
I'll take you to the market.

726
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,280
I'll buy you your favorite food.

727
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Please wake up, okay?

728
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,250
Senior Gao,

729
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,710
as soon as I built my Foundation,

730
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,550
I started the furnace and refined this Foundation Stabilizing Pill

731
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,480
for Xi'er to try.

732
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,960
Okay.

733
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,960
Ranran,

734
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,230
you seem quite different after you built your Foundation.

735
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,410
I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.

736
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:05,840
Senior Gao,

737
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,400
are you confused from exhaustion?

738
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,150
I don't understand

739
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,280
what you're saying.

740
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,300
It's just that the current you

741
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,560
reminds me of someone,

742
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,360
but I can't quite put my finger on whom.

743
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,830
-Xi'er.
-Xi'er.

744
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,680
You're awake?

745
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,710
Come,

746
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,670
take it easy.

747
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,210
Xi'er,

748
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,560
are you alright?

749
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,370
We're back at Mount Wester?

750
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Here, have some water

751
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,260
to soothe your throat.

752
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,020
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

753
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,360
You want to know what happened to us,

754
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,780
right?

755
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
To be honest, we're not sure either.

756
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,150
That wave came out of nowhere.

757
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,900
Master didn't say much about it.

758
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,880
But the important thing is

759
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,940
we're all fine now.

760
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,360
There's also some good news.

761
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,230
Ranran has successfully built her Foundation.

762
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,210
Impressive.

763
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,290
We've fallen behind again.

764
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,630
Don't worry.

765
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,920
You just focus on getting better.

766
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,520
I'll practice hard with you.

767
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,420
We'll try to catch up with her.

768
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,920
Ranran.

769
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,320
Ranran.

770
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,000
Xi'er,

771
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,080
you're awake?

772
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,680
That's great!

773
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,860
Here's a letter from the Alcohol Immortal for you.

774
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,610
Come, have some more.

775
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,510
Ranran,

776
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
the runes you sent

777
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,110
are the Empyrean Bone Sacrifice Formation.

778
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,190
This is the very formation that the Heavenly Sects

779
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,630
used to kill Mu back then.

780
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,510
Who would dare use this formation

781
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,410
to harm the people of Mount Wester?

782
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,360
This formation is intricate and mysterious.

783
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,550
Apart from the sovereigns of the Four Sects

784
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,680
who set it up before,

785
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,510
no one else should be able to master it precisely.
