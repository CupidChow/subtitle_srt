1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ooh.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,640
to face the love and hate of the world

3
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,000
I only wish that by turning back time

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,800
I can experience both the present and the future

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Only by achieving the reincarnation can I understand the preciousness

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,920
Even if I know that the true meaning of life is to be returned to the past

7
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,760
I am destined to be tamed by love

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,280
But I am still fearless and never regret

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,720
The love and hate of the world

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,760
Will eventually be erased

11
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,760
The Legend of Chusen

12
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Episode 16

13
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
It's all in the past.

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Since it has changed,

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
I should let go

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
and live my own life.

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Sister Feihua,

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
keep these talismans for emergency use.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
If there are still some that you can't handle,

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
come to Xishan to find me at any time.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Take care.

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Take care.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
You are right.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Chu Zhenhe and Ranran actually...

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
You are the only one who is right.

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
It has been so long, and you still can't see the owner's love and hatred for her.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
They are like this now.

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I am not surprised at all.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Then, you also know that the owner was sealed.

30
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
I only thought that the owner knew that Brother Mu Qing was a demon,

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
but still loved him.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I didn't know that the truth of the matter was like this.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
So it was him who was protecting the owner.

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
We actually misunderstood him for so many years.

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
So, Master was sealed

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
and couldn't say anything.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
No wonder I feel that Ranran looks more and more like someone.

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
It turned out to be the master I met before.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
The temperament is indeed like him,

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
but the appearance is different.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
I couldn't recognize those noblemen.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
After all, they have been reborn once.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
What?

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Are you going to be my identity?

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
No.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
We just got all the information,

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
and our brains are still in a daze.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I haven't decided yet

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
whether to call you Ranran or your master.

50
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
How old am I?

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Of course I am your junior.

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Senior Brother,

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
don't think that you can just pay me back

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
with the three taels of silver.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Xiao,

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
you are not allowed to tell Second Brother

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
that you are secretly making up secrets and ignoring me.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
I will be jealous.

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Just now, Master said that

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
you used your five-factor spiritual root

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
to save him.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
We need to use our spiritual power to protect you.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
How is it? Is it warmer now?

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Thank you.

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
It's not as dangerous as Master said.

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
And I said that

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
you all have no idea

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
about the danger we are facing now.

69
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Master is a demon son.

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
His spiritual power is now with him.

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
He will surely become a great envoy

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
if he follows Master.

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
And we are going to the You Realm.

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
The Demon Realm is like a temple.

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
It's hard to understand the danger.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Master wants me to ask you all.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
The most stable thing for you now

78
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
is to announce the separation from West Mountain.

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
How can this work?

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't break the rules.

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Master can't drive me away.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I will never betray my master.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
This is the shame of a cultivator.

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,640
I will never leave you again.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Besides, we are of the same family.

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
We can't just be together.

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You even lost your spiritual root

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
and you still want to go with me.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I will not lose to you.

90
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Yes.

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
You and Master are very loyal.

92
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
As cultivators, how can you be so careless?

93
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
And even if you are misunderstood,

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
there will always be a day when the truth is revealed.

95
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
This is a good opportunity.

96
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
I want to be like you

97
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
and do something amazing

98
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Yes.

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Let's seal the spiritual power back to the Demon Realm

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and protect the world.

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Okay.

102
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Let's do this amazing thing together.

103
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Okay.

104
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
The way to enter the Demon Realm.

105
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Blood Moon.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Blood Moon is born in the Demon Realm

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and only shines on the most sacred land in the human world.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It absorbs the anger and nourishes the Demon Realm.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It only stays for one moment.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The purple stone is the Moon Line

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and the demon is the blood line.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It can connect Yin and Yang.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The book only says

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that Blood Moon only appears in the most

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
killing place in the human world

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but does not indicate the specific direction.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The most killing place

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is it the battlefield?

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The border between the Qi and the Lin State

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is always covered with rubble.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The war is frequent and the battle is fierce.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Especially the recent battle of the Demon Realm.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's the most fierce.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If Blood Moon is born in the human world

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the battlefield of the Demon Realm is the most likely.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The cracks in the Silver-Blooded Pond are getting worse.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We have to send Lin Quan back to the Demon Realm as soon as possible.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's set off now.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll inform Yu Tong and the others.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I forgot that you just lost your spiritual power.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can't be so tired.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's rest for a night and set off tomorrow.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's fine.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I do want to set off later.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have some preparations to do.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What preparations?

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't use the spiritual power to transform.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Demon Realm is a place of the Yin and the Yin.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The Demon Realm is a place of the Yin and the Yin.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The cracks are huge and the danger is hard to predict.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But I haven't finished yet.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The spiritual power of the person who draws the pen

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
will also increase the power of the pen.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You just lost your spiritual power.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The power of the pen will also be reduced.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I know.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can only use the pen to draw.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not that troublesome.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Just change the paper.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The power of the pen can be ten times more than the ordinary paper.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The paper is so expensive.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You have so much money.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm also from the royal family.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The family of Xishan

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
can't beat those big companies.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The Jixing Prefecture,

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the Mumao Prefecture,

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and the Lingduan Prefecture.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You've drawn them all.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Your spiritual power

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and the paper are all added.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Isn't this the legendary best-quality talisman?

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The world is in danger.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your spirit is broken.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your spirit is broken.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There's no way you can borrow it.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm worried about the paper.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
By the way,

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
can you borrow the power of the heaven and earth?

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can borrow the power of the heaven and earth.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We can borrow the power of the heaven and earth.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But the power of the pen is different from the power of the pen.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you want to draw the pen at any time,

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you have to use the magic of the soul-losing lock

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to draw the pen.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Of course, I can't use the power of the pen.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But don't forget,

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I used half of the golden elixir to exchange you.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The power of the golden elixir in my body is born to be able to draw.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Even without the magic, it can be used.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've given you all my spiritual power.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Try to borrow it.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can borrow your spiritual power.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, no matter where you go,

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
remember to stay by my side.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can use my spiritual power as you like.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As the saying goes,

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
there's a limit, there's a return.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Since our spiritual power is interlinked,

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll teach you the skill of breaking the star box.

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If one day, I borrow a lot of spiritual power,

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can borrow my spiritual power to fight against the enemy.

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're my master for one day.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Su Yu.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Xue Ran Ran.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You all wait.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I won't let you live easily.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think after using Su Yu water's antidote

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to remove the grudge,

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've finally been able to control it.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll be able to control it.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think after using Su Yu water's antidote

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
to remove the grudge,

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've finally been able to control it.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What did he do?

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can't keep doing this.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What?

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Seeing me so weak,

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you don't even call me a master?

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're still a master?

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're still a master?

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're still a master?

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Or did you hear some rumors

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and you're so disrespectful to me?

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've stewed the spiritual juice.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You need to get better first.

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The courtyard in the mountains is quiet and secluded.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's suitable for you to cultivate.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's the use of eating this spiritual juice?

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's the use of eating this spiritual juice?

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
From tomorrow,

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll have you send me ten sticks every day.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,180
I want to be a

232
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,180
I want to be a

233
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
I want to be a

234
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,180
I want to be a

235
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
I want to be a

236
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,180
I want to be a

237
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,620
Some minds just simply

238
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
die at the hasta when an incident like this is to happen.

239
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,820
So what else do you have left?

240
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
The disciples from eastVISHAN

241
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
followed me.

242
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,080
I told them

243
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,580
nothing about the rock incident

244
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
because you're in the disadvantaged moment.

245
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,580
When things are Monglons...

246
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,060
you will share it with them.

247
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
Xiao Wu.

248
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,440
What he said is true.

249
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,220
Did I really…

250
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,540
Didn't I say it completely?

251
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,860
I just thought it's hard to tell.

252
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,200
I swear if that's what you wanted to see,

253
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,960
the murderer could have told us.

254
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,640
Only those who could find an owner

255
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,360
could stay to kill the murderer.

256
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
but we haven't yet.

257
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,180
Do you have to show me what you want?

258
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,740
Be honest with us

259
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,280
and tell us what you really want.

260
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,960
If that's what you want,

261
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,840
we should look for an Place of Last scattered parts for us.

262
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,380
Let's find a way out

263
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,720
Go

264
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,780
You have promised that

265
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,700
I would confess with them personally

266
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
But why...

267
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,300
When did I promise it?

268
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,860
Su Yu

269
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,860
Crown princess

270
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,120
The crown princess

271
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,480
and Su Yun

272
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,100
Bi throughout the whole family

273
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,300
Crown Princess Consort,

274
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,540
and Consort Zhan.

275
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,460
All the best of them

276
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,820
were in my hands.

277
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,740
But when I turned around,

278
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,020
nothing was left.

279
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,180
I didn't have any way out.

280
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,620
At worst,

281
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,260
I'll die here.

282
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,740
In case I'll suffer

283
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,060
the humiliation and despair of being shameless.

284
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,060
Why are you doing this?

285
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,940
Xiaowu.

286
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,540
Fine.

287
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,380
I won't say anything.

288
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
Why?

289
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,260
You like me?

290
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,140
Do you think I should be

291
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,780
grateful to you

292
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,020
for my love?

293
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
No.

294
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,180
Do you remember

295
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,060
when you saved me

296
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,060
at the foot of the West Mountain 25 years ago?

297
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,300
I've been self-righteous

298
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,260
and bullied by my brothers.

299
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,820
You're the one who helped me.

300
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,260
I thought you were a disciple of the West Mountain

301
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,740
and you were the one who helped them.

302
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm grateful to you.

303
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,780
Every time you go to the West Mountain,

304
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,700
I'm happy to see you.

305
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,100
I've always hoped

306
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
that you could live a happier life.

307
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
Now,

308
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,100
I hope you can stop

309
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,980
and think about what you really need

310
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,300
and where you should go.

311
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,100
I need the spiritual treasure.

312
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,780
I need to be reborn.

313
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,020
I need to get everything back.

314
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,060
You're obviously angry with me.

315
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,380
You're so lucky.

316
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,260
You're so rich.

317
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
But you don't want to give me

318
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,660
more spiritual treasures.

319
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,780
Yet you still say these nonsense

320
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,020
to fool me.

321
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,260
I'm just an ordinary soldier.

322
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,740
I'm more confident in my talent.

323
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,140
But I'm not a talent.

324
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,100
Master also taught me

325
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,860
to be upright and honest.

326
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,340
Only when you have the ability

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,460
to make the right choice

328
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,980
can you make the right choice.

329
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,380
Master, Master, Master,

330
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,860
you're always right.

331
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,100
He's lucky.

332
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,980
He has everything he wants.

333
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,300
He doesn't need to fight for it.

334
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,940
But I

335
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,980
rarely get what I want.

336
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm wrong if I want more.

337
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,420
You said you liked me.

338
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,880
You feel like money but you like nothing

339
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,420
herbs wine...

340
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,580
Are you trying to hostile me?

341
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,660
Ziplling the royal family

342
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,900
to poison the people.

343
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,620
Oh my poor son.

344
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
This kind of thing should be scratched

345
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Yes

346
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Thief

347
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Thief

348
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
Catch him

349
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,620
Be careful

350
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
You are over there

351
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
chase

352
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
The Chu Jianjun of the Yugu Chu is so dirty

353
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
Defeated me, the reputation of Xingshan

354
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Not only

355
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
I guess he also told the identity of Master's demon son

356
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
To all the schools

357
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,620
To kill us with a knife

358
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Once the Xuanmen wants to intervene

359
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
I'm afraid we can't control the enemy

360
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,620
Be careful

361
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Yanlu has set up a barrier

362
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Can only cover up the appearance with a sword

363
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,620
But can't hide the Xuanmen

364
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
The time to seal the Linquan can't be missed

365
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
If you meet the people of the Xuanmen

366
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,620
If you can avoid it, avoid it

367
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
Less trouble

368
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Yes

369
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
Yes

370
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Not enough

371
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
I want better

372
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
But this is the best quality of the spirit medicine

373
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
That's the problem with the elixir furnace

374
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Go find me a better elixir furnace

375
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
You are in trouble

376
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Then you can leave

377
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
I didn't force you to stay

378
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
I know you still need some time

379
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Can think through

380
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
I can wait for you

381
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
rest assured

382
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
I won't leave you

383
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,620
There is no way out

384
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
You came in so fast

385
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
how

386
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Su Yu decided to kill me

387
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
You misunderstood

388
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
I'm not here to harm you

389
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
But to ask for cooperation for the crown prince

390
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Cooperation

391
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
How is it possible

392
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I heard it with my own ears

393
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,620
He ordered you to kill me

394
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Now the crown prince is in danger

395
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,620
I need to find a great power to kill him

396
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
If the immortal teacher is willing to help

397
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,620
The identity of the Queen of War is still yours

398
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,620
In the past, everything was returned to the hands of the immortal teacher

399
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Not only that, that great power

400
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,620
It can also help you to obtain supreme spiritual power

401
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
I'm sorry

402
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,620
I'm sorry

403
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,620
What you want will come back

404
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Then who is the great power he is looking for?

405
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
It's him

406
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
But he has disappeared for a long time

407
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
How do you know where he is?

408
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,620
He suddenly disappeared at the beginning

409
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,620
It was sealed by Mu Qingge in the Youjie

410
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Su Yishui is going to the Youjie now

411
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,620
You just need to get into the Youjie in the midst of chaos

412
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
You can find him

413
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
With his help

414
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,620
I can definitely get back my spiritual power

415
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Step on him

416
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Just according to my current power

417
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,620
How can I hide Su Yishui and get into the Youjie?

418
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Don't worry

419
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,620
His Highness has already declared the identity of Su Yishui and the Demon Son

420
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,620
To all the sects

421
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,620
You just need to add another fire

422
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,620
Those sects will be used by you

423
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
When I took the disciples to the East Sea

424
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Su Yishui had already escaped

425
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
He didn't even return to the West Mountain

426
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Where did the Demon Son escape to?

427
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
I know where the Demon Son is

428
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,620
I'll go and find him

429
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Mu Qingge

430
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Why did you pretend to be the Demon Son

431
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,620
and fool us all?

432
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,620
Please don't be angry

433
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Su Yishui threatened me with the life of Wu

434
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
He forced me to admit my identity as the Demon Son

435
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,620
He could control the spiritual power and take the world

436
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
But I don't know what went wrong

437
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,620
He brought me back to life and transferred my attention to everyone

438
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
I only knew when I was reborn that he lied to me

439
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Wu was already killed by him

440
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,620
After that, he forced me to set up the soul world

441
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,620
As long as I say that Su Yishui is the Demon Son

442
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,620
It really is the soul world

443
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Now he is taking the spiritual power to the Youjie

444
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Please stop the Demon Son from coming to the world

445
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
Calm down, immortals

446
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Even if there is a soul world

447
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,620
it doesn't mean that what he said is true

448
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,620
He can't even get rid of his previous evil deeds

449
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,620
I know that I'm sorry to all of you who are suffering from the Heaven's Prowess

450
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
He forced me to do so

451
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,620
He was the one who planted my grudge

452
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,620
I had no choice but to say that in the Heaven's Prowess

453
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
Now I finally have the grudge

454
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
I don't want to help the evil

455
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,620
I don't want to be the pawn in the world of the Demon Son

456
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Such a vicious man

457
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,620
It's really hard to escape from the Heaven's power

458
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Where is the Demon Son now?

459
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
He is taking the disciples of Mount Xi to guard the direction of the demon

460
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Jiu Hua disciples, listen to my order

461
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Now I'm seriously injured

462
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,620
Liang Yu, you will be the host

463
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
We will gather the power of the whole sect

464
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
to capture the Demon Son, Su Yi Shui

465
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
Yes

466
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,620
Take back the spiritual power with us

467
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Yes

468
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Fei Yun's disciples, follow me

469
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Chase the Demon Son

470
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Yes

471
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Our Kongshan Sect is also willing to do so

472
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,620
There are many Xuan Meng disciples on the way

473
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,620
Xuan Meng is going to attack us

474
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
It seems that

475
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
there was a big battle here before

476
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,620
A lot of grudges are coming out in the air

477
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
The spiritual power seems to have a special feeling for this place

478
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
It seems that the two sects are fighting each other

479
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,620
They are fighting each other

480
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,620
They are fighting each other

481
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,620
There is a special feeling here

482
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,220
It seems that the entrance to the

483
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,620
Contemporary World is here

484
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
I have planted the talisman here

485
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Blood and blood will appear

486
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
There must be a reaction at the same time

487
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
In the next few hours

488
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
You go to the nearby town to feed the stomach

489
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
But at this time

490
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
I can't eat anything

491
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Relax

492
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
The more dangerous it is

493
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
The more we have to eat, play and drink

494
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
The camera is short

495
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
We will have something to do after the fight

496
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Be low-key

497
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
Eat high-key, right?

498
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
You are right, Ran Ran

499
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
The water gate is still looking for us

500
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
There are many people outside

501
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Why don't we take separate actions

502
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Wait for the blood to appear

503
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Come back here for a meeting

504
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Although it's the first time I came to Wuma Town

505
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
I feel a little familiar

506
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Because you came in the last life

507
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
No wonder

508
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Chenji Water Buns in Wanjing

509
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
There is also here

510
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
You just saw it in Wanjing

511
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
You can try it now

512
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Let's try it

513
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,620
it is good

514
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,620
Master, you don't look nervous at all

515
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,620
So many storms have come

516
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
I believe I can get through this time

517
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Besides, didn't you say

518
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Eat well before the big battle

519
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
It's busy here

520
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I'll take you around later

521
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,620
it is good

522
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Come and try the dipping sauce in Wanjing

523
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
How about it

524
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
After returning the spiritual power to the Youjie

525
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
We will travel around the world together

526
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
Eat all over the world

527
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
it is good

528
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Eat quickly

529
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
Master, skewers

530
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
Yangchuan in the refrigerator

531
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
How many skewers do you want?

532
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Come boss, come to Wuchuan

533
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,620
it is good

534
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Take it

535
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Thank you

536
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
it is good

537
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Take care

538
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
It smells good

539
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Yangchuan, Yangchuan

540
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
it is good

541
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
it is good

542
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
Awesome

543
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,620
Congratulations to this girl

544
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Won the treasure of our shop

545
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
it is good

546
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
The treasure of the shop

547
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
That's the prize?

548
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Girl, don't underestimate this mirror

549
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
This is called the marriage mirror

550
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,620
It is said that there is a mirror fairy in it

551
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,620
As long as you sincerely knock on the mirror

552
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
You can see your ex-lover

553
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,620
So magical, really

554
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Girl, look

555
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,620
Come on, next one

556
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Next one

557
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Come on

558
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,620
Master, am I being deceived?

559
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
This mirror is not bright at all

560
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,620
How can it be not bright

561
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
You close your eyes and try again

562
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Open it

563
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,620
Open it

564
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
Open it

565
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Open it

566
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,620
Open it

567
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Look

568
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
The ex-lover is here

569
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Go

570
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
This nowb and ed Hmm

571
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
This advance Professor

572
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Lots of plants

573
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
우와

574
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,620
Let it be

575
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
why

576
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,340
The lanterns are so good.

577
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,740
You may not know,

578
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,620
the lantern festival is in a few days.

579
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,660
The single men and women will give each other lanterns.

580
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,620
It's a good deal.

581
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,180
So everyone is in a hurry to buy

582
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,660
their favorite lanterns in advance.

583
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,020
Boss.

584
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,620
Lantern festival.

585
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,740
I heard that in a few days,

586
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,340
there will be a lantern festival in the Wuma Town.

587
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,220
Master,

588
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,220
these lanterns are so beautiful.

589
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,300
These are beautiful.

590
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,420
Don't you think the lanterns I made are beautiful?

591
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,260
The lanterns you made?

592
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,700
Some people

593
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,500
are not only jealous,

594
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,060
but also very stubborn.

595
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,420
I was impulsive.

596
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,740
How about

597
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,620
I make one for you?

598
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,660
Is it good?

599
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,300
Really?

600
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes.

601
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,660
I've studied it.

602
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,180
The bamboo on the mountain is the best for lanterns.

603
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,220
Master,

604
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,540
I'll lend you some spiritual power.

605
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,740
There's a spiritual power vibration.

606
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,780
It's my original spiritual power.

607
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,660
Did I hide something

608
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,100
in this cave before?

609
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,500
Let's go and have a look.

610
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,420
Okay.

611
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,940
Let's go.

612
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,340
Eternal Fire?

613
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,780
I'll use the precious Eternal Fire

614
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,020
to light these lanterns.

615
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,860
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

616
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,180
I'll show you

617
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,180
something good then.

618
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,500
Are these

619
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,580
breaker seaweed Powder?

620
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,860
This is...

621
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,980
I just remembered something.

622
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,500
You used to like lanterns.

623
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,100
So I made these to give you.

624
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,220
But I don't remember

625
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,900
why you like lanterns.

626
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,940
I was poor when I was young.

627
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,340
I saw children on the street

628
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,580
walking on the street with lanterns on that festival.

629
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,900
I was envious.

630
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,660
I comforted myself every time.

631
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,420
I will be able to see lanterns next year.

632
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:45,000
I

633
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,380
need change.

634
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,360
Then I took these money.

635
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,140
Come and save me, please.

636
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,020
These memories may not historically stay.

637
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,820
However, there's something between the two.

638
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,340
Only those who care about others

639
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,100
can know like them even without their words.

640
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,620
Are you...

641
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,820
You hurt others by XXXX.

642
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,180
And you lost a family to someone?

643
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,780
Look!

644
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,820
How dare you!

645
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,740
Is that how much ahiling I mean?

646
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
You burned him. I want your life.

647
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Don't let your life

648
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,420
be destroyed.

649
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
You missed the only chance to kill me

650
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
and get freedom.

651
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Don't you feel sorry?

652
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,420
I, Su Yishui, never take advantage of others.

653
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,420
Besides, I will defeat you

654
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
with my strength

655
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
and break the relationship of the world.

656
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Okay.

657
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Then I'll wait for that day.

658
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,420
But before that,

659
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
you have to take care of yourself.

660
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,420
If you really want to be lazy,

661
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,420
just tell me if you need anything.

662
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
I'll take care of it for you.

663
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Zhu He.

664
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
I'll be with you

665
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
forever.

666
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
I'll be with you

667
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
day after day,

668
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,420
year after year.

669
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
Okay.

670
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
In the end,

671
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
the story is

672
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
in the past.

673
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
The years

674
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
are just

675
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
a thousand years.

676
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I heard that in a few days,

677
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
there will be a lantern festival in the Wuma Town.

678
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

679
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
I'll show you

680
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
something good.

681
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
At this moment, I can remember

682
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,420
the mood of every lantern

683
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
that is made here.

684
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
You once said

685
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
that it's not only my past,

686
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
but also my love.

687
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Wuma Town

688
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
has a custom of sending lanterns to express their love.

689
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
The lanterns in the town

690
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
are the answer.

691
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
I think

692
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
I used to

693
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
be your fan.

694
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Ren Ren.

695
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
I used to complain that my fate is not good enough.

696
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
But actually, I've been

697
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
by your side

698
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,420
for a long time.

699
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
I'm sorry.

700
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
I'm sorry.

701
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm sorry.

702
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
I'm sorry.

703
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
I'm sorry.

704
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
I'm sorry.

705
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
I'm sorry.

706
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I'm sorry.

707
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
I'm sorry.

709
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I'm sorry.

710
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
I'm sorry.

711
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
I'm sorry.

712
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
I'm so sorry.

714
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
I'm so sorry.

716
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
I'm so sorry.

718
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Yun Dong has a reaction.

719
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
The Right Sword appears.

720
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
Inform them.

721
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Blood Moon.

722
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,700
When Blood Moon is completely visible,

723
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,780
the Soul Trap will appear.

724
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Demon Lord!

725
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,980
Hand over the Spirit Spring!

726
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,660
Su Yi Shui.

727
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,420
You've deceived the world with your own master.

728
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,300
Now you're still a demon,

729
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,100
yet you're using the Spirit Spring to enter the fire.

730
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,620
My disciples from the Xuan Sect

731
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,500
will never allow you to harm the people.

732
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,140
I advise you to destroy the object in time

733
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,660
and seek to get rid of it.

734
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,540
Su, it's not too late to turn back now.

735
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,420
I won't kill you like I did before.

736
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,660
My master is a demon,

737
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,740
but he doesn't want to use the Spirit Spring to cause trouble.

738
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,980
We're doing this to seal the Spirit Spring,

739
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,020
not to use the Spirit Spring to enter the fire.

740
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,300
That's right.

741
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,260
You're stupid.

742
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,460
How can the demon's words be true?

743
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,700
Since you chose to use the Spirit Spring to help the evil,

744
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,140
don't blame us for being rude.

745
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,740
There's only one minute. We have to hurry.

746
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,900
The Demon Realm has been sealed.

747
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,260
The Demon Realm has been sealed.

748
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,940
The Demon Realm has been sealed.

749
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,060
The Demon Realm has been sealed.

750
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,940
Wait a moment.

751
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,220
Xi, what's wrong?

752
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,700
Why did I lose my mind just now?

754
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,420
I only have hatred and hatred for you.

755
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,300
It must be because of the demon aura.

756
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
What should I do?

757
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,220
The demon aura will seduce people and lead them to the demon.

758
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,940
Take this Green Heart Pill.

759
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,380
You can dissipate the demon and regain your consciousness.

760
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,220
You're on the same side with the demon.

761
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,060
Who knows what you're up to?

762
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
I'll show you.

763
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,820
My Qin.

764
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,060
Now you are here.

765
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
Team Leader is here.

766
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Gold Fall?

767
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Silver Boss.

768
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,140
Cang Li sale it.

769
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Cun Jing,

770
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,820
Sea Bass,

771
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,540
Dragon Yetater,

772
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,860
I want the basic skills of Jade Pond mansion

773
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,660
and the life ahíre in the important place.

774
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,660
I think

775
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,560
こと

776
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,860
Why is that?

777
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,900
Pass on my boomerang

778
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,140
Give back my boomerang

779
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,940
Miss

780
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,580
My Search

781
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,340
Mitre

782
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,020
Yes

783
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,220
My broom

784
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,180
Yes

785
00:40:43,180 --> 00:41:07,220
Didn't my legacy

786
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm fine.

787
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,780
Are you telling the truth?

788
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,220
So, you really want to seal the spiritual power?

789
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,620
If Master really wants to enter the Demon Realm,

790
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,860
why must he save you?

791
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,340
No.

792
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,100
Where is Mo Ran?

793
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
Are you all right?

794
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,420
The Demon Realm is in a state of panic.

795
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,260
You're using the Talisman Spell and still need to adapt.

796
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,620
Is this the Demon Realm?

797
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,660
I think the entrance is already closed.

798
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,820
How do we get out?

799
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,180
If the Demon Realm opens the entrance once,

800
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,620
it will give birth to an exit.

801
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,380
But the exit can't come out or come back.

802
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,180
And it only exists for three hours.

803
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,460
The most troublesome thing is

804
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,020
to open it in the mortal world.

805
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,220
Then this time...

806
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,620
This time, we have to open it in the mortal world.

807
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
This time...

808
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,460
This time, we're lucky.

809
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,820
The exit is in the mountain not far from the Five-Horse Town.

810
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,140
Look.

811
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,460
It's on that peak.

812
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,900
In three hours,

813
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,660
we'll find the ancient town of the seal.

814
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,060
Then we can leave.

815
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,220
Where are the others?

816
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
Watch out!

817
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,220
Su Yi Shui, you're quite smart.

818
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Xue Ran Ran,

819
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,580
no wonder I thought you were interesting.

820
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,180
So you're the Mother.

821
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,620
Don't worry.

822
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,260
Once I've solved Su Yi Shui's problem,

823
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,700
we'll calculate the last century's problem.

824
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,580
I'm sorry.

825
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,660
I'm sorry.

826
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,740
I'm sorry.

827
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
I'm sorry.

828
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,900
I'm sorry.

829
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,980
I'm sorry.

830
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
I'm sorry.

831
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
I'm sorry.

832
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,220
I'm sorry.

833
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
I'm sorry.

834
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,380
I'm sorry.

835
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,460
I'm sorry.

836
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,540
I'm sorry.

837
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,620
I'm sorry.

838
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,700
I'm sorry.

839
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
I'm sorry.

840
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
I'm sorry.

841
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,940
I'm sorry.

842
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,020
I'm sorry.

843
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,100
I'm sorry.

844
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,180
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,260
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,420
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,660
I'm sorry.

851
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,260
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,420
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,500
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,580
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,660
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,740
I'm sorry.

858
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,820
I'm sorry.

859
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,900
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,060
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,140
I'm sorry.

863
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,220
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,300
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,380
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,460
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,620
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
I'm sorry.

870
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,780
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,860
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,940
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,100
I'm sorry.

875
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
I'm sorry.

876
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,260
I'm sorry.

877
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
I'm sorry.
