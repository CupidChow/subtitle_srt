Strength Boost.

16
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,070
It's a lot lighter.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah.

18
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,030
Soul Skills are not allowed.

19
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,200
Why?

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,310
If we don't use Soul Skills,

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,310
what are we training for?

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
Train your body muscles.

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,120
What's the point of that?

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,600
How long can your
White Tiger Vajra Transformation

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
last?

26
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,800
About an hour.

27
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,670
Why can't it be longer?

28
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,120
If I go past my limits, my body will ache.

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,910
Correct.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
When you use Soul Skills,

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,040
it creates a huge burden on your body.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,200
Every muscle,

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
every bone,

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,230
is withstanding pressure.

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,000
If you train your body well,

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,950
your Soul Skills can last longer

37
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,070
and become more powerful.

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,040
Anyone else wants to say this is meaningless?

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,360
Come on.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
If someone can't finish it,

41
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,950
everyone will be punished.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,070
I won't be following you.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,510
You can cheat during the training.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,480
Just remember.

45
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,760
You can deceive me, but not yourself.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,040
Without determination,

47
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,840
you won't last as a Soul Master.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,590
Let's go.

49
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,360
Come on.

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,870
Wait for Rong Rong.

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,310
Hurry.

52
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,360
The pampered one

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,390
should just go home!

54
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll help you later.

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on.

56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,720
Wait for me!

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,870
Rong Rong.

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,950
I'm the daughter of the Ning family.

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,230
I'll never admit defeat!

60
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,150
Good.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,790
Gang.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:35,870
Here.

63
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,230
I understand your intention.

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,000
But shouldn't it be done progressively?

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,480
Ask them to run such a long distance

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,230
in the beginning,

67
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,200
isn't it too difficult?

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,670
It's impossible for some of them to finish it.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,000
You want to kick a few of them out?

70
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,280
No.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,670
Unless they understand the meaning of teamwork.

72
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,040
True.

73
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,590
Brother Dai.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
Why don't we wait for them?

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,760
No way.

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
The sign is right ahead.

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,000
We'll rest only when we reach it.

78
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,840
Look back.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,480
Yeah, we really can't go on anymore.

80
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,040
The sign is totally out of sight.

81
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Ou Si Ke and Ning Rong Rong

82
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,680
can't carry on.

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,430
How far have we gone?

84
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,310
Perhaps not even half of it.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,430
Ou Si Ke.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
Give your rocks to me first.

87
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,870
Brother Dai.

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,396
Rong Rong's basket is the least heavy.

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,750
You can take Rong Rong's one.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,630
No need.

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
I can handle it.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
I don't need your help.

93
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,910
We are a team now.

94
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,880
You heard what Master said too.

95
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,950
If any one of us can't finish it,

96
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,510
everyone will be punished together.

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,910
We carry it on first.

98
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,560
When we can't hold on anymore,

99
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,470
we'll return it to you.

100
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,800
I disagree.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,390
Give me the heavier one. You take the lighter one.

102
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,550
Ou Si Ke.

103
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,270
Give me.

104
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,710
Brother Dai.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,830
You're a little different today

106
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,270
from who you usually are.

107
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,080
What's the difference?

108
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,430
You're especially compliant
to Master's order today.

109
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,200
Also, you're not fierce to me today

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,920
as usual.

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,550
Am I usually fierce to you?

112
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,150
Tang San.

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
When we were in the Star Forest,

114
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,960
you surprised me.

115
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,040
Me?

116
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,830
You had great willpower.

117
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,520
You could even overcome a Soul Beast's nature.

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,920
It was impressive.

119
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,480
You flatter me.

120
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,640
I just wanted to protect my sister.

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,310
Actually, I want to be stronger.

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,110
I really want to.

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,520
I know.

124
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,040
As long as it makes me stronger,

125
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,990
I'm willing to try anything.

126
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
Even if that person has only Double Soul Rings

127
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,870
and his Soul Power is no match for me.

128
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,040
Brother Dai.

129
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,430
Actually, Master

130
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,590
is not who you think he is.

131
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,430
Tang San.

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,710
Give my rocks back to me.

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,110
I can carry them.

134
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,550
Hold on a little longer.

135
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,240
Let's discuss it when we see the sign.

136
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,800
It's right ahead.

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,200
Come on.

138
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,870
Come.

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,920
Have some water, Brother Dai.

140
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,080
Thank you.

141
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
Tang San, drink it.

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:51,990
Thank you.

143
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,150
Wu.

144
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,590
Why is this salt water?

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
This must be what Master prepared for us.

146
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,710
Drink more.

147
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,710
Don't drink too much.

148
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,150
After taking a rest,

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
let's make the trip back.

150
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,150
Give me my rocks.

151
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,760
Alright, here.

152
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,920
Brother Dai.

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,550
Give back my rocks to me too.

154
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
If you can't hold on later, give them to me again.

155
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,990
Slowly, slowly.

156
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,150
I don't think we can make it before lunchtime.

157
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,080
Luckily, we had enough breakfast.

158
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,950
Lunch?

159
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,110
It'll be a miracle if they can make it for dinner.

160
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you think

161
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,390
I should go and check on them?

162
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,040
No way.

163
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,950
Two reasons.

164
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,440
First.

165
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
The tougher it gets,

166
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,230
the more we should stay away.

167
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,390
In the future,

168
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
they have to face

169
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,910
the hardest challenge on their own.

170
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,190
I can't help but feel that recently

171
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,630
we've switched our positions.

172
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,440
You doted on Tang San.

173
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Now?

174
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,600
You're getting crueller.

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,510
My teaching is based on their aptitudes.

176
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,670
They can bear these things.

177
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,560
Sure, sure. You're right!

178
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
What's the second reason?

179
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,760
The second reason.

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,510
You don't have time to check on them.

181
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,000
Why?

182
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
You should be going out to earn money.

183
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,760
They are having meat every day.

184
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,950
We're spending money every day.

185
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,630
Who is Headmaster now?

186
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,470
You said

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,390
that I'm in charge of training.

188
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,800
Earn money!

189
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,080
Make sure you come back on time.

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,830
Later,

191
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,080
you still have to supervise their lessons.

192
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,960
You treat me like a dog!

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,950
Ma Hong Jun.

194
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,560
Give your rocks to me.

195
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,800
I can handle it.

196
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,190
Cut the cackle.

197
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,710
I don't want to miss dinner

198
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,560
because of you.

199
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,070
I can do it.

200
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm fine.

201
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,440
Give some of yours to me.

202
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,920
No need.

203
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,710
Brother Dai.

204
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,390
Brother Dai, give me

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Hong Jun's rock.

206
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
I can carry it.

207
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,320
No need.

208
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,920
Why is he so persistent today?

209
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,270
Let's go.

210
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,120
Master, we made it.

211
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,800
Rong Rong.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,830
They didn't cheat or give up.

213
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,270
I'm surprised.

214
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,480
They will become the best team.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,830
(Tang San.)

216
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,440
(Tang San.)

217
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,440
Who is it?

218
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,710
(Tang San.)

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,950
(Tang San.)

220
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,270
Hong Jun.

221
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,630
Why are you still awake?

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
I miss my dad.

223
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,710
It's so hard being a Soul Master.

224
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,040
Hong Jun.

225
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,150
Whatever we do,

226
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
we have to make an effort.

227
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,070
Never give up easily.

228
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,590
I won't give up.

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
Aren't both of you going to sleep?

230
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,800
Where's Brother Dai?

231
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,590
Brother Dai said he was going to try

232
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,590
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

233
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,510
He wanted to check if it could last longer.

234
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,320
Today is the first day of training.

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,510
Why is he in a hurry?

236
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,710
I think so.

237
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,880
He seemed really anxious today.

238
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,240
Brother San.

239
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,950
Are you hungry?

240
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,480
Now that you've said it,

241
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,750
I'm kind of hungry.

242
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,150
Ou Si Ke.

243
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Give me two sausages.

244
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,880
I am not a cook.

245
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,190
I know.

246
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,150
I have the fire. I'll cook it.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,560
You...

248
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,070
What are you doing here?

249
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,120
Brother Dai.

250
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,590
Honestly,

251
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,560
you are very important to me.

252
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,630
Had it not been for you,

253
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,390
I wouldn't have come to Shi Lan Ke.

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
I wouldn't have stayed here either.

255
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,590
What do you mean?

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,710
I came for you.

257
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Spiritual attack?

258
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,590
You're too worn out.

259
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,440
There's no way you can resist my spiritual attack.

260
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,590
Tell me.

261
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,750
Tell me all your secrets.

262
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,800
Don't hide anything.

263
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,040
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,680
May I ask

265
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,270
what you want to do

266
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,880
to my cute brother?

267
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,390
When will he regain his awareness?

268
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,390
He is very strong spiritually.

269
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,150
He will wake up soon.

270
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,270
You're his fellow student?

271
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,830
Has he ever mentioned me?

272
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,070
Never.

273
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,750
Do you know who I am?

274
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,510
I don't.

275
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,800
Then why are you scared?

276
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,950
Let's play a game.

277
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,880
I'll close my eyes,

278
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,630
and try to catch you.

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
You're bleeding.

280
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,880
Is it a dark or light color?

281
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
Does it look pretty?

282
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,000
Your breathing seems to disappear.

283
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,120
The smell of your blood has changed.

284
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,120
But this is the blood of a weak person.

285
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,680
I'm familiar with it.

286
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,190
It belongs to my useless brother, right?

287
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,070
You have a Spirit Branch Martial Soul.

288
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,920
You can manipulate Soul Masters?

289
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,630
What is your Martial Soul?

290
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,750
A coward hiding behind him.

291
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,830
You are confident.

292
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,000
You think

293
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,270
that in front of my brother,

294
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,440
I won't be able to attack with my full strength?

295
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,950
He's useless even as a puppet.

296
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,150
White Tiger Intense Light Wave!

297
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,320
Too weak.

298
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,150
White Tiger Vajra Transformation!

299
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,800
Is this all you can do?

300
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,190
Triple Soul Rings.

301
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,150
Unfortunately,

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
it's still too weak.

303
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,510
I'm not a cook!

304
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,270
I make sausages for you?

305
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,590
Alright, enough. Enough!

306
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,560
How about an iron sausage?

307
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,190
Stop fighting!

308
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,950
I'll make an iron bar to beat you up!

309
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,630
Do you want to take a beating?

310
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Enough! Stop!

311
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,560
How about

312
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,560
I find food for both of you?

313
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,070
Stop fighting, alright?

314
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,800
It's late at night and you want...

315
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,440
Just a kiwi...

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,120
I'll come back soon.

317
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,510
Don't fight.

318
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,190
Your acting was pretty good. Good job.

319
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,880
Here.

320
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,800
Have some water.

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,240
Where are you going?

322
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,920
I'm going to Tang San and let him comb my hair.

323
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,950
You must see him all the time?

324
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,270
Even your hair has to be combed by him.

325
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,830
He does it best.

326
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,190
I'm good at it too.

327
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,390
Come, sit here.

328
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,150
I'll comb your hair.

329
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,440
Wu.

330
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,070
I want to ask you something.

331
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,880
Alright.

332
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,710
Have you ever

333
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,150
kissed Tang San?

334
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,510
Don't move! I'm still doing your hair.

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,750
Why would I kiss Tang San?

336
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
What is your relationship with him?

337
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,800
He's my brother.

338
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,630
And then?

339
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,000
What?

340
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,630
My dad told me

341
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,920
that if any man wants to call me sister,

342
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,630
I should beat him up.

343
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Why?

344
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,120
He said

345
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,630
that men would call themselves brothers,

346
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,440
but they would become beasts later.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,320
Why would they turn into beasts?

348
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,190
I don't know either.

349
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,190
It should be mutual affection.

350
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,710
But what do the beast and affection

351
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,710
have to do with each other?

352
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,680
I asked my dad too.

353
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,630
He said

354
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,270
I would understand it in the future.

355
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,390
But,

356
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,750
how do I know if I feel affection?

357
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,390
Affection?

358
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,510
I think it's about

359
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,080
wanting to be with him all the time.

360
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,040
If you don't see him for a while,

361
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,230
you will start to miss him.

362
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,870
You're awake.

363
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,080
We trained so hard.

364
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,110
You should sleep more.

365
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,840
Where's Dai Mu Bai?

366
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,150
You see that?

367
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,390
She's already missing him.

368
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,470
Sister Qing, you feel affection for Brother Dai?

369
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
Nonsense, I don't.

370
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,750
You don't?

371
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,979
You looked for him the moment you woke up.

372
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,350
I'm just worried about him.

373
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,350
Why are you worrying?

374
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,350
You haven't seen him for a while,

375
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,390
and you're already worried?

376
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,200
It's you?

377
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,560
You're useless.

378
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,080
It took you a long time to wake
from being manipulated.

379
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,840
Looks like your departure from home

380
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
is a meaningless act.

381
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,990
Don't worry.

382
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,390
I'll bring you home once I kill her.

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,270
Coward.

384
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,230
The game is over.

385
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,560
Your death will be quick.

386
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't worry.

387
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,800
It won't hurt.

388
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,600
Dai Mu Bai.

389
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,840
You must work with me.

390
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,200
Otherwise, we'll both die here.

391
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,990
Why would I kill my beloved brother?

392
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I am the direct disciple
of the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

393
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,960
The chief of Martial Soul Hall is your master?

394
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,960
That's right.

395
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,840
That's great.

396
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,870
I'd really like to see

397
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,720
the blood of the disciple
of the Greatest Soul Master in Douluo Continent.

398
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
What color would it be?

399
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,990
Are you alright, Brother Dai?

400
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Your Blue Silver Plant is interesting.

401
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,080
Both of you, run away. I'll stop him.

402
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,920
None of you can escape.

403
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,840
Can you use White Tiger Intense Light Wave again?

404
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,320
It's useless against him.

405
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,150
How can you know?

406
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,230
What did you do to me?

407
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,470
You protected me

408
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,350
even when you lost your awareness.

409
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,470
I'm truly grateful.

410
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,080
Thank you.

411
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,800
You're lying!

412
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,840
Use White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

413
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,200
We'll solve the problem once and for all.

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Really?

415
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm waiting.

416
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,800
It needs to be a delayed outburst.

417
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,990
Trust me!

418
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,320
I've scheduled their training
for the next few days.

419
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,350
But it still lacks actual combat experience.

420
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,920
Why don't we

421
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,990
let them go back to battle in the Soul Arena?

422
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,270
We can consider that,

423
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,937
but their opponents may not be strong enough.

424
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,750
White Tiger Intense Light Wave!
White Tiger Intense Light Wave!

425
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,440
What's the point of letting it explode in the air?

426
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,600
It's a warning.

427
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
Headmaster, he wants to kill us.

428
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,960
Seven Soul Rings.

429
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,720
You're a Soul Saint?

430
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,200
Don't kill him, Headmaster.

431
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,350
He's my brother.

432
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,080
Why are you here in Tian Dou Empire?

433
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,600
Seems like you know who I am.

434
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,280
I don't care who you are.

435
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,990
You're not allowed to harm my students.

436
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,150
I can spare them,

437
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,800
but I have to bring my brother back.

438
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,320
No way.

439
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,040
What if he's willing to go back with me?

440
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,920
Tell him, Dai Mu Bai.

441
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,600
Are you coming back with me?

442
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,630
I'll go with you.

443
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,230
Brother Dai, you're willing to go with him?

444
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,150
If I go against him,

445
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,800
the school will get into serious trouble.

446
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,750
I'm asking you
if you're really willing to go with him!

447
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,720
So what if I'm unwilling to go?

448
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,870
You cannot even imagine

449
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,990
the force behind him.

450
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,870
Then we'll face it together.

451
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
Even though Shi Lan Ke is small,

452
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,390
we're not afraid of danger.

453
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,390
We will fight together on your side.

454
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,200
Fight together?

455
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,870
How many students do you have in your school?

456
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,270
Seven!

457
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,630
You only have seven students at school?

458
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,870
Dai Mu Bai.

459
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,630
It seems that after you left home,

460
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,040
you haven't improved enough

461
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,230
to be able to change your fate.

462
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,600
But right now,

463
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,920
I can still give you a chance.

464
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,720
I heard

465
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,630
that your records
in Suo Tuo Soul Arena are quite good.

466
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,470
I'll give you five days.

467
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,510
After five days,

468
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,560
we meet in the Soul Arena.

469
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
All seven of you against me.

470
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,840
If you can defeat me,

471
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,510
you don't have to go with me.

472
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,110
But if you lose,

473
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,510
Shi Lan Ke School

474
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,350
should cease to exist!

475
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,720
No way!

476
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,230
Sure.

477
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,720
Headmaster.

478
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,080
I trust all of you.

479
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,320
You will know

480
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,870
that number is meaningless!

481
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,150
No matter how many of you are there,

482
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,350
you're still just insects.

483
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,680
Tang San, Tang San.

484
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,560
You were fighting.

485
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,270
Why didn't you tell me?

486
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll definitely tell you next time.

487
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,110
I heard Brother Dai was there too.

488
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Where is he?

489
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,510
He's with Headmaster.

490
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,990
You just arrived. You're leaving?

491
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,470
Sister Qing was worried
about us walking at night.

492
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,720
So she accompanied us here.

493
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,110
But our dorms are close to each other.

494
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,720
Besides, Sister Wu, you're good at fighting.

495
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,840
Shouldn't she

496
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,560
worry about the one beaten up by you instead?

497
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
You said "us".

498
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,600
Is Rong Rong coming too?

499
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,870
Wu!

500
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,870
Why did both of you walk so fast,

501
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,920
and didn't wait for me?

502
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,350
Why did Sister Qing leave?

503
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,110
Take a seat.

504
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,390
Did I miss anything?

505
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,600
It's...

506
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,320
I'll tell you.

507
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,840
This is the situation now.

508
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,270
Brother Dai has an elder brother

509
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,920
called Dai Wei Shi.

510
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,470
One word to describe him.

511
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,750
It's "mad", you know?

512
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,630
He's basically the advanced version
of Brother Dai.

513
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
He challenged us

514
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,470
to a battle.

515
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,080
All seven of us against him alone.

516
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,390
He's that mad?

517
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,870
He's even madder than Brother Dai!

518
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,470
Exactly!

519
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,800
They're truly biological brothers.

520
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,750
How many Soul Rings does he have?

521
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,960
Brother Dai said

522
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,771
he has four.

523
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,200
Quadruple Soul Rings Soul Honour.

524
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,600
Sounds pretty strong.

525
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,150
But with the seven of us against him,

526
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,270
we should be able to win.

527
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Brother Dai also said

528
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,040
Dai Wei Shi is extremely strong.

529
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,720
His strength cannot be compared

530
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,604
with normal Soul Honours.

531
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,470
Here. This is the medicine I made.

532
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,320
Drink it up.

533
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,920
Thank you.

534
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,040
Mu Bai.

535
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,080
You said Hu Lie Na had asked you out

536
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,040
and used a spiritual attack on you?

537
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,560
Yes.

538
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,680
When I regained my awareness,

539
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,270
my brother was already there.

540
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,320
Explain it to me.

541
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,350
I asked Brother Dai out

542
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,720
because I like him.

543
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,080
Do you need to use a spiritual attack
on him if you like him?

544
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,110
I didn't do it on purpose.

545
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
His brother suddenly appeared from the back,

546
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,470
and I thought it was an ambush,

547
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,350
so I retaliated.

548
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,040
It was an accidental hit on Brother Dai.

549
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,960
Then about my Soul Skill,

550
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,840
how do you explain that?

551
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,680
You even used your power to manipulate him?

552
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,750
If I were really that capable,

553
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,680
I would use it on his brother.

554
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,560
Wouldn't it be fine?

555
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
I'd make him return to where he came from.

556
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,470
Why would I manipulate Brother Dai?

557
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,600
Gang.

558
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,080
It's true that she doesn't have the capability.

559
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,110
She may have used a special tool.

560
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,230
Hand it to us.

561
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,800
What?

562
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
During the fight, you said

563
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,870
you were the direct disciple
of the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

564
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,560
With that identity,

565
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,080
it's normal that you have a tool like that.

566
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:21,870
I don't have such a tool.

567
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,150
You don't trust me?

568
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,750
You can search my body.

569
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,920
Brother Dai.

570
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,750
Are you mad at me?

571
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,920
I apologize.

572
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm willing

573
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
to fight together with you five days later.

574
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,350
You're not a student of Shi Lan Ke.

575
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,479
Why do you have to fight?

576
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,720
I like you.

577
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm willing to help you.

578
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,750
I came to Shi Lan Ke because of you.

579
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,800
This is a fight for Shi Lan Ke School.

580
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,350
The attached student doesn't need to go.

581
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
His brother is so strong.

582
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,680
I have Triple Soul Rings.

583
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,230
I can help.

584
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,680
No need.

585
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,390
You heard him.

586
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,870
I want to create

587
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,270
a team that can trust each other.

588
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,200
Unfortunately, you are not qualified.

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,110
Why?

590
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
Just because I like Dai Mu Bai,

591
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
but didn't express it?

592
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
Who you like is your own business.

593
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,870
But in Shi Lan Ke,

594
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,920
who do you trust? Who believes you?

595
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,990
If you are unwilling to trust in this team,

596
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,920
then the team does not need you, either.

597
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:19,960
Whatever.

598
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm leaving.

599
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Wait!

600
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,470
What do you want?

601
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,230
Dai Mu Bai, I have something to tell her.

602
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,390
You may leave.

603
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,200
Since our trip to the Star Forest,

604
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,560
a lot of things have happened,

605
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,920
and I haven't had time

606
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,750
to properly speak with you.

607
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
What do we have to talk about?

608
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,840
Was Su Yun Tao always around?

609
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,800
He was protecting you.

610
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,750
No such thing.

611
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,150
He's dead.

612
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,680
What?

613
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,510
In the Star Forest,

614
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,270
I saw someone kill him.

615
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,200
Nonsense!

616
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,870
Who killed him?

617
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,870
It was a shadow.

618
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,720
What kind of answer is that?

619
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,630
Even though I couldn't see the face,

620
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,960
I've been speculating for the past few days.

621
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,200
Why did the killer want to kill Su Yun Tao?

622
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,840
Do you have an answer?

623
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,920
In the Star Forest,

624
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,390
the killer was meeting up
with the Azure Bull Python.

625
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,920
The King of Star Forest?

626
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,470
Su Yun Tao was killed

627
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,870
probably because

628
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,630
their meeting was a secret.

629
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,720
But the problem is

630
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,230
that the shadow's face couldn't be seen.

631
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,630
How could Su Yun Tao reveal the secret?

632
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,870
You mean

633
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,390
that the killer is likely

634
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,800
to be someone he is familiar with?

635
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,470
That's right.

636
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,870
This is the only reason to kill Su Yun Tao.

637
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,230
Su Yun Tao has no family members.

638
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,560
He has been living in Martial Soul Hall.

639
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,560
If the killer is someone he's familiar with,

640
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,510
it might be someone from Martial Soul Hall.

641
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,630
These are just my speculations.

642
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,320
I told you

643
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,390
because you were fighting

644
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,870
alongside Tang San earlier.

645
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,510
Thank you.

646
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,440
It's nothing.

647
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,990
You can go.

648
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,440
You're using Hu Lie Na

649
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,270
to warn the chief of Martial Soul Hall.

650
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Am I right?

651
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,720
Chief.

652
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,990
An officer from Martial Soul Hall told me

653
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,990
that you wanted to see me.

654
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,630
Su Yun Tao

655
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,350
was killed in the Star Forest.

656
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,990
Su Yun Tao is dead,

657
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,080
but she is still in Shi Lan Ke School.

658
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,800
Take care of her for me.

659
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,110
Make sure she doesn't cause trouble.

660
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,510
Me?

661
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,840
You'd better not cause trouble, either.

662
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,840
Chief.

663
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,270
You must have heard

664
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,350
of what happened last night.

665
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
We still have five days.

666
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,600
If we lose the battle,

667
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,270
Dai Mu Bai will be taken away.

668
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,960
If any one of you is unwilling to participate,

669
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,200
you can quit now.

670
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,720
After all, I accepted

671
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,230
the duel with Dai Wei Shi for you.

672
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,800
It's just a fight.
The seven of us will definitely win.

673
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,870
Master.

674
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,350
Are we starting our training now?

675
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,920
For the next few days,

676
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,230
you will be training separately.

677
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
Shouldn't we train together?

678
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,630
There are only five days left.

679
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,990
We don't have enough time
to develop your teamwork.

680
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,110
It's better to make each of you stronger.

681
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,630
Wu, Zhu Zhu Qing.

682
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,390
Follow Headmaster to the forest out of town.

683
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,390
He will train both of you.

684
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,600
The rest.

685
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,350
I have special training for you.

686
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,840
I know both of you have great speed.

687
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:11,990
Now,

688
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,920
I want to see how fast you can get.

689
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,960
As soon as you touch me,

690
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
you pass.

691
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,720
I'm not done yet.

692
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I can't go beyond the range of the bell.

693
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,320
I am not allowed to ring the bell either.

694
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,840
What about us?

695
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,230
Both of you have no restrictions.

696
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,680
Are you done?

697
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,510
Done.

698
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,750
Don't forget your Martial Soul.

699
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Gang.

700
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,200
You're saying

701
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,150
that the training is just a trap?

702
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,630
Not for them to increase their power.

703
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,270
That's right.

704
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,080
No one can really improve

705
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,750
in just five days.

706
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,630
Then why are you lying to them?

707
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm not lying. I'm guiding.

708
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,920
How so?

709
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,470
They're still young.

710
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,350
Just having enthusiasm and passion
is not enough.

711
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,680
So this training

712
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,560
is to change their attitude.

713
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,870
First, use my way

714
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,320
to let them discover their own weaknesses.

715
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,990
When they want to make up
for their flaws themselves,

716
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,920
we can train them
according to their aptitudes

717
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,150
and teach them step by step

718
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,646
how to develop their skills.

719
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,230
Let me think about it.

720
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,440
So you're saying,

721
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,560
through our guidance,

722
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,960
they'll change from passively accepting

723
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,720
to actively discovering the truth.

724
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,187
Know one's strength and make up for one's weakness.

725
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,800
That's right.

726
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,560
This doesn't make sense.

727
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,200
Why don't you

728
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,230
just tell them their weaknesses?

729
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,270
Wouldn't it speed up

730
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,230
their understanding?

731
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,110
Sometimes, it's harder for people to accept

732
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,440
what others tell them.

733
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,350
If they can discover their weaknesses

734
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,080
during the training,

735
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,750
and learn to think,

736
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,271
that is the most valuable experience
a Soul Master can have.

737
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,960
Amazing, Gang.

738
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,510
You really deserve to be

739
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,470
Douluo Continent's number one

740
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,390
in Martial Soul theory.

741
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,080
To have a teacher like you

742
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,270
in Shi Lan Ke School.

743
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,110
Next semester,

744
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,630
I can increase the school fees!

745
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,600
Tuition has increased.

746
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,800
Headmaster, why are you smiling?

747
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,440
What's it about increasing school fees?

748
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
No, no, no. It's nothing.

749
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,150
What are you waiting for? Continue your training.

750
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,840
To reminder both of you.

751
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,200
Be aware

752
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,200
of your surroundings.

753
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,150
Come.

754
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,150
Dai Mu Bai, Tang San, Ma Hong Jun.

755
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,080
Tell me your Soul Skills one by one.

756
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,630
Triple Soul Rings.

757
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,440
White Tiger Protection Barrier.

758
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,440
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

759
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,320
White Tiger Vajra Transformation.

760
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,120
Triple Soul Rings.

761
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,040
Intertwine.

762
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,800
Parasite.

763
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,640
Constraint of Spider Web.

764
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,590
I never thought of the names.

765
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,430
Basically,

766
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,280
one lets my fingers release fire.

767
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,070
Another

768
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,950
lets the flame grow stronger.

769
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,310
Then why don't we call them Phoenix Firing Line

770
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,680
and Fiery Phoenix?

771
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,190
Do you know how to use your Soul Skills?

772
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,350
Of course!

773
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,520
Have you ever tried

774
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,120
using White Tiger Protection Barrier

775
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,520
and White Tiger Vajra Transformation
at the same time?

776
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,590
Then simultaneously release
White Tiger Intense Light Wave.

777
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,760
Use three Soul Skills together?

778
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,280
Never thought about it?

779
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,470
Try it.

780
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,950
How is it?

781
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,760
It exhausts my strength quickly.

782
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,920
This is the most exhausting training method.

783
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,550
But it's also the most effective.

784
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,040
All three of you,

785
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,000
try to use your Soul Skills mixedly.

786
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,350
Direct all your attacks to this boulder.

787
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,200
Just like this? What's next?

788
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,270
Continue hitting it. Don't stop.

789
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,790
Before I return,

790
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,990
none of you can stop.

791
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,400
You two, follow me.

792
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:40,960
Brother Dai.

793
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,750
Let's do this.

794
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,160
Ou Si Ke.

795
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,960
I've heard that you don't want to be a Soul Master.

796
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:09,990
Yeah.

797
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,030
My dream is to spread arts.

798
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,960
I want to join a troupe.

799
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,240
I want to write my own plays and act them out.

800
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,120
Why do you not want to be a Soul Master?

801
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,350
My Martial Soul is too embarrassing.

802
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
Idiot, your Martial Soul is unique.

803
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,310
Others' Martial Souls are used for combat.

804
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,480
My Martial Soul only makes food with a bucket.

805
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,750
Why do you have to fight?

806
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,590
Isn't it good enough to stand behind others

807
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,030
and let them protect you?

808
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,440
But I'm a man.

809
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,510
This is my Martial Soul.

810
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,920
I'm actually like you.

811
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,920
When people attack,

812
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I can only watch by their side.
