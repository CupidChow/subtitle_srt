=Episode 13=

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,550
What about him?

15
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,480
It's impossible that he's stronger than me!

16
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,840
You're strong.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,630
I'm not stronger than you.

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,910
Your Martial Soul...

19
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,400
must be the Qibao Amber Pagoda.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,440
If he is a Soul Master

21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,550
in the Support Branch like me,

22
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,720
I don't think
there's a Support Branch Martial Soul

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,120
that can be stronger than the Qibao Amber Pagoda!

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,400
Indeed.

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,400
The Qibao Amber Pagoda

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
is one of the strongest Martial Souls
in the Support Branch.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,000
However, the Soul Master's strength

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,729
takes precedence
over the Martial Soul's quality.

29
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,640
Other than Tang San,

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,670
Ou Si Ke is the most gifted here.

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,200
His talent alone ranks above Dai Mu Bai.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,430
What makes you so sure?

33
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,870
When your Martial Soul awakened,

34
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,950
how strong was your Soul Power?

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,840
Level Nine.

36
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,560
Have you heard of
people born with full Soul Power?

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
The Support Branch...

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,230
has never seen...

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,360
anyone born with full Soul Power.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,510
The person right in front of you is one.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,670
He is the first one

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,000
in the Support Branch's history!

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,040
Every student here

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,710
is brighter than you.

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,790
How can you be proud?

46
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,790
If you can't accept it,

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,640
it's alright.

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,710
Since you are neither gifted

49
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,760
nor perseverant,

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
just pack up and leave.

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,430
Go back to your Qibao Amber Clan.

52
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,360
Go to your father and complain about it.

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,150
You...

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
I won't give up!

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,590
Rong Rong!

56
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,000
You have all witnessed

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,950
what happened with Ning Rong Rong.

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,040
If you want to continue your training,

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,480
you must follow the school's rules.

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,200
Your lessons

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,510
will be extremely tough and painful.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,070
If you don't think you can take it,

63
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,150
you can drop out now.

64
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,400
Alright, dismiss.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
See you tomorrow.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,430
Bye.

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,870
Headmaster!

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,070
Headmaster!

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,510
Brother Dai.

70
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,790
Where are you going?

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,560
Suo Tuo City.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,150
You're going to the city now?

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,230
Keep it down!

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,479
Don't let Headmaster hear it.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
What are you doing there?

76
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,000
The Soul Arena Competition.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
You've joined the competition?

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,040
How can I become stronger

79
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,040
if I don't challenge myself?

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,480
Can I go?

81
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,310
You go?

82
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,270
Why would you go?

83
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,080
The village head mentioned

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
that Bu Le might be there.

85
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,550
Didn't Headmaster say

86
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,680
that it was dangerous,

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,830
and we shouldn't get involved?

88
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,990
Had it not been for Bu Le,

89
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,390
my dad wouldn't have died.

90
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,240
Alright, alright.

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,870
Hurry.

92
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,729
Don't let Headmaster see us.

93
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,990
Master.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,550
Headmaster.

95
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,990
Master,

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,640
what are you reading?

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
"The Principles of Soul Burst"?

98
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,110
This book has become popular recently.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I heard that the author

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,270
even won a prize.

101
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,870
But in my opinion,

102
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,680
your theories and research

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,310
are profounder than this book.

104
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,760
Why don't you write a book too, Master?

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
Stop disturbing him, Ou Si Ke.

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,310
I'm not disturbing him.

107
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,920
Give me!

108
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,990
I'm here to help.

109
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
You're helping me?

110
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
Why does it seem

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,710
that you are asking me for help instead?

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,710
Headmaster, you're wise.

113
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,430
You can see through everything.

114
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,680
What do you want?

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,080
Well...

116
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,390
Can Rong Rong stay?

117
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,040
You're pleading for Ning Rong Rong?

118
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,200
Yes.

119
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,960
She's just young and rash,

120
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,760
and maybe a little bad-tempered.

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Won't you just forgive her, please?

122
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,430
Please?

123
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,710
That little girl...

124
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,150
If she hadn't stood up for you earlier

125
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,520
when I was punishing you,

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
then I would definitely have given up on her.

127
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,800
It may seem

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
that she's rather arrogant,

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,200
but she's not a bad person.

130
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
You mean

131
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,240
that she can stay?

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
That's up to her.

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,830
Aren't you going to comfort her now?

134
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,270
Alright!

135
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,990
Also...

136
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,710
Forget about the 20 laps.

137
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,830
Thank you, Headmaster!

138
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,990
Oh yeah.

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,760
There's one more thing.

140
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,870
Ma Hong Jun...

141
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,040
When he goes berserk,

142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,430
his crimson flames

143
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,310
is very powerful.

144
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,390
Its heat is really intense,

145
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,960
and it's adhesive,

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,110
making it really hard to extinguish.

147
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,110
What's more,

148
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,040
his flames

149
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,520
won't burn

150
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,200
his clothes or hair.

151
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
Everything apart from him

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
will be burned to ashes.

153
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,870
His Martial Soul is a Mutant Soul,

154
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,870
the Evil Phoenix.

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,710
Normally,

156
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,830
when a Martial Soul mutates,

157
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,830
there are only two circumstances.

158
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,310
One, it will grow weaker,

159
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,550
and the Soul Master

160
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,360
will have to suffer the consequences.

161
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,680
Two, it will become stronger.

162
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,200
Even though Ma Hong Jun's mutation

163
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,520
is positive,

164
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
the strengthened Soul Power

165
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,390
brought about by the mutation

166
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,310
affects his body.

167
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,800
That is why he cannot

168
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,310
control the evil flames well.

169
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,080
I didn't witness

170
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,040
his mutation process,

171
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,430
but according to what Boss Lan said,

172
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,640
the reason why the flames

173
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
don't burn Ma Hong Jun

174
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,480
is due to his father.

175
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,040
His dad?

176
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,200
His dad didn't leave him anything.

177
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,150
Everything he has

178
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,390
was given by my dad.

179
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,830
It's not a matter of substance.

180
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,710
It's love.

181
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,040
His father should also know

182
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,550
the Evil Phoenix's weakness after mutation.

183
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,590
That's why he chose to sacrifice himself,

184
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,150
burning his own power.

185
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,200
His love turned into a protective umbrella.

186
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,640
Even though

187
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,240
Ma Hong Jun is unable

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,590
to control the Phoenix Soul,

189
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,310
he is safe from harm.

190
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
A father's love is great.

191
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,430
Amazing theory, Gang.

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,640
Amazing?

193
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,800
A pay raise?

194
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,150
What?

195
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,080
Why don't you give me some paternal love?

196
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,590
What about a better supper tonight?

197
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,550
You're getting bolder, you little brat?

198
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,990
Do you want to run those 20 laps?

199
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,710
No, no!

200
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,270
Bye, Dad!

201
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,920
Bye, Master!

202
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,480
Rong Rong.

203
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,960
Rong Rong.

204
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,990
Headmaster was a little harsh,

205
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,240
but don't keep it in mind.

206
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,870
Why won't you say something?

207
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,110
Don't be too hard on yourself.

208
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Don't be rash.

209
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,240
Why don't you open the door?

210
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,390
Rong Rong!

211
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,760
If you don't open the door,

212
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm going to barge in!

213
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,310
Rong Rong!

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm totally fine.

215
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,950
It doesn't hurt at all.

216
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,630
Why do you come to see me?

217
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,590
I've spoken with Headmaster.

218
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,360
You can stay.

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,510
You can continue your studies here.

220
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,630
Who says I'm leaving?

221
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,920
That's great!

222
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,150
As long as I'm here,

223
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,360
everything will be alright.

224
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,710
I'll take care of you.

225
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,680
Boastful.

226
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,510
Were you really born with full Soul Power?

227
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,240
But that thing about being the first in history...

228
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,510
I'm not that good.

229
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
You're a Support Branch Soul Master?

230
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,880
Kind of.

231
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,150
Oh yeah.

232
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,270
I still haven't seen your Martial Soul.

233
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,630
I...

234
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,070
There's nothing special about mine.

235
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,800
This is my Martial Soul.

236
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,880
Qibao Amber Pagoda.

237
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,104
There are seven levels, one for each Soul Ring.

238
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,360
I only have two Soul Rings now.

239
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,320
So I can only use the power of the first two levels.

240
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,830
Qibao Boosts.

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,880
First, Strength.

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm feeling stronger all over my body.

243
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,750
It's so much lighter.

244
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
The table didn't get lighter.

245
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,240
You got stronger.

246
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,150
Really?

247
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,830
And there's the Second Soul Skill.

248
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,880
Second, Speed.

249
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm not feeling anything.

250
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,440
Try running.

251
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,920
This speed is really high.

252
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm feeling a little...

253
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,750
a little dizzy.

254
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,150
It's your turn.

255
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,150
Me?

256
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,590
Show me your Martial Soul.

257
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,270
My Martial Soul?

258
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,390
It's really nothing.

259
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,680
Are you looking down on me?

260
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,800
Of course not!

261
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,120
Then show me!

262
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,150
Let's not do it. It's awkward.

263
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,710
Are you saying I'm not good enough to see it?

264
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,950
No.

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,800
I...

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
If you don't show me your Martial Soul,

267
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,880
get out!

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,270
No...

269
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,950
Alright, alright.

270
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,630
I'll show you.

271
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,710
I'll show you, alright?

272
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,560
But first things first,

273
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,360
don't laugh at me.

274
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,680
Sure.

275
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,190
I'm telling you, you can't laugh.

276
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,750
Why are you such a nag?

277
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,070
I already promised you.

278
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,830
This is your Martial Soul?

279
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,390
Enough.

280
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Get some rest.

281
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
If you get exhausted tonight

282
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
and can't finish

283
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,710
the lessons tomorrow,

284
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,440
I won't give you a refund.

285
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
I don't want money.

286
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,830
I want to win.

287
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,830
Since you've paid double tuition,

288
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,560
I'll give you some advice for free.

289
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,560
Sometimes,

290
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,630
victory may not be a good thing.

291
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
Perhaps this is not what you want to hear.

292
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
But who do you really want to defeat?

293
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,000
Your opponent?

294
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,240
In my opinion,

295
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,040
the greatest opponent

296
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,880
one has to face in life is one's self.

297
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,680
It's the enemy.

298
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,920
How do you define an enemy?

299
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,270
How do you determine whether
a person is an enemy or a friend?

300
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,920
A person who did something wrong

301
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,630
may not be a bad person for life.

302
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,270
But...

303
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,120
Enough.

304
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I've given you enough advice.

305
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,150
Think it through.

306
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,000
Determine what you really want.

307
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
I need to go back and think about

308
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,040
whom I should bet on
in the Soul Arena Competition.

309
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,830
After all, there's only one chance.

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
We can't change the outcome.

311
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,750
So I really need to be serious

312
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,920
and think it through before I place my bets.

313
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,800
Right?

314
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,830
Rest early.

315
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,360
Thank you.

316
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,120
The Soul Arena Badge

317
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,710
shows that you're a competitor.

318
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,880
Do I need this to enter the arena?

319
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,630
Then...

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Brother Dai, do you come here often

321
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,830
to battle against others?

322
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,630
Of course.

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,150
Then I want to sign up too!

324
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,880
Calm down, Wu.

325
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,070
Remember

326
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,070
for what reason

327
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,880
we came here.

328
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,590
Support Ma Hong Jun in the competition

329
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,830
and see if we can find Bu Le.

330
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,630
Exactly.

331
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,070
Alright, I'll listen to you.

332
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,270
Thank you, everyone.

333
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,440
Don't thank me.

334
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,937
I'm not getting involved in your matters.

335
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm going in.

336
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,320
What about me?

337
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,440
Just do what you did at the Nightfire Village.

338
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,440
Release your Martial Soul once you're up there.

339
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,510
But... I'm afraid I won't be able to control it.

340
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,320
It's alright.

341
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,950
Being uncontrollable

342
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,710
is the trait of a Mutant Soul.

343
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,680
If Bu Le is around,

344
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,270
he will definitely see you.

345
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,320
Both of us

346
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,750
stay here to keep watch.

347
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
We'll see if anyone
is paying attention to Ma Hong Jun.

348
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,590
Then we'll capture him!

349
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,240
No.

350
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,000
We can't make our move here.

351
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,270
Our mission is

352
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,830
to find our target and follow him.

353
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,270
Then we'll capture him!

354
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,510
Yes, you got it this time.

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Then we'll come back to join the competition.

356
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,680
I've already thought of our alias.

357
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,800
We're the San Woo.

358
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,120
How is it? Sounds great, right?

359
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
Alright, you should go.

360
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,510
Competitors in this round,

361
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,070
please go to Arena Eight immediately.

362
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,390
It's there.

363
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,560
Wu, over there.

364
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Competitors,

365
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,270
please go to Arena Eight immediately.

366
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,000
Coming, coming!

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,830
Excuse me, excuse me.

368
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,560
Thank you.

369
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,510
Here.

370
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,120
This way.

371
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,000
Are you taking part?

372
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,150
No, not me.

373
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,630
Him.

374
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,120
I...

375
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,710
Badge.

376
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,950
Get ready to enter the arena.

377
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,830
Do your best, Hong Jun.

378
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,560
Battle, start!

379
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,070
Release my Martial Soul.

380
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,150
Release my Martial Soul.

381
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,510
Release my Martial Soul.

382
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,710
I give in!

383
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,000
I surrender! I surrender.

384
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,800
I need to pay?

385
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,120
You destroyed our facilities,

386
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,390
and also hurt the judge.

387
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,560
Even the judge got burnt by me?

388
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,440
But... I don't have money.

389
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,360
Can we use his prize money

390
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,150
to pay?

391
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,600
A single match's prize money is not enough.

392
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,630
This guy again? He's too strong.

393
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,200
Don't get too close.

394
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,630
He'd even attack the audience.

395
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,320
Be careful.

396
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,150
We have to watch out.

397
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,800
Be careful.

398
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,630
Careful.

399
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,720
Move!

400
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
Watch where you're going!

401
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,840
Boss Bu Le.

402
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,870
A Mutant Soul has appeared at the Soul Arena.

403
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,110
What Martial Soul?

404
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,230
Body covered in flames.

405
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,080
Sometimes, a shadow would appear behind him.

406
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,150
Like a bird.

407
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,960
Evil Phoenix?

408
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,750
The Nightfire Village...

409
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,750
really had a Mutant Soul?

410
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,720
He's still there.

411
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,230
Do you want to take a look?

412
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,230
Tian Ya.

413
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,680
Don't be rash.

414
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,200
He just came out.

415
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,840
Be patient.

416
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,750
Let's see what he can do.

417
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,990
We must confirm that he is strong enough

418
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,630
before we inform the higher-ups.

419
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,390
Borrow money?

420
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,750
We have to pay
for the ruined stage and medical costs.

421
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,150
Didn't he win a few matches?

422
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
He should have money.

423
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,960
Someone got hurt in every match.

424
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,320
His prize money isn't enough to cover the losses.

425
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,320
We've already used up all our money.

426
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,350
Don't worry, Brother Dai.

427
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,720
We'll definitely pay you back soon.

428
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,040
How do you plan to do it?

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
With the little money you earn
at the ironsmith shop?

430
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,840
I'm not doing it for you.

431
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,680
If you go out and work,

432
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,150
nobody will take care of this kid.

433
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
You can pay me back when you've found Bu Le.

434
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,960
Thank you.

435
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,320
Thank you, Brother Dai.

436
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Are you going to continue battling tonight?

437
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,270
It's getting late.

438
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,960
And Bu Le didn't appear.

439
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,920
We should go back to school.

440
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,600
All of you must keep it a secret.

441
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
We must not let Headmaster find this out.

442
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,510
Don't worry! We won't say anything.

443
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,440
Let's go.

444
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,390
Okay!

445
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,390
You're getting bolder!

446
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,229
Going to the Soul Arena

447
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,396
in the middle of the night to fight!

448
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,750
I didn't.

449
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,440
Look at this!

450
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,800
He's quite tough.

451
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,630
He's got exposed and he's still so calm!

452
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,080
Wait, who told you

453
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,040
that we had gone to the Soul Arena?

454
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,870
It's already printed on the local Soul Master tab.

455
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,750
Read it yourself!

456
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,750
"Last night a fiery devil appeared
in the Soul Arena,

457
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:04,920
fighting and burning things.

458
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,470
The stage was in a mess."

459
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,440
"Flame Soul

460
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,800
that almost never appeared

461
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
suddenly appeared last night."

462
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,800
Ma Hong Jun!

463
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,800
Are you saying it wasn't you?

464
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,920
It was me.

465
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,080
What is this?

466
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,960
I went there by myself.

467
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,390
It has nothing to do with them.

468
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,600
Nothing to do with them?

469
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,510
Me.

470
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,960
I went with Hong Jun.

471
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,630
I know nothing,

472
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,560
Nothing?

473
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,080
If you know nothing,

474
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,150
why would I ask you to come?

475
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,470
Without you,

476
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,920
how would they even find their way
to the Soul Arena?

477
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,470
Do you really think I'm not aware that you've been

478
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,230
going to the Soul Arena secretly?

479
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Since you know about it,

480
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,720
I admit.

481
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,350
Haven't I told all of you

482
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,840
that this is a complicated matter,

483
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,680
and you must not get involved?

484
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,560
Headmaster.

485
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,150
I'm willing to drop out of school.

486
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,080
Are you going to throw a tantrum?

487
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,960
No.

488
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,470
Looking for Bu Le is my own business.

489
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,870
I can't implicate the others.

490
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,150
If I drop out of school,

491
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,990
no matter what trouble I get into,

492
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,840
everyone here will be fine.

493
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,990
Thank you for taking care of me, Headmaster.

494
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,720
Please don't blame Brother San and the others

495
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,200
for the mistakes I've made.

496
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,110
What is it? Being the hero?

497
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,840
No, Headmaster.

498
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,230
I just don't want to cause any more trouble

499
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,230
to the people around me.

500
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,560
Headmaster.

501
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,320
I'll take my leave now.

502
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,560
What about the tuition you owe me?

503
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,200
We had a deal.

504
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
You'll pay me back with the money
you earn after you graduate.

505
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,600
If you leave now,

506
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
what about my money?

507
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,510
No way.

508
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,510
You cannot leave.

509
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,630
Also, from now on,

510
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,230
nobody is allowed to go to the Soul Arena.

511
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,840
Real battles are the best training

512
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,600
a Soul Master can have.

513
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,350
Calm down.

514
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,320
In my opinion,

515
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,840
you can continue to battle in the Soul Arena.

516
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,440
But there's a condition.

517
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,560
If Bu Le comes to Ma Hong Jun again,

518
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,470
you must inform us.

519
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,960
The school will be responsible
for everything that happens next.

520
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,760
Is that alright?

521
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,630
Okay!

522
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,270
Ma Hong Jun.

523
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
How do you feel

524
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,800
after the matches last night?

525
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm still unable to control my own Martial Soul.

526
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,680
That's why we have to train you.

527
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,630
You need to figure out

528
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,604
how to control your Martial Soul.

529
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800
Dai Mu Bai, help him with the training.

530
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,920
Why me?

531
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,560
You brought them to the Soul Arena.

532
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,390
This is a little punishment.

533
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,350
Besides, you're the team's captain.

534
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,630
Who else could it be?

535
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,960
Slowly.

536
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,150
Increase your strength

537
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,510
while keeping yourself at peace.

538
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,270
Release it when you've found the balance.

539
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,040
Conscious?

540
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,270
Yes.

541
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,230
Again.

542
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,920
That's the consequence

543
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,040
if you can't control it.

544
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,510
Hong Jun.

545
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,270
Are you alright?

546
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,960
Again!

547
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,470
Gang.

548
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,920
Are you really allowing them

549
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,150
to continue battling?

550
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
It's right to gain more experience

551
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,320
with real fights.

552
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Also, they can meet

553
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
different types of Soul Masters
in the Soul Arena.

554
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,040
It'll be helpful.

555
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,150
Seems like you're letting them learn on their own.

556
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,920
Didn't you know from the start

557
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,440
that Dai Mu Bai had been battling?

558
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,150
Why haven't you stopped him?

559
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,150
I'm just giving him

560
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,510
a chance to train.

561
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,230
I heard that there's betting

562
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,350
for every match in the Soul Arena.

563
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,510
Really?

564
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,920
Isn't this a betting ticket?

565
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,960
You even bet on Dai Mu Bai.

566
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,960
Dai Mu Bai is very strong.

567
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,150
I just place a bet sometimes

568
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,990
to help with the school fees.

569
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,320
Don't tell anyone.

570
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,630
You're a teacher!

571
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,146
We'll resume tomorrow.

572
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,390
Brother Dai.

573
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Thank you for training Hong Jun seriously.

574
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:23,960
Don't thank me.

575
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm just following

576
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Headmaster's orders.

577
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,750
Moreover,

578
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
it's not an option.

579
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
This guy will borrow money from me

580
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,470
each time he burns someone.

581
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,440
If he doesn't control it,

582
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,470
I'm going to be broke.

583
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,870
I did it.

584
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,150
I'm conscious.

585
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,560
I've succeeded!

586
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
Get up, Hong Jun.

587
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,080
You were

588
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
in a conscious state of mind

589
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,110
when you controlled the flames.

590
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
You've improved, Hong Jun.

591
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,110
Again!

592
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,800
Again!

593
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,080
I still can't do it.

594
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,440
Close your eyes.

595
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,200
Imagine that there's a scale within you.

596
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,230
Mental strength on one side,
Martial Soul on the other.

597
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
Use your mind to balance them.

598
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,040
Don't try too hard.

599
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,560
You have to relax to find your balance.

600
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,150
I've succeeded.

601
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,510
Now try using a Soul Skill.

602
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,230
Continue.

603
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,080
Make sure he remembers his condition.

604
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,630
Are you alright?

605
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,230
Why are you hitting him again?

606
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,510
What's that?

607
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,150
The lunch is ready.

608
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,840
We made porridge.

609
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Hurry and eat it

610
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,750
before it gets cold.

611
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,630
Where are you going?

612
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
This is for Rong Rong.

613
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
What happened to her legs?

614
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,270
Can't she get it herself?

615
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,600
It's alright.

616
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,720
This is no big deal.

617
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,080
Have fun. I'm off.

618
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,920
Continue.

619
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,470
Wait.

620
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,270
What is it now?

621
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,750
It's not good without pickles.

622
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Continue training, continue.

623
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,840
Bye!

624
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,510
Let's wait for a bit.

625
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,600
Sister Qing, let's eat together.

626
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,110
Yeah, that's right.

627
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,800
Let's eat together.

628
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,600
I can

629
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,800
go to the canteen myself.

630
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,230
Here you go.

631
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,630
If you're unhappy with it,

632
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,990
you don't have to bring me food next time.

633
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,870
I'm not.

634
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,720
I'm doing this willingly.

635
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,040
You're my junior.

636
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,440
This...

637
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,720
This is what I should do.

638
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,510
What happened outside?

639
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,440
Why is it so noisy?

640
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,920
Outside?

641
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,270
Brother Dai is training Ma Hong Jun.

642
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,390
He's helping him to control his Martial Soul.

643
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,150
He got splashed with water, and got beaten up.

644
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,720
That poor thing.

645
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
Ma Hong Jun?

646
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,920
Yeah.

647
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,390
That... Mutant Soul,

648
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,320
the Evil Phoenix?

649
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,200
I want to have a look.

650
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,390
Rong Rong.

651
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,990
I can maintain it.

652
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,040
Can't you feel any pain?

653
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,960
You've already tried so many times.

654
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,600
Do you really think you can control it?

655
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,510
None of your business.

656
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm telling the truth.

657
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,350
Certain things

658
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,350
can't be achieved by just being persistent.

659
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,080
Obviously, his Martial Soul is flawed.

660
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,200
What are you doing?

661
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,560
I know I might not get anything out of this.

662
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,920
But if I don't even try,

663
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,680
there's really no hope at all.

664
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,920
You want to become a Soul Master?

665
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,150
I don't think I can become a Soul Master.

666
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,920
But at least,
I need to control my Martial Soul.

667
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,270
But you're hurt.

668
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm fine.

669
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,630
I can still go on.

670
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,630
We're busy.

671
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,600
Please leave.

672
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,800
Let's continue.

673
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,150
You didn't even eat it.

674
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,870
I'll heat it up for you.

675
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,110
Who made you angry?

676
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,040
Rong Rong.

677
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Why are you angry?

678
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,750
Who is it?

679
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,230
What are you doing?

680
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,840
I...

681
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,350
I'm training my stealth skills.

682
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,110
Did you see everything?

683
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,350
Clearly.

684
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,270
Everything I said

685
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,920
was for Ma Hong Jun's own good.

686
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,720
He wants to control his Martial Soul.

687
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,320
Is that really an easy feat?

688
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,350
Look at how arrogant that Dai Mu Bai was.

689
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,470
He just lost his temper at me

690
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,771
without even understanding my intentions.

691
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,320
He's so annoying!

692
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,560
Do you speak like this at home?

693
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,350
Yes!

694
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,080
Do you have any friends?

695
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,990
What do you mean?

696
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,080
If you speak to everyone

697
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
with such an arrogant tone,

698
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,270
who would accept you?

699
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm not.

700
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,680
This is Shi Lan Ke School.

701
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,800
Not Qibao Amber Clan.

702
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
You're not a princess here.

703
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,390
We're all from the same school.

704
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,390
You should learn

705
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,840
to communicate with others.

706
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,150
Sister Qing.

707
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,320
You said

708
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,150
that you had been
practicing your stealth skills?

709
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
That's why I saw it clearly.

710
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,470
Then were you concerned about Ma Hong Jun,

711
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,470
or, in fact,

712
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,840
you were concerned about Dai Mu Bai?

713
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,870
I have nothing to do with him.

714
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,510
Sister Qing.

715
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,200
Shouldn't you also learn

716
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,470
to communicate with others?

717
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,630
Drink it.

718
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,870
I didn't go berserk.

719
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,320
I controlled it.

720
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,270
I didn't go berserk! I did it!

721
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,510
Not bad.

722
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
He didn't go berserk at all this time.

723
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
As long as I don't fully release

724
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,270
my power, I can control it.

725
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,510
Then it's not full control.

726
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,680
Continue tomorrow.

727
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,150
Hong Jun.

728
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,440
Hasn't Bu Le appeared?

729
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,680
Not yet.

730
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,200
He should have appeared.

731
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,720
Hong Jun already fought so many times.

732
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,990
The Mutant Soul is already very famous.

733
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,920
Perhaps his opponents weren't strong enough?

734
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,350
Ma Hong Jun.

735
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,510
Choose your opponent tomorrow.

736
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,510
Choose who?

737
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,200
Me.

738
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,720
(He's controlling it well.)

739
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,600
Come on!

740
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,720
(His Second Soul Skill is Flame Boost.)

741
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,750
Blue Silver Plant can be used in this way?

742
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,510
Just to avoid the impact.

743
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,600
If it's a direct blow,

744
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,440
it may not be enough.

745
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,710
Hong Jun!

746
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,600
Awesome! Cool!

747
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,120
Dai Mu Bai, I want to challenge you!

748
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,190
Great! Awesome!

749
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,560
Bring that little girl to the tavern.

750
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,230
Little girl?

751
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,430
Not Ma Hong Jun?

752
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,950
He comes here every day.

753
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,430
If that little girl leaves,

754
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,270
she will be gone.

755
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,400
I understand.

756
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,230
Don't worry.

757
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,270
No problem.

758
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,710
Let's say,

759
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,600
after I register,

760
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,430
I'll challenge Brother Dai tomorrow.

761
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,400
Good?

762
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,670
Can't you do the same at school?

763
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,687
It's different.

764
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,910
It feels better

765
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,990
to fight at the Soul Arena.

766
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,230
Then you should

767
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,510
ask Brother Dai first.

768
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,190
He has to accept your challenge first.

769
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,640
Alright.

770
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,160
Little girl, come with us.

771
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,560
Did you get the wrong person?

772
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,120
You can go.
