14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,000
What status?

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
He was born to be the Governor.
It's hereditary.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,630
But it's unfair.

17
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,310
Everyone should gain dominions and power

18
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,630
with one's own strength.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,910
How could someone be born with it?

20
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,230
I don't quite understand either.

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,310
Wu,

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,680
the Soul Master Association's election
will be held this afternoon, right?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,080
I think so.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,760
Stop picking things up. Let's go.

25
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,830
With the sleeve arrow,

26
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,630
I'm invincible!

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,830
Be careful.

28
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,240
What's wrong?

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,190
What took you so long?

30
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,960
What is it?

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,750
The election is over.

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,550
Isn't it supposed
to be held in the afternoon?

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,470
Young Master Xiao

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,880
brought the election forward
to this morning.

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,190
They outnumbered others,

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
and he is now the President
of the Soul Master Association.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the new timetable

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,160
for attached students.

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,270
Look.

40
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,960
He's obviously targeting both of you.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,080
From now on,

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,160
not only do you need
to work in the afternoon,

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
but also in the morning.

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,470
If this continues,

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,830
you will have no time for class.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
You can't attend Soul Power training,

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,960
so you won't have a chance to advance.

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,000
It's fine.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,030
We can sneak in the class.

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,720
No, Brother San.

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,000
Nuoding City and the School
are under the control of the Xiao family.

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,880
You can't fight against them.

53
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,110
How about this?

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,910
Both of you run away.

55
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,440
Why should we run away?

56
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,750
Young Master Xiao is
more terrifying than he looks.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,830
He will do anything.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,270
It sounds like you know him very well.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,670
Look.

60
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,800
Who did this?

61
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,720
My dad works in the mine.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,910
It belongs to the Governor.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
On the day my Martial Soul awakened,

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,670
Young Master Xiao asked his men

65
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,910
to beat me up.

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,880
I got no Soul Skill.

67
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
There was nothing I could do.

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,470
He told me to bear in mind

69
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,630
that even if I become a Soul Master,

70
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,550
I still belong to Nuoding City

71
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,720
and the Xiao family.

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,630
Drink this.

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,390
Your wounds will heal quickly.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,830
It's fine, Brother San.

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,750
The wounds were caused by Martial Soul.

76
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,880
They are harder to heal,

77
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,360
and they can't be treated
by ordinary medications.

78
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,440
Don't worry.

79
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,470
If that jerk beats you again,

80
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,270
come over and tell me.

81
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,160
Sister Wu will protect you.

82
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,080
We can't let the election
slide so easily.

83
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll go to the Soul Master Association now.

84
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,550
Keep an eye on it.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,320
Don't let anyone come in.

86
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,390
(Even the Soul Master
from the City Main Office is here.)

87
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,920
Again.

88
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,270
I'm counting on you.

89
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,880
Who is it?

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,670
Hurry up!

91
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,720
(Adapt to your Martial Soul.)

92
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,950
(You must have faith in it.)

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,550
(Because the heart of faith)

94
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,950
(is indeed your Martial Soul.)

95
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,950
(The heart of faith is the Martial Soul.)

96
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,480
Is it reliable?

97
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,880
Of course.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,230
Officer Ling Feng did it himself.

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
There won't be any problem.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,550
Don't worry.

101
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,670
Young Master.

102
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,230
It's Ghost Wolf.

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,350
It's the most suitable Soul Beast for you.

104
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Officer Ling Feng

105
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
had it under control.

106
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
You only need to kill it.

107
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,320
What is the white circle?

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,640
Too bad, it's just a white Soul Ring.

109
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,880
If this Soul Beast is
more than a hundred years old,

110
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,200
it's easy to kill,

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,670
but hard to capture.

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,720
You're right.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,230
What about Martial Soul Hall?

114
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,350
We'll get an update soon.

115
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Tang San is just a bumpkin.

116
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
There's no way that he is connected

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,070
to Martial Soul Hall.

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,640
Make things clear before you carry on.

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,760
You did it.

121
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,950
Young Master, you did it.

122
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,440
Finally, I'm a real Soul Master.

123
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
Tang San,

124
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,510
I'm going to teach you a lesson soon.

125
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,400
What colour was it?

126
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,400
White.

127
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,590
A white Soul Ring?
It's less than a hundred years old.

128
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
If what you said is true,

129
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,910
as Xiao Chen Yu hates you so much,

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,470
he hasn't done anything to you

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,790
because you were recommended
by Martial Soul Hall.

132
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,880
That's why he is being cautious.

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,110
I have nothing to do with
Martial Soul Hall.

134
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
He will find this out soon.

135
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,790
What are you going to do then?

136
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,080
What was he doing?

137
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,400
Obtaining a Soul Ring

138
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,440
marks the beginning
of the practice of a Soul Master.

139
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,000
Why did he have to kill it in person?

140
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,400
The Soul Master

141
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
must kill a Soul Beast
with his final hit

142
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,590
to absorb its Soul Ring.

143
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,880
I guess his father's men

144
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,790
captured it for him.

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,640
Actually, what he wants is Wu alone.

146
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
You should stay away from it

147
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
and don't get involved.

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,150
Thanks for telling me these things.

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,320
There's one last option for you.

150
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,400
I can help you to get a Soul Ring

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
and become a real Soul Master.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,030
Wait for me here tonight.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,910
Why are you helping me?

154
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
It's a deal,

155
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,440
so you'll have to help me too.

156
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,350
What can I do for you?

157
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,030
You'll know that later.

158
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,000
If you really want to protect that girl,

159
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,790
remember,

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,280
tonight will be your only chance.

161
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,790
The School is just an illusion.

162
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,200
The life of a Soul Master

163
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,550
is full of blood and danger,

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,710
along with endless exciting things

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
to be discovered by you.

166
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,710
Are you ready to welcome

167
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,880
this whole new world with me?

168
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
Why are you helping me?

169
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
A Soul Master shouldn't get used to slaughters.

170
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,590
The strong must protect the weak.

171
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,000
Your philosophy differs from the others.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
To be honest, it's quite silly.

173
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,110
I know.

174
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,110
But that's what I believe.

175
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,960
They say I'm silly too.

176
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,110
Well, I guess fools should work together.

177
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,910
Come with me.

178
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,520
Let's look for

179
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
your Soul Ring together.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Look, it's not bad.

181
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,200
Boss, look at this.

182
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
This is nice.

183
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,670
Ten silver soul coins.

184
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,350
Ten silver soul coins.

185
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,080
Right.

186
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,760
The craftsmanship is bad.

187
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,150
Master, what are we waiting for?

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,350
Wait for them to close.

189
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,400
Why?

190
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,640
In order to help you obtain your Soul Ring,

191
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,000
we need to capture a Soul Beast.

192
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
To look for a wild Soul Beast
near Nuoding City,

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,440
we can only go
to the Soul Hunting Forest.

194
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,030
What does it have to do with the shop?

195
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,590
The Soul Hunting Forest

196
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,110
is guarded by Law Enforcement Corps
of Martial Soul Hall.

197
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,670
We can't enter
without a clearance warrant.

198
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Martial Soul Hall dominates the forest.

199
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,400
The forests where most Soul Beasts live

200
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,520
are guarded by Martial Soul Hall.

201
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,230
There are many Grand Soul Land Masters
in Martial Soul Hall.

202
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,030
They are powerful,

203
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,910
especially the current chief of
Martial Soul Hall.

204
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,520
She is known as the greatest Soul Master.

205
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,470
What is the chief's name?

206
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,670
Her name is

207
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,400
Bi Bi...

208
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,110
Anyway, everyone calls her chief.

209
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,320
They won't call her by her name.

210
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,910
We need to get the clearance warrant

211
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,760
in order to enter the Soul Hunting Forest.

212
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,470
So, Martial Soul Hall owns this shop?

213
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,280
No.

214
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,960
But we can get
the clearance warrant here.

215
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,320
Why do we have to wait
for the shop to close?

216
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,640
The warrants here are ill-gotten,

217
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,150
so they can't sell it openly.

218
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,710
It's almost time.

219
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,880
Master,

220
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,960
is the warrant expensive?

221
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
I know you're poor.

222
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,910
I'll pay you back.

223
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm working in an ironsmith shop.

224
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,110
I can earn seven to eight
silver soul coins per month.

225
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,960
It's too late.

226
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,030
Thank you in advance.

227
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,080
I'll pay you back
when I've saved enough money.

228
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,150
There's no need to thank me.

229
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,590
I don't have money either.

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,910
How are we supposed to buy it then?

231
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,200
You haven't seen
my Martial Soul, have you?

232
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,760
No.

233
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,440
This is my Martial Soul,

234
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,880
Luo San Pao.

235
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,400
Well...

236
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,670
Is this a Tool Soul or a Beast Soul?

237
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Neither.

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,440
It is a Mutant Soul.

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
I can't believe
that it has mutated into a pig.

240
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,080
It's a dog.

241
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,110
It can run outside your body.

242
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,110
Isn't your Tool Soul, Blue Silver Plant,

243
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,960
staying outside your body as well?

244
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,790
So there are three types of Martial Soul,

245
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,960
Tool Soul, Beast Soul,

246
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,350
and Mutant Soul.

247
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
The formation can be divided
into two types,

248
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,110
within the body

249
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,280
and outside the body.

250
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,550
You're good at summarizing

251
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,840
and you're studious.

252
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,030
Practice makes perfect.

253
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,080
I have so much to learn.

254
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,910
We're closed.

255
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,200
A deal for the Soul Hunting Forest.

256
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,670
We want to get in there.

257
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
One hundred gold soul coins.

258
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,840
One hundred gold soul coins?

259
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,910
Are you robbing us?

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,590
A clearance warrant
from Martial Soul Hall is hard to get.

261
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,960
Take it or leave it.

262
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,110
We don't have money.

263
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,150
Get lost.

264
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,880
But I have a living Soul Beast.

265
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,320
One gold soul coin is worth
ten silver soul coins,

266
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,030
which are worth
a hundred copper soul coins.

267
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,400
It's enough for
my dad and me to use

268
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,790
for several months in the Saint of Soul Village.

269
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
A Soul Beast is worth
a hundred gold soul coins.

270
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,400
Soul Beasts are extremely proud.

271
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,230
They would blow themselves up
if they lose in a battle,

272
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,150
so a living Soul Beast is priceless.

273
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,590
Didn't they capture a living Soul Beast

274
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,960
for Xiao Chen Yu to get his Soul Ring?

275
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,910
It was stunned by some special means.

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,840
He's the son of the Governor.

277
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,710
They have resources and men,

278
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,520
yet they could only capture

279
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,910
a Ghost Wolf
that's less than a hundred years old.

280
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,230
It's very difficult to capture
a living Soul Beast.

281
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
But the one you used to trade
for this warrant,

282
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,520
it's not a Soul Beast.

283
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,470
It's your Martial Soul.

284
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,760
He can't tell.

285
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,000
Mutant Souls are rare.

286
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,400
Can you get your dog back?

287
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,350
I can take it back anytime.

288
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,710
We were lying to him.

289
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,910
Why do you think
I asked you to walk faster?

290
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
That's not good.

291
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
Hurry up.

292
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,110
This is the Soul Hunting Forest.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,710
Look.

294
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,000
Law Enforcement Corps from Martial Soul Hall.

295
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,640
That's a Soul Honour

296
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,280
who has got his third Soul Ring.

297
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,080
He's strong.

298
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,790
If anyone tries to break into

299
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,000
or sneak into the forest,

300
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,400
it's almost impossible to succeed.

301
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,440
I understand it.

302
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,350
All I want to know is,

303
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,000
why did you tell me
to carry so many radishes?

304
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,880
That's for Luo San Pao.

305
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,280
Luo San Pao?

306
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,350
Isn't Luo San Pao a dog?

307
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,400
It eats radishes as well?

308
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,880
It's related to its means of attack.

309
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,000
Come, let's go.

310
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,830
Wait.

311
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,400
What are these for?

312
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,070
Dog food.

313
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,470
Fine, fine, enter.

314
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,560
There's no time limit.
Life and death are your own business.

315
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,680
I guess he ran away.

316
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,000
It's not a bad thing.

317
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,950
Staying here would do him no good.

318
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,350
Make way.

319
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,760
I don't think he ran away.

320
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,640
Whose baggage is this?

321
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,190
Brother San's.

322
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank you.

323
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,520
Your father is doing fine lately.

324
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,000
The guards are
staying with him every day.

325
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
They're monitoring his every move.

326
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,560
If anything happens,

327
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,640
we'll inform you immediately.

328
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,110
Wang Sheng,

329
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,710
study hard.

330
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,560
So when you return to your family,

331
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,110
all of you can come together again.

332
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,000
Right?

333
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,880
Boo!

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,800
Anyway,

335
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,040
thank you

336
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,830
for helping me to take the first step.

337
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,470
Don't mention it. It's just a deal.

338
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,830
Absorbing the Soul Ring from the Soul Beast

339
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,560
is a transformation of energy.

340
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,040
There's a limit to the Soul Master's capacity

341
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
to withstand the Soul Ring.

342
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,710
I think I've heard of this.

343
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,230
I read it in a book at school.

344
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
There's a precise number for the limit.

345
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,470
For example,

346
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,160
if a person wants to get
his first Soul Ring like you,

347
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,520
the age limit of the Soul Beast

348
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,230
to be hunted is 423 years old.

349
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,400
The closer it is to that limit,

350
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,830
the more obvious
your improvement would be.

351
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,000
But if it exceeds the age limit,

352
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,590
your body won't be able to contain it,

353
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,070
and then you will fail to advance.

354
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,950
Four hundred and twenty-three years old.

355
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,680
It's not mentioned in the book.

356
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,350
It's calculated theoretically.

357
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,520
Amazing.

358
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,680
But how do we know

359
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
how old the Soul Beast is?

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
Luo San Pao's sense of smell
is extraordinary.

361
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,640
It can tell its opponent's
strengths and weaknesses.

362
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
With its guidance,

363
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,710
we can find you
the most suitable Soul Beast.

364
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,000
Young Master.

365
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,760
The Governor mentioned
that the Soul Hunting Forest is dangerous.

366
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,680
You can't go there in person.

367
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,640
Do you know the reason

368
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,430
why a family would decline?

369
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,710
They take away the rights
of their descendants

370
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,430
to move forward
in the name of protection.

371
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,640
If they always protect their descendants,

372
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
it will only make them weak.

373
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Well, what if Tang San and the others

374
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,590
have really run away?

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,680
Liu Long.

376
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,230
Didn't you notice his eyes?

377
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,040
What is it?

378
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,160
People like him

379
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,110
will never run away

380
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,280
before being crushed completely.

381
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,710
Why don't we check again?

382
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,590
There are people who saw him leave the city,

383
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,760
but we can't confirm

384
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,470
that he went to the Soul Hunting Forest.

385
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,070
I've cut off

386
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,920
all the assistance
from the school to him.

387
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,680
Under the circumstances,

388
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,070
if it were me,

389
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,560
I would be left with only one choice,

390
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,190
which is to kill a Soul Beast
and obtain a Soul Ring.

391
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,070
He's no match for you.

392
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,590
I never belittle my opponent.

393
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,110
Back at the school,

394
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,560
everyone was watching.

395
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,280
I would look bad if I hurt him.

396
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,520
But now it's different.

397
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,830
I will track him down

398
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,280
and destroy his pride and hope

399
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,190
with my own hands.

400
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,710
I will snatch his girl away

401
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,350
and crush him.

402
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,430
That's more interesting.

403
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,350
But we haven't
confirmed his relationship

404
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,280
with Martial Soul Hall.

405
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm not going to kill him.

406
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,760
I only want to make him give in.

407
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,070
Here you go.

408
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,590
Thank you, Master.

409
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Get some rest.

410
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,520
We'll depart after Luo San Pao

411
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,640
has enough rest.

412
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,640
Master, we didn't get very far.

413
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,760
It gets tired easily.

414
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,280
It's not moving at all.

415
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,280
Did it pass out?

416
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,680
It is actually awake.

417
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,110
This...

418
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,350
Luo San Pao is a Martial Soul.

419
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,430
Yet it can eat too?

420
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,230
This is indeed a way to get energy.

421
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,800
So, maintaining it

422
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,590
consumes little of my Soul Power.

423
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,800
Here, San Pao.

424
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,430
Have a radish.

425
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,520
San Pao.

426
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,040
Why isn't it eating?

427
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,070
Have you ever seen
a dog that likes eating radishes?

428
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,560
Then why did you

429
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
make me bring so many radishes?

430
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,710
Be careful!

431
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,160
Luo San Pao!

432
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,350
Break wind like striking thunder,
rumble the heavens and split the earth!

433
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,470
Ghost Wolf.

434
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,040
White Soul Ring.
It's less than a hundred years old.

435
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,230
The same Soul Ring appeared

436
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
after Xiao Chen Yu
killed the Ghost Wolf.

437
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,680
What is this ring exactly?

438
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,800
It is just a kind of energy.

439
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,640
Soul Ring of a Decade Soul Beast
is white in colour.

440
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,830
Soul Ring of a Century Soul Beast
is yellow in colour.

441
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,470
That of a Millennium Soul Beast
is purple in colour.

442
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,590
Soul Ring of a Decade Millennium Soul Beast
is black in colour.

443
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,800
Soul Ring of a Century Millennium Soul Beast
is red in colour.

444
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,110
A hundred thousand years.

445
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,880
Is it possible
for a Soul Beast to live that long?

446
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,560
If you have the chance
to go to the Star Forest,

447
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,350
you might see one

448
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,800
if you're lucky.

449
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,640
I killed it.

450
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Others can never absorb it.

451
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,070
Aren't you going to absorb it?

452
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,070
What a waste.

453
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,880
My Martial Soul is ruined.

454
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,470
It's meaningless for me.

455
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,800
Why did the corpse
and Soul Ring disappear?

456
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,310
Generally, if the Soul Master
doesn't absorb it,

457
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,190
the Soul Ring and the corpse

458
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,950
will disappear within two hours.

459
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,920
This Ghost Wolf
was less than a hundred years old.

460
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,880
That's why it disappeared soon.

461
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
Do you absorb the Soul Ring

462
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,880
by touching it with your hands?

463
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,400
You'd better start your Martial Soul first.

464
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,280
You'll need it when you absorb the Soul Ring.

465
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,880
San Pao did a great job.

466
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,560
Why did you say it was ruined?

467
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,760
We're merely making a deal.

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
I don't have to explain it to you.

469
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,000
It was San Pao's Soul Skill, right?

470
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,680
It was amazing.

471
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,310
It...

472
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,830
It just looked a bit...

473
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,400
Right.

474
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,800
Its means of attack

475
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,110
is quite special.

476
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,640
Indeed.

477
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,040
Didn't you say it didn't eat radishes?

478
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,430
Luo San Pao can only launch three attacks.

479
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
After that,

480
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,470
it needs to rely on radishes
to replenish its energy.

481
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,470
Only the radish?

482
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,160
It's the most effective one.

483
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,230
Tang San.

484
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,680
Wu?

485
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
You're from the City Main Office.

486
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,070
Please go in.

487
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Excuse me.

488
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,470
Has anyone else gone inside today?

489
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,560
Yes.

490
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,190
Was he about my age?

491
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,000
More or less.

492
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,230
Were they a man and a woman?

493
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,110
Are you done?
Do you want to enter or not?

494
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
Be care of your attitude!

495
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,560
Last question.

496
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,920
They're still inside, right?

497
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,560
Yes.

498
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,590
Thank you.

499
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,430
Come out first.

500
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,400
So this is San Pao?

501
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,070
It's chubby and adorable.

502
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,070
Is it because it can only

503
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,280
launch three attacks

504
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,230
that it's called San Pao?

505
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
But it's weird.

506
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,560
Why is it a pig?

507
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,640
It is a dog.

508
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,000
Wu.

509
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,640
Why did you follow us here?

510
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,590
Well, that's because you didn't ask me
to come along.

511
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,230
But why were you in the basket?

512
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,920
When you bought the radishes,

513
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,190
the boss was moving
the baskets at the back,

514
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,640
so I sneaked in.

515
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,190
I'm smart, right?

516
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,310
That's not the point now.

517
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,760
We're in the Soul Hunting Forest.

518
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,040
There are Soul Beasts everywhere.

519
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Do you know how dangerous it is?

520
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,470
Well, I'm already here.

521
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,920
You can't tell me
to go home alone, can you?

522
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,470
Can we send her
out of this place first?

523
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,590
It's easy to go out.

524
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,430
But how do we get
another warrant to come here again?

525
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,800
I'll follow you,

526
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,280
and I'll run if I'm in danger.

527
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,350
The most powerful part
of a rabbit is its legs.

528
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,040
I can run really fast.

529
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,190
I have the sleeve arrow as well.

530
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,710
I promise I won't cause you trouble.

531
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,190
Young Master.

532
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,710
Look at his attitude.

533
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,920
If you hadn't stopped me,

534
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,710
I would have used Black Tiger Heart Digging

535
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,710
on him.

536
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,000
They are Law Enforcement Corps
from Martial Soul Hall.

537
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,070
Do you dare to attack them?

538
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,950
Martial Soul Hall is too much.

539
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,760
It's like

540
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,800
they own the Soul Hunting Forest!

541
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,590
Besides, they're just a Sect.

542
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,880
How dare they treat you

543
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,760
so disrespectfully?

544
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,830
Liu Long.

545
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,430
Remember.

546
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,800
You can only be domineering
if you're strong.

547
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,710
Yes, yes.

548
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,560
Young Master.

549
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,430
Young Master,
there's a wheel track here.

550
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,830
It goes that way.

551
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,830
Entering the forest with a trolley.

552
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,280
I wonder who gave them the warrant.

553
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,950
There's no hurry.

554
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,190
We have time to question them
when we catch them.

555
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,310
Follow it.

556
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,310
Sure.

557
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,040
Are you hungry?

558
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,830
We only have radishes here.

559
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,950
We don't have time.

560
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,590
Why?

561
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,590
We need to run.

562
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,590
Run?

563
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,350
What do you want to do?

564
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
I heard

565
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,830
you killed a Ghost Wolf.

566
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:36,920
Right.

567
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,040
Ghost Wolfs live in packs

568
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,950
in the forest!

569
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,950
A pack of Ghost Wolfs.

570
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,920
It'll be tough.

571
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,760
Run!

572
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,950
It's impossible to escape.

573
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,400
Let's fight them.

574
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,160
We have to distract them.

575
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,560
Who will do it?

576
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,280
Luo San Pao.

577
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,350
Okay.

578
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,160
Let's change...

579
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,880
Tang San.

580
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,710
Tang San.

581
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,950
Tang San.

582
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350
What are you doing?

583
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,310
I overheard your conversation.

584
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,470
He was lying to you.

585
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
He lied? What did he lie about?

586
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,520
He said 423 years

587
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,830
was the age limit
for the first Soul Ring.

588
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
There's no such theory.

589
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
How do you know?

590
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,830
I've read all the theoretical books

591
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,560
in the school library.

592
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,400
Do you know?

593
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
An advanced Soul Master once said

594
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
that if your first Soul Ring

595
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,640
came from a Soul Beast
that's more than 300 years old,

596
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,430
you would fail to advance for sure.

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,280
Maybe he wanted me

598
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,160
to challenge the limit.

599
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,680
If you fail to advance,

600
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,560
it would cause severe injury or death.

601
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,520
Master was obviously trying to harm you.

602
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,640
If that's the case,

603
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,760
he could just hand me

604
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,560
to Xiao Chen Yu.

605
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,310
All he wants to do
is to validate his theory.

606
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,230
He doesn't care

607
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,350
if this method

608
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,070
would cause you harm or not.

609
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,000
No.

610
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,430
I've thought about it.

611
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,830
His plan for my Blue Silver Plant

612
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,520
is right

613
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,400
and reasonable.

614
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,160
Do you really want to get a Soul Ring?

615
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,640
Xiao Chen Yu has advanced.

616
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,920
I'm running out of time.

617
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,640
Are you going to kill a Soul Beast

618
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,920
even if it doesn't harm you?

619
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,430
I don't want to.

620
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,950
But for all these years,

621
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,400
this is what the Soul Masters
have been doing.

622
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay.

623
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,230
Let's find a fierce, evil Soul Beast.

624
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,110
Then it will be alright.

625
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,470
A fierce, evil one?

626
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,160
I think it's Earth Rat. It's adorable.

627
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,830
Let's get another one.

628
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,310
I've always wanted to ask you.

629
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,310
Why are you

630
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,800
so fond of reading theoretical books?

631
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,190
I came to the school to figure out

632
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,400
the essence of Martial Soul.

633
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,430
Have you figured it out?

634
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,520
Not yet, it's complicated.

635
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,280
It takes time.

636
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,000
What is it again?

637
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,070
The territory of Ghost Wolfs.

638
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
The interesting thing is,

639
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,350
almost all Soul Beasts

640
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,710
have avoided that place.

641
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,920
How do you know?

642
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,400
We didn't see any Soul Beasts along the way.

643
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,280
I saw their tracks.

644
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,070
And there's the odor.

645
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,950
It's obvious.

646
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,430
How can you tell all these?

647
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,710
I grew up in a forest.

648
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,680
Let's go.

649
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,110
I'm sure there's something huge.

650
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,110
Here.

651
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,400
What is it?

652
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,640
The tracks of Soul Beasts.

653
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,640
You can even notice them.

654
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,160
It's ahead of us.

655
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,430
It seems like

656
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,190
it was torn by something.

657
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,280
Two Soul Beasts fought each other.

658
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,350
It was an intense fight.

659
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,040
Both of them might be injured.

660
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,000
It's Spotted Cat.

661
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,310
Its claw attack is very strong.

662
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,110
It seems to be injured.

663
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,110
Can I use it

664
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,310
as my first Soul Ring?

665
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,400
Although it's injured,
it's still very strong.

666
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Not to mention that you have no Soul Skill.

667
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,040
Let's give it a try.

668
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,560
(Purple Demon Eye.)

669
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,430
That's so pitiable.

670
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,830
Aren't you going to kill it?

671
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,920
Forget it.

672
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
The forest is large.

673
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,950
We'll find another one.

674
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,430
Great.

675
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,710
You don't want me to kill it?

676
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,560
Why didn't you stop me?

677
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,680
If I stop you

678
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,000
just because I like cats,

679
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,640
it'll be unfair to you.

680
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,590
I can't

681
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,430
just ask for anything I want.

682
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,080
Next time, you can tell me

683
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,390
whatever you want.

684
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,150
I saw that your eyes were
glowing purple just now.

685
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,670
Was that the power of your Martial Soul?

686
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,230
Sort of.

687
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
That was pretty.

688
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,760
But,

689
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,230
isn't Blue Silver Plant blue in colour?

690
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,710
Why was there purple light?

691
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,080
The cat must have passed out

692
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,360
because of excessive blood loss.

693
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,000
Its wound is still bleeding.

694
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,800
The injury must be severe.

695
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,800
Tang San, are you in a hurry
to look for a Soul Beast?

696
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,360
Do you want to save it?

697
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,190
If we don't save the mother,

698
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,800
the kitten is going to die too.

699
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
But how do we save them?

700
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,710
I'll look around.

701
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
I guess there are herbs
that can stop the bleeding.

702
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,280
I'll be back soon.

703
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,870
I'll go with you.

704
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,280
You don't know what it looks like.

705
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,670
Stay here and keep an eye on them.

706
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll be back soon.

707
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,360
You even know what kind of herb

708
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,040
can stop the bleeding?

709
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,280
It's because I grew up in the wild.

710
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,870
I'll get you some fruit on my way back.

711
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,080
Okay, hurry back.

712
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,190
I'll wait for you here.

713
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay.

714
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,470
Wu!

715
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,560
Are you okay?

716
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,870
It hurts.

717
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
What happened?

718
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,670
Brother Tang.

719
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,000
