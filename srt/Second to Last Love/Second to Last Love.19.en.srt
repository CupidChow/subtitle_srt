1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,039
- Fire!
- Fire!

2
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:10,654
Min Ju!

3
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:12,494
Min Ju!

4
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,187
Min Ju!

5
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:32,100
Min Ju. Gang Min Ju, wake up.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,295
No, we have to go.

7
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:09,588
- Gi Cheol, are you okay?
- Yes.

8
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:11,101
Would Boss be okay?

9
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:15,584
- Watch the head.
- Careful.

10
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,859
We have a critical patient.

11
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,474
This patient is critical. Move aside.

12
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,146
Please get out of the way.

13
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:23,548
One, two, three.

14
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,435
- Get out of the way.
- Is that Boss?

15
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:39,618
I believed loneliness would
remain in adulthood.

16
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,518
But at this very moment,

17
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:45,720
I don't feel alone on the verge of death.

18
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,826
I believed loneliness would be
a natural thing in adulthood.

19
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,823
But at this very moment,

20
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,630
now at death's door,

21
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,099
I've realized that I'm not alone.

22
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,409
Mi Rye!

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,519
Mi Rye!

24
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,554
Jun Woo!

25
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,228
- Sang Sik.
- Producer Nam.

26
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,408
What happened?

27
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,081
The hotel we lodged at caught on fire.

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:32,233
They stayed back to evacuate everyone,

29
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,533
but couldn't make it out.

30
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,792
Excuse me, what's their condition?

31
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,969
Both patients inhaled a significant
amount of toxic fumes.

32
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,505
They have been treated,
but are unconscious,

33
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:46,292
so we'll keep a close eye on them.

34
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:50,313
- Goodness no.
- Sang Hee.

35
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:51,314
Sang Hee.

36
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,362
My goodness, Mi Rye.

37
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:03,872
(Second to Last Love)

38
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,200
Last night at 10 p.m.,
Cheongsong House in Woori City...

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,751
was engulfed in flames.

40
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:12,473
Including the SBC's drama team
staying at the hotel,

41
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:14,527
there were roughly a hundred occupants,

42
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,608
a number which could have led
to great casualties.

43
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,509
Witnesses stated shortly after the fire,

44
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,325
that Woori City's Ko Sang Sik
and SBC's Gang Min Ju...

45
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:23,917
What's going on here?

46
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,399
had promptly evacuated
the other occupants.

47
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,551
When are they going to wake up?

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,977
They'll soon regain consciousness.

49
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,431
I hope they wake up as if
nothing happened.

50
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,864
Why does misfortune always find him?

51
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:56,944
He was finally letting her in.

52
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:01,248
It's not fair that this happened to him.

53
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,317
Luckily, nobody died.

54
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,711
But where does this leave me?

55
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,117
If the police investigate the fire...

56
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,799
and discover how the hotel
wasn't inspected,

57
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,687
even you won't be able to fix this.

58
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:25,173
The hotel was damaged in the fire,

59
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,326
so it's hard for them to check.

60
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:31,421
Your hotel's licensing issue
won't ever surface.

61
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,502
Why now with the drama crew?

62
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,366
This only draws the media.

63
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:40,955
If this escalates into the ferry issue,

64
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,652
you'll have to take the fall.

65
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,747
It won't come to that.

66
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,438
Don't worry, Chairman Gong.

67
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,503
I can't bear to see them this way.

68
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,829
They should have gotten out.

69
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,931
Why were they trying to be heroes?

70
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,115
If they save everyone but themselves,

71
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,790
what good would that do?

72
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:32,955
After all the hardships he faced,

73
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:36,589
he only started to be happy with her.

74
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:39,766
But what's all this now?

75
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,222
Honey.

76
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,141
Let go.

77
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,872
You live your life.

78
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,662
I'll live mine.

79
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,031
Sang Hee.

80
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:06,044
Aunt Sang Hee.

81
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,634
Dad.

82
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,830
Min Ju.

83
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,646
This is my fault.

84
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,853
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,393
I blamed them.

86
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:42,348
I confronted their relationship...

87
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,295
and how they didn't tell me about it.

88
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:50,253
I should have used kinder words.

89
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:54,103
By the looks of it,
I ended up hurting them instead.

90
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,262
What about me?

91
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:04,597
Feeling guilt for what I did,

92
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,312
I'm struggling with words.

93
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,719
Where does that leave me?

94
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,311
I share the blame.

95
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:53,872
Sang Sik.

96
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,339
He just moved.

97
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,503
I'll get the doctor.

98
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:00,503
Okay.

99
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,201
Really?

100
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,779
Yes, all right.

101
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,889
Chief Ko has regained consciousness,

102
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,777
but Producer Gang hasn't yet.

103
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,117
What? Seriously.

104
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,165
I know life and death come first,

105
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,749
but there is also work to do.

106
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,484
This is frustrating.

107
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:21,644
If it weren't for those two,
we might not be here.

108
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:24,847
The actors are shaken since
they barely escaped.

109
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,279
The same with the staff.

110
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,184
Then what should we do?

111
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:32,823
I'll meet with everyone to see
how they are doing...

112
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:34,224
and proceed with the shoots.

113
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:37,496
Okay, you handle that.

114
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:39,426
I'll do what I can.

115
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:44,171
Dad.

116
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,715
Do you see me?

117
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:48,839
Can you see me now?

118
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:49,964
Sang Sik.

119
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,468
Sang Sik.

120
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,596
Are you with us?

121
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,502
Yes.

122
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,982
You have to stay still.

123
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,888
Yes, Sang Sik.

124
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,504
How is she doing?

125
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,945
Still out.

126
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:22,776
She will wake up soon.

127
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,150
Yes, she will.

128
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,904
She's going to come too.

129
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,473
Will she be okay?

130
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,320
When will she wake up?

131
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:40,408
It's fortunate neither of you
suffered any burns.

132
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,894
We've raised her oxygen level
and given her medication,

133
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,377
so let's wait and see.

134
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,749
Ko Sang Sik has come around,
but not Gang Min Ju.

135
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,701
Seriously?

136
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,424
Why him, of all people?

137
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,239
That's what I'm saying.

138
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,378
Gang Min Ju should come around, too.

139
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,970
Then I should get it in order
before he gets back.

140
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,500
That would work. Move fast.

141
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:23,156
Hello, bring me the files
on Chief Ko's sister.

142
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,181
Ko Sang Sik, you're dead now.

143
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:04,916
Min Ju, we have to go!

144
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,315
I can't move. What now?

145
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:08,671
We have to get out.

146
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:35,687
Please wake up.

147
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,365
I won't run away this time.

148
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,351
I'll get to the bottom of the fire,

149
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,766
so hang in there.

150
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:05,039
You need rest right now.

151
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,632
Where are you going in that state?

152
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,887
I'm okay, so you look after Min Ju.

153
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:10,665
- I'm counting on you.
- Sang Sik.

154
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:12,924
- Sang Sik.
- Goodness.

155
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,732
Chief Ko.

156
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,585
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

157
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,386
Why are you back already?
You need to rest.

158
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:21,977
There is no time for that.

159
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,177
Chief Ko, here.

160
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,810
What caused the fire is unknown,

161
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,373
but their fire lane was used
as a parking space.

162
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,893
(Operating Facilities: 46 rooms)

163
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,539
What are you looking up?

164
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,684
What industry did the ferry
contractor switch to?

165
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:36,979
Hotel business.

166
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,156
Yes, and what was his name?

167
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,925
Gong Koo Sik?

168
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,513
That's what the losing bidder told us.

169
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,525
That's right.

170
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,434
Gong Koo Sik.

171
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,559
(Gong Koo Sik,
201-2 Cheongsong Village 4, Woori City)

172
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,314
- Then...
- What they said was right.

173
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:56,995
The head of the ferry contractor...

174
00:12:56,995 --> 00:13:00,490
declared bankruptcy and switched
to the hotel business.

175
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,748
And it was this person.

176
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,921
Cheongsong House which caught on fire...

177
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,538
used to be the Blue Light Hotel.

178
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:09,794
There are records of fire safety issues...

179
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:12,585
and the hosting of illegal gambling,
which led to its closure.

180
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:15,618
This suggests that the same owner
renovated it last year,

181
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,602
then reopened it under a new name.

182
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:18,602
Exactly.

183
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,474
It was expanded for more rooms.

184
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:24,194
The hotel should have 46 rooms
and fire lanes in place.

185
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:27,129
But the cause of the fire is unclear,
and there might be more.

186
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:29,451
All of this suggests the likelihood...

187
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,370
of the hotel operating
with an unlawful license.

188
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,156
That's right.

189
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:36,807
Then let's report this to the police
and get him arrested.

190
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:39,101
But who could have let this happen?

191
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:45,926
(Shin Seok Gi)

192
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,890
What are you saying?

193
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,770
As you can see from the documents,

194
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,658
it was Chief Ko's sister...

195
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:56,138
who took a public loan using his name.

196
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,987
It wasn't his immediate family,

197
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,695
but his sister who got it secretly.

198
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:05,372
So, you reported this to the Audit Team?

199
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,013
Yes.

200
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,188
That's not the end of it.

201
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,292
The man has long committed
serious ethical issues.

202
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,212
Even with the Cheongsong House fire,

203
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:16,836
he managed to prevent serious casualties.

204
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:19,092
Not to mention the ferry press event.

205
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,244
After everything he's done,

206
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:24,876
this is his way of covering it up.

207
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,644
He's good at manipulating the media.

208
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:30,224
Don't let him deceive you.

209
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,613
- Sang Sik.
- How is she doing?

210
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,494
It's the same.

211
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,145
The test results are expected tomorrow,

212
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:44,611
so you can head back and rest.
I'll take over here.

213
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,793
No, it's okay. You should rest.

214
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:48,641
Her friends will be here soon, so go.

215
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,785
Don't push yourself too hard.

216
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,964
She'll wake up before you know it.

217
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,018
Yes, all right.

218
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:58,034
You should check in on Hun
and your husband.

219
00:14:58,034 --> 00:14:59,098
Okay.

220
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,635
Let's go.

221
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,075
We'll be back.

222
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:14,694
Please open your eyes.

223
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,049
If you wake up,

224
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,822
I'll do anything for you.

225
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,844
(Ms. Kim)

226
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,377
Min Ju, are you conscious now?

227
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,945
I'm at Incheon Airport with your dad.

228
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,537
- Hello?
- Hello?

229
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,457
Isn't this Min Ju's number?

230
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:45,857
Right, yes.

231
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,476
I'm her mother. Who are you?

232
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,178
Are you looking for me?

233
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,797
I'm Min Ju's mother.

234
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,433
Hello, I'm Ko Sang Sik.

235
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,809
Is he the guy marrying Min Ju?

236
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,928
No, I don't know.

237
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:06,491
Let me take that.

238
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:09,467
What's going on with my daughter?

239
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:12,013
We hurried over after her friends called.

240
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,020
Min Ju, what's happened to you?

241
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,039
- Hello.
- Here you are.

242
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,436
- Tae Yeon and Ae Gyeong, hello.
- Ms. Kim.

243
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,588
What's happened to Min Ju?

244
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,475
Why is she lying here like this?

245
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,956
Sweetie, come look at Min Ju.

246
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:30,969
Min Ju.

247
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,911
I've heard about the hotel fire,

248
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:37,639
but why is she lying here alone
when others were safe?

249
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,031
Ms. Kim, you see...

250
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,567
She was rescued late after
trying to save the others.

251
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,112
Why did she face all that danger?

252
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,687
It's hard enough on her own.

253
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,432
Please calm down.

254
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,703
We have to wait until she wakes up.

255
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,976
How painful it must have been.

256
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:56,087
She must have struggled to breathe.

257
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,038
Our daughter will wake up.

258
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:00,935
You know how she pulls through.

259
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:06,334
She's worked so hard without
anyone being there for her.

260
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,517
I never heard her complain,

261
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:12,127
but how tough and lonely
it must have been.

262
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:15,073
But she kept it all to herself.

263
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:30,054
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:32,567
I should have gotten her out quickly.

265
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,517
Why are you saying that?

266
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,579
Trying to save Min Ju,

267
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,284
you were also carried out unconscious.

268
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,258
Are you hurt anywhere?

269
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,960
No, I'm all right.

270
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:49,879
A few days ago, Min Ju called me.

271
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:54,541
She said she's met a nice guy...

272
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,897
and wanted to introduce him to us.

273
00:17:57,526 --> 00:18:02,348
After everything she's been through,

274
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,923
I thought it would all be good now.

275
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,658
Make her happy when she wakes up.

276
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:16,909
There is finally someone for her,

277
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,175
so I wish that for her.

278
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,146
Of course.

279
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,571
I'll make that happen.

280
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:34,086
After getting older like this,

281
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:37,848
I'm starting to get forgetful,
and memories fade.

282
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,769
Do you know what
the most regrettable thing is?

283
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:47,102
Losing memories of all the love.

284
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,790
Even if I forget everything else,

285
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,893
I'll remember that you care for
and cherish my daughter.

286
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:01,792
I won't forget that, even in death.

287
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,066
Thank you.

288
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,031
I'm grateful.

289
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,820
Is this where Min Ju moved to?

290
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,476
It looks like it.

291
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:24,372
Do you live next door to her?

292
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,960
Yes. And if you need anything,

293
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,487
you can ask my sister next door.

294
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,504
I'll be at the hospital, so don't worry.

295
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:38,655
Don't concern yourself about us,
but you should rest.

296
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,808
I'm all right.

297
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:43,914
I'll bring her home from the hospital.

298
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:47,159
With her lying unconscious,

299
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,569
I don't know how we could sleep well.

300
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,151
You should look after your health.

301
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,056
What if you collapse?

302
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,935
Yes, I'll keep your daughter safe.

303
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,662
So please take care of yourself.

304
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,032
Yes, you go on now.

305
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:05,915
Min Ju would recover faster
with you there.

306
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,087
Thank you.

307
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,895
It's reassuring that you'll be with her.

308
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,489
I appreciate that.

309
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,735
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,983
But are you okay?

311
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,830
I'm fine.

312
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,997
Min Ju's parents are saying next door,

313
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,152
so make sure to look in on them.

314
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,609
Of course.

315
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,618
I'll make sure to do that.

316
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,656
Sang Hee.

317
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:44,368
I hope she wakes up soon.

318
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,028
There is so much I need to say.

319
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:50,510
What is it? Is there something wrong?

320
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,007
I borrowed money from her.

321
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,515
What?

322
00:20:57,515 --> 00:21:01,620
Planning to get a divorce and taking
Hun abroad to study,

323
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,490
I applied for a loan with the agency.

324
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,380
But I never dreamed it was a scam.

325
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,091
You took out a loan? Seriously?

326
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,619
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

327
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,116
I didn't know it was a big deal.

328
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,747
I thought it was okay as your sister.

329
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,753
Have you lost your mind?

330
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:26,253
I'm really sorry.

331
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,387
Then, Min Ju explained everything.

332
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:34,540
That it's breaking the law unless
it's your immediate family.

333
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,076
Saying that I should pay it off,

334
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:40,875
she lent me the money.

335
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,485
But then, now...

336
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,422
- You came.
- Yes.

337
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,226
We could just stay here.

338
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,411
It's all right.

339
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,042
You should get back.

340
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,581
This must be tough on you.

341
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,791
I find it hard to face her parents.

342
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,895
What are you talking about?

343
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:07,182
You and Min Ju faced death together.

344
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,743
That says it all.

345
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:09,806
Yes.

346
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:13,357
Now you can be happy together
after she wakes up.

347
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:16,248
So, hang in there.

348
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:17,902
Thank you.

349
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:20,397
Please look after her well.

350
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:21,448
Okay.

351
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:25,927
Bye.

352
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:09,156
It seems to be your wedding.

353
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,864
One, two, three.

354
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:14,544
How about here?

355
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:17,318
It's really nice.

356
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,749
Do you want to have a wedding here?

357
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:21,440
What are you saying?
Let’s look somewhere else.

358
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:24,825
So am I a part of your family now?

359
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,767
I want to wake up together,

360
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:31,895
sleep together, eat together,
and travel together.

361
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,069
I want to share those moments.

362
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,232
Because of you.

363
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,071
I feel the same way.

364
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:15,498
(SBC)

365
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,585
Why are they hitting the brakes
on our production?

366
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,544
They are claiming the hotel fire...

367
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,448
was because of something we did.

368
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:25,167
What? That's absurd.

369
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,384
The police investigation revealed...

370
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,111
the air conditioner condenser in my room
is what started the fire.

371
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,200
But the hotel is evading
all responsibility...

372
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,893
and trying to blame it on our team.

373
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:38,026
How could they do this?

374
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,835
The hotel's facility was the problem.

375
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,187
How does that involve us?

376
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:42,590
That's exactly what I'm saying.

377
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,632
- What should we do now?
- Look here!

378
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,135
What's all this about?

379
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:48,983
Why is the production on hold?

380
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,965
They can't do this. It's absurd.

381
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:56,772
These guys are going rogue
without Gang Min Ju.

382
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:59,716
I'll look into it and set things straight.

383
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:02,980
Yes, you take care of it.

384
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,021
But our argument would even matter...

385
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,078
if the hotel doesn't take responsibility.

386
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:10,964
What's so wrong about
leaving the air conditioner on?

387
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:14,870
This is obviously a problem
with the hotel's facilities.

388
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,103
Gang Min Ju.

389
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:23,807
Can you see me? Do you recognize me?

390
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:41,420
This is good.

391
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,950

are back to normal.

392
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,556

00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:50,598
I'm grateful you came back to me.

395
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,324
How are you feeling?

396
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,563
I'm fine.

397
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:14,979
But are you really okay?

398
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:17,083
Look.

399
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:21,349
I'm all better, thanks to your concern.

400
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,037
All right.

401
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:25,547
While I was asleep,

402
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,206
I continued to dream about you.

403
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:35,211
My mind was focused on you
while I was awake.

404
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:39,507
It's like a dream to meet your gaze.

405
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:48,297
We're being held responsible for the fire,

406
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:50,688
which could suspend our production.

407
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:53,592
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

408
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,850
You focus on getting your rest.

409
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,457
You barely ate. Have some more.

410
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,537
I'm finished.

411
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:07,958
While I was lying unconscious,

412
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,699
you must have been anxious
with my parents here.

413
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,082
I felt guilty and anxious.

414
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:19,048
But with you up and healthy,

415
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,762
it's like I'm backed by an army.

416
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,265
- Mom.
- Min Ju.

417
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,754
Dad, my goodness.

418
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:29,129
Min Ju.

419
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:31,147
- Let me look at you.
- I'm okay.

420
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:32,904
Are you sure you're okay?

421
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,338
Have you pulled through?

422
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:35,785
I'm okay now.

424
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,627
Min Ju, does it hurt anywhere?

425
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:41,373
I'm okay. Sorry about this.

426
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,698
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

427
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,408
Yes, I know.

428
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:50,458
You met a nice guy, like you said.

429

What's this?

436
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,450
Having you shoulder the blame
for the ferry issue...

437
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,255
doesn't make any sense.

438
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:20,974
What?

439
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:25,165
So, I have lodged a formal
petition in my name.

440
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,382
Luckily, they said it could help...

441
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:29,472
with your objection to the audit findings.

442
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,565
Thank you, Deputy Mayor.

443
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:36,126
No need. It's only right.

444
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,663
After you sign the papers,

445
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,090
have it submitted with your objection.

446
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:42,419

(Expert Assessment
Regarding the Ferry Issue)

449
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:59,434
Professor Ma sent me a file today.

450
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:09,700
It looks like you've come prepared.

451
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,161
Did you suspend the production?

452
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:14,882
The drama staff caused a fire
at such a fancy hotel.

453
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,490
That's hard to ignore.

454
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,862
At least there were no casualties, right?

455
00:29:19,862 --> 00:29:22,095
Someone waived the hotel inspection,

456
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,701
which could have killed people
from faulty facilities.

457
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,094
I won't let it go, so be prepared.

458
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:38,670
What's this?

459
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:42,537
Chief Ko Sang Sik's sister...

460
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:44,218
has used her brother's name...

461
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,132
to take a public loan.

462
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,979
She isn't his immediate family,

463
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:52,523
but carried it out without his consent.

464
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:55,299
So this constitutes document forgery,

465
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,854
which merits punishment.

466
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:00,778
By not keeping his family in line...

467
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:03,386
and allowing his identity to be misused,

468
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:07,213
he has undermined the dignity
of public service.

469
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,795
And to uncover any possible gains...

470
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:14,962
from exploiting his name and position,

471
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:16,829
the case should be
thoroughly investigated.

472
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:18,803
I object.

473
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,250
State your case.

474
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,898
The agency's fraudulent actions...

475
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:23,882
have been confirmed by the police.

476
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:27,889
And my sister and I are merely victims.

477
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:30,043
Making such groundless claims...

478
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:32,451
brings his integrity into question.

479
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,900
Please refrain from such remarks.

480
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:36,046
Integrity?

481
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,246
As Chief Ko's records indicate,

482
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:46,003
he was an assistant producer
at the KBN network.

483
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:50,019
His oversight caused a fire on set,

484
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,453
which led to someone's death.

485
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:54,674
That incident...

486
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:57,813
took place before my public service.

487
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,857
This could offer a perspective
about his character,

488
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:03,145
which is of grave concern.

489
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,434
I ask for your consideration.

490
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:06,725
Chief Ko, present your case.

491
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,194
First, this document...

492
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:12,273
is evidence that Director Shin...

493
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:15,258
colluded with grape importers
at the grape festival...

494
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:18,676
and replaced the local grapes
with cheap imports.

495
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,138
You can see the witness statements...

496
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:24,588
and exact quantities of grapes.

497
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:26,122
What?

498
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,769
This confirms the manipulated ferry bid...

499
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,915
and the illicit licensing of a hotel
that recently caught fire.

500
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:34,427
The beneficiary of the ferry bid...

501
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,778
was named Gong Koo Sik.

502
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:38,491
He is the same individual behind
Cheongsong House,

503
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,587
which was questionably licensed.

504
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:43,226
Director Shin favored him in the bidding,

505
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:46,330
and approved the license of his hotel
despite inadequate facilities...

506
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,050
and remaining safety concerns.

507
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,323
Are you crazy?

508
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,114
What are you talking about?

509
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,001
And this USB.

510
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:59,747
For the Woori City Drama selection,

511
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:02,377
Director Shin promised a reward
for rigged scores.

512
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,529
This has his double contract...

513
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:06,515
and a recording of that agreement.

514
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:11,111
How did you get that?

515
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,335
Substituted grapes, manipulated bids,

516
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:16,791
tampered scores, and illicit licensing.

517
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,871
I have only scratched the surface.

518
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,591
Since there could be more concealed,

519
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,723
I hope you conduct an investigation.

520
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,248
- Chief Ko.
- Yes?

521
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,749
How did your objection hearing go?

522
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,519
It's all been straightened out.

523
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,956
All straightened out?

524
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:43,956
Yes.

525
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,309
What's going on?

526
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,133
For bribery, embezzlement,
and corruption charges,

527
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,373
you are under arrest.

528
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:57,405
What?

529
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:00,587
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

530
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:01,646
Arrest him.

531
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,077
Let me go. Let go!

532
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:10,676
I'll get you for this!

533
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:12,082
You bastard!

534
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:14,563
Let me go!

535
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:15,677
Let go!

536
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:20,162
My goodness.

537
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:23,902
I didn't realize that he was such
an impressive person.

538
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,750
We need more people like him
to improve our society.

539
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:35,084
And since he loves and adores Min Ju,

540
00:33:35,084 --> 00:33:36,880
I won't have to worry anymore.

541
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,824
She is in good hands.

542
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:41,082
Mom, what are you saying?

543
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:44,849
You're back.

544
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,942
You did great today.

545
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,989
How are you feeling?

546
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:50,049
As you can see, I can go home.

547
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,514
- Really?
- Yes.

548
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,503
Min Ju has told me...

549
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:58,919
that you share a special bond.

550
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,664
Since you have survived this together,

551
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,426
I won't have to lecture you anymore.

552
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:09,418
I'm glad to see that you deeply
care for each other.

553
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:11,612
Thank you.

554
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:15,413
Your parents have passed away,
but what about the rest?

555
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:18,525
Are you living in that house
with your siblings?

556
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,940
Mom, why are you asking that?

557
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,682
You should consider marriage
since you make a good pair.

558
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:28,730
I have two younger sisters.

559
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,250
One sister lives with her husband,

560
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,067
but the other lives with me
since she's single.

561
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:38,204
And I have a daughter.

562
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:40,138
A daughter?

563
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:42,802
Mom, have an apple.

564
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,641
Do you have a daughter?

565
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:47,148
Yes, she's in 8th grade.

566
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:51,470
So, you've got a daughter.

567
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:56,436
Well, that's not a big deal.

568
00:34:56,915 --> 00:35:01,386
Then you should take more time
about marriage.

569
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:02,745
Right, Min Ju?

570
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:05,570
Mom, we'll let you know after.

571
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:07,555
Okay.

572
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,427
What are you still doing here?

573
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:18,704
The production is on hold,
so just head home.

574
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:21,385
This can't possibly be the end.

575
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,624
You know, I'm gearing up for a new drama.

576
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,456
Why don't you pitch me ideas?

577
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,530
Producer Han.

578
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,440
What?

579
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,863
I heard you will have
a disciplinary hearing.

580
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:35,864
Me? That's absurd.

581
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:38,143
Haven't you heard the rumor?

582
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,857
They say it's about rigging scores
for the Woori City Drama.

583
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:42,265
For rigging scores?

584
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,458
No, I know nothing about that.

585
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,516
It's here.

586
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,908
Woori City just dropped a notice.

587
00:35:48,908 --> 00:35:50,922
The production is back on.

588
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:51,984
Really?

589
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,522
- Are you serious?
- That's great.

590
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:56,950
It's thanks to Chief Ko
and Producer Gang's teamwork.

591
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,516
That's such great news.

592
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:01,386
Right.

593
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,719
Okay, let's prepare for the shoots.

594
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:08,729
- Gi Cheol, you should step it up.
- Of course.

595
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:12,178
You should also take my views.

596
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:13,930
I don't know about that.

597
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,280
Mi Rye, at the karaoke last time,

598
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,714
I was out of line and messed up.

599
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:21,146
It's okay, you were drunk that day.

600
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,442
I realize that.

601
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,185
So until we're done with filming,

602
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:27,383
I'm staying off the booze.

603
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:29,740
By the way, Boss gets home today.

604
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:33,166
My brother's got it covered.

605
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,897
Shall we start our meeting?

606
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:46,880
It's nice to be back home.

607
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:51,105
Do your parents like your place?

608
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,151
Of course.

609
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:58,640
I was going to say this later.

610
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:02,888
Did you lend Sang Hee some money?

611
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:05,678
Well...

612
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:07,776
Sang Hee told me. Why did you?

613
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:09,583
What do you mean why?

614
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,238
I'll pay it back right away.

615
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:13,695
Don't ever do that again, okay?

616
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:19,317
No matter how tough it gets,

617
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:23,096
we don't borrow money or stir trouble.

618
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,398
It wasn't any trouble.

619
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:26,694
No.

620
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:29,519
No money transactions with my family.

621
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,033
Can't I even buy ice cream for Ye Ji?

622
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:35,848
You should get back.

623
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:39,785
Don't be too hard on Sang Hee.

624
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:41,202
All right.

625
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,602
Here is your tea.

626
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:53,659
Where is Dad?

627
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,084
He already went to bed.

628
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:57,931
Are you sure his health is okay?

629
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:01,998
It won't get any better,

630
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:03,920
but I'll keep it from getting worse.

631
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:07,471
I've played cards with him lately.

632
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,336
You?

633
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:17,487
We're old, so you're what matters.

634
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:20,811
What about me?

635
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:22,678
How do you like your neighbor?

636
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,679
He seems like a good guy,

637
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:28,464
even though he has a daughter.

638
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:32,292
I really like him.

639
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:35,083
- Really?
- Yes.

640
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,438
Then, marry him. Why wait?

641
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,243
Well, he does have a lot
of family members.

642
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:43,778
Is that why?

643
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:45,482
No.

644
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:48,268
It feels too late for marriage now.

645
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:51,001
That's just a formality.

646
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,569
What are you even saying?

647
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:55,569
Even in their 60s or 70s,

648
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,493
people marry multiple times these days.

649
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:01,564
So, give it some thought.

650
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,148
Okay, all right.

651
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,387
Aunt Mi Rye.

652
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,218
Where are you going?

653
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,394
What?

654
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,893
I'm going to Jun Woo's room.

655
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:20,882
Why are you down here?

656
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:23,064
To drink water.

657
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,248
I see.

658
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:27,501
I hear you practice dancing
at the entertainment agency.

659
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:31,763
Well, I must compete and get selected.

660
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:34,130
I'll share if there is good news.

661
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,130
Okay.

662
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:37,979
Drink your water.

663
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,420
Okay. Night.

664
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,740
She's been acting weird lately.

665
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:51,672
Why are you here?

666
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,913
I couldn't sleep.

667
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,111
Why does it seem like you sneaked in here?

668
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:59,719
It felt awkward coming to your room.

669
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,815
What?

670
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,655
You used to barge in all the time.

671
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:06,366
I was working and wanted a drink.

672
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,606
Here, have a drink.

673
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:08,967
- No.
- Why not?

674
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,831
I need to get groceries in the morning.

675
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:14,061
So, have a drink and sleep well.

676
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:17,155
Here, I'll pour you a glass.

677
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,082
You're no fun.

678
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:28,408
You've been studying a bit lately.

679
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:31,231
Well, it's for the Woori City Drama.

680
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:36,609
And I got an invitation from Canada.

681
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:37,617
Really?

682
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,961
You know George Brown College,
known for culinary arts?

683
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,418
They asked me to give lectures there.

684
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:47,606
Here.

685
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,127
My goodness, that's amazing.

686
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:55,170
You're in high demand after
making the top ten.

687
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,731
What's this?

688
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,298
You don't seem to be happy for me.

689
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:01,437
No, congratulations.

690
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:04,373
Why? Are you sad to say goodbye?

691
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:09,427
It'll take about five years.

692
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:10,830
Five years?

693
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:13,479
Wait a minute.

694
00:41:14,443 --> 00:41:17,318
What? Are you counting your age?

695
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:20,375
- Jun Woo.
- Ko Mi Rye.

696
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,223
Do you want to come with me?

697
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:32,047
Hiccups?

698
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,287
Uncle Jun Woo.

699
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:37,014
Yes, what?

700
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,476
Where is the fruit in the fridge?

701
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:41,917
What fruit?

702
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,673
What is Aunt Mi Rye doing?

703
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,816
Are you hiding from me?

704
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,606
I was stretching.

705
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,981
Take care of yourself.

706
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,341
And call me if you get sick.

707
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,781
Yes, okay.

708
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,541
I wish you could stay longer.

709
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:05,877
It's a shame.

710
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:07,711
I wish we could stick around.

711
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:11,087
I'll make time this winter to visit.

712
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,983
Okay, you can visit together.

713
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:14,663
Yes, we'll do that.

714
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,133
Take care of Min Ju for me.

715
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:20,942
Don't worry.

716
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,787
I'll make sure nothing happens
to worry you again.

717
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:25,957
Let's not be late for your flight.

718
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,165
Okay.

719
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:30,997
Mom, don't worry. I'll manage, okay?

720
00:42:30,997 --> 00:42:34,966
One always worries about their kids.

721
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,277
Dad, please be well.

722
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:41,590
Sure.

723
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,271
- It's this way.
- Okay.

724
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:55,577
They must be on the plane now.

725
00:42:55,577 --> 00:42:57,053
Yes, I think so.

726
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:01,787
Your folks are nice.
I wouldn't mind living with them.

727
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,781
That's kind of you to say.

728
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,602
Why don't you ask them to move back?

729
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:11,211
Since my dad worked there
before he got retired,

730
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,843
he's more accustomed to it.

731
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,822
I guess that, at their age,

732
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:16,813
it's not easy to move around.

733
00:43:16,813 --> 00:43:20,163
Even I'm starting to find it hard.

734
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:23,399
I want to stay put for a long time.

735
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,098
Your folks seemed uneasy
about my daughter.

736
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:33,299
They are struggling to realize
I'm not young anymore.

737
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,799
Does it hurt anywhere, like your legs?

738
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:40,615
I'm a bit sore, but it's okay.

739
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:41,720
Really?

740
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,455
Don't keep it to yourself.

741
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,943
You should tell me when it hurts.

742
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:47,864
Remember what your mother said.

743
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:54,536
Yes?

744
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,200
That's me.

745
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,048
Really?

746
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:08,007
Yes, all right.

747
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:11,641
Why? Is something wrong?

748
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:14,225
No.

749
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,656
It's okay. You can tell me.

750
00:44:21,502 --> 00:44:24,512
His mother passed away.

751
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,143
(The late Park Sook Hee)

752
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,766
(The late Jang Eun Ho)

753
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:20,628
It's strange.

754
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:23,619
What is?

755
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:28,396
The moment Ms. Jang passed away...

756
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:32,373
coincided with when I became conscious.

757
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:41,836
Do you think she took your place?

758
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,820
That could be possible.

759
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:52,270
I was thinking the same thing.

760
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:56,833
To bring us together,

761
00:45:58,786 --> 00:46:04,084
Eun Ho could have welcomed his mother.

762
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:06,877
To bury the past...

763
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:10,526
and to start our new journey.

764
00:46:12,634 --> 00:46:14,477
It seems that he's telling us that.

765
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,357
We should.

766
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:21,981
Both of us.

767
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:24,893
Let's do that now.

768
00:46:27,553 --> 00:46:29,460
You once told me this.

769
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,627
Today reflects the past,

770
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:37,517
and tomorrow is the trace of today.

771
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:44,869
Our past, present, and future
seem to be bound together...

772
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,773
with an invisible string.

773
00:46:49,427 --> 00:46:50,427
Yes.

774
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,668
In our lives,

775
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:57,630
everything happens for a reason.

776
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:02,917
Whether good or bad,

777
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:07,155
there is always meaning, and it helps.

778
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:15,970
Days stack up to shape our lives,

779
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,130
and that's how we age.

780
00:47:20,593 --> 00:47:23,802
There are surprises along the way,

781
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:27,099
and we sometimes catch luck.

782
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:30,898
That's how we age.

783
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:35,051
It's as if each day comes with meaning.

784
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:39,720
Today is when we are the youngest
in our life,

785
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,579
and tomorrow is new from yesterday.

786
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,863
Ms. Ko.

787
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:58,124
Yes?

788
00:47:58,124 --> 00:47:59,734
Are you nervous about something?

789
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,281
Well.

790
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:04,109
Yes.

791
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:05,657
You must be incredibly anxious.

792
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,727
What are you making this time?

793
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,693
It's a zebra.

794
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:11,825
Zebra?

795
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:15,295
That's amazing.

796
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,653
Can I give it a try?

797
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:18,653
Sure.

798
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:20,651
Thank you.

799
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,656
Okay, like this.

800
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:30,776
Done.

801
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,400
- What do you think?
- You did great.

802
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:38,372
How pretty.

803
00:48:38,372 --> 00:48:39,920
What's troubling you?

804
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,605
Jun Woo.

805
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:46,727
Jun Woo? What about him?

806
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,173
There is a famous culinary college...

807
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:52,808
that invited him to give lectures.

808
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:56,082
Really? That's great news.

809
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:02,850
Right, so that's why you're feeling down.

810
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,331
I can't ask him not to go...

811
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:07,568
or be glad about him leaving.

812
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:08,703
How about you join him?

813
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:10,358
Of course, after our drama ends.

814
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:13,134
No, I've got my own work.

815
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:15,693
I want to stay here as a webtoon artist.

816
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:18,529
Work or love, that's the question.

817
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,210
Love?

818
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,053
Isn't that what it is?

819
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:27,867
After being friends since we were kids,

820
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,601
I'm not sure what to think.

821
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:33,172
It makes me feel kind of guilty.

822
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:36,413
That's because you're not kids anymore.

823
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:39,119
You should lay it out with Jun Woo.

824
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:45,045
Ms. Ko, did you make this?

825
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:46,262
Yes.

826
00:49:46,262 --> 00:49:48,848
Can I keep it as a keepsake?

827
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:49,848
Sure.

828
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:53,058
Ms. Ko, what's got you feeling down today?

829
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,420
You look heartbroken.

830
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,849
Heartbroken?

831
00:49:57,849 --> 00:49:59,155
No.

832
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:01,240
Since Ms. Ko made it herself,

833
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,713
You should carry it around
like a lucky charm.

834
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,681
That sounds like a plan.

835
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:08,745
You don't know when to give up.

836
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:10,881
It's great to be young. Work hard.

837
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:12,195
- Bye.
- Bye.

838
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:15,119
Following deceptive marketing tactics...

839
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,534
and enticing people to accept loans,

840
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:19,305
- That man...
- Mr. Lee and his associates,

841
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:22,034
who scammed millions through
their study program,

842
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:24,210
have been arrested today.

843
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,298
Yes, Detective Gang. I saw the news.

844
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:28,723
I appreciate your effort.

845
00:50:29,657 --> 00:50:32,660
Yes, I'll come with my sister.

846
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:40,908
Sang Sik?

847
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:46,971
- You're home.
- Where are you going?

848
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:49,267
To the police station.

849
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:51,427
The police station?

850
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,484
What's this?

851
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,675
Are they Mi Rye's fans?

852
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:10,945
- I have a way.
- What?

853
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:14,273
You can make webtoons in Canada
and upload them online.

854
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:16,435
I disagree. After chasing a man,

855
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,857
you might lose yourself
from tending to his needs.

856
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:21,368
You could learn to cook there.

857
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:24,165
There are plenty of men out there.

858
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,917
Ms. Ko isn't answering.

859
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,615
She must be really upset.

860
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:36,222
What's up?

861
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:38,501
What? I'm just here for my laptop.

862
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:39,784
I see.

863
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:42,727
Ko Mi Rye.

864
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:45,077
Yes?

865
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:58,550
Sit down for a moment.

866
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,050
Now, listen closely.

867
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:16,230
When I'm feeling happy now,

868
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:20,216
I come to you first.

869
00:52:23,149 --> 00:52:24,365
Really?

870
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:25,365
Yes.

871
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:28,591
And when I'm feeling down,

872
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:32,958
I'll confide in you first.

873
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:39,927
Whether it's anger or joy,

874
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:45,552
I'll share my load with you.

875
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:49,185
Jun Woo.

876
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,268
Yes.

877
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:56,776
If something happens to me,

878
00:52:58,013 --> 00:52:59,918
who will I think of?

879
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:03,749
The first person that comes to mind...

880
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:07,343
is someone special in my heart.

881
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:11,077
To me,

882
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:15,901
that's you, Ko Mi Rye.

883
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:23,933
So, from now on,

884
00:53:25,683 --> 00:53:27,525
don't assume this is a crush.

885
00:53:33,426 --> 00:53:35,861
Why are you so cool like this?

886
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,629
You only see it that way.

887
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,781
I can wait for five or ten years.

888
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:01,460
You don't have to wait.

889
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:03,559
Should I come with you?

890
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,835
Want to live together?

891
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:09,270
Yes.

892
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:12,253
Don't go.

893
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,965
Where would I go without you?

894
00:54:26,924 --> 00:54:28,260
Sang Hee, are you all right?

895
00:54:29,051 --> 00:54:32,217
I'm sorry about all this.

896
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:34,569
You don't have to apologize.

897
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:39,626
I really didn't know it was a crime.

898
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:40,979
Well, you know it now.

899
00:54:42,897 --> 00:54:44,969
You didn't know any better,

900
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:47,856
and it was a fraudulent scheme.

901
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:49,911
Now, with the scammers caught,

902
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,295
the court will likely consider all that.

903
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:55,977
Yes, just don't do it again.

904
00:54:56,462 --> 00:55:00,063
Sang Sik, I didn't intend any of this.

905
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,692
I was only looking out for Hun.

906
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:04,453
Yes, I know.

907
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:08,237
Your husband will get a piece of my mind.

908
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,209
Let's go.

909
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,930
Hun should come over,

910
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,250
and let's treat him with fried chicken.

911
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,294
Okay?

912
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:22,513
Okay, let's eat.

913
00:55:22,513 --> 00:55:24,751
Yay, it's fried chicken!

914
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:26,226
Thank you.

915
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,312
Mom, take a piece.

916
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:31,376
You can have all of it.

917
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,388
Come on.

918
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:35,308
Dad, give this to Mom.

919
00:55:42,114 --> 00:55:43,804
Hun won't eat unless you do.

920
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,632
I love how it's greasy with a spicy kick.

921
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:52,879
- Have some.
- Have some.

922
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:56,182
You two are looking great.

923
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,070
We were like that as newlyweds.

924
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:00,996
Isn't that right?

925
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,276
If you want to apologize, do it right.

926
00:56:11,123 --> 00:56:12,299
Dad.

927
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:17,092
Mom likes chicken wings.

928
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:19,029
This is a bigger piece.

929
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:42,454
Honey, you should have some.

930
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,950
I don't want any.

931
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,768
Hun said you like chicken wings,

932
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:48,436
so I picked them all out.

933
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:49,659
Chicken wings?

934
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,757
They remind me of your wingless angel.

935
00:56:54,306 --> 00:56:56,893
Let's just drop that topic.

936
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:00,492
It's not whether you slept together...

937
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:03,398
but whether you opened up to her.

938
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:05,405
We were just friends.

939
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,062
Feeling lonely inside,

940
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:09,759
I just had casual conversations.

941
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:12,526
Wanting what's best for Hun,

942
00:57:12,526 --> 00:57:15,049
I even took out a loan in secret.

943
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:18,331
But I told you that wasn't an option.

944
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:22,395
When I was juggling all that, you...

945
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:26,226
This will only wear you down.

946
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,163
Yes, it won't get any better.

947
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:35,660
I want a divorce.

948
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,888
Divorce?

949
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:40,488
Why? You thought I'd never consider it?

950
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,545
Hun will stay with me,

951
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,555
so you can send me child support fees.

952
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:49,987
Are you serious about this?

953
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:51,405
Yes.

954
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,862
Let's get a divorce.

955
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:59,522
I thought you wanted to meet
over the weekend.

956
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:04,684
It felt like time was running short,

957
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:05,926
and I got anxious.

958
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:08,892
What are you talking about?

959
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:11,559
You're still young and pretty.

960
00:58:12,149 --> 00:58:14,956
What with Chief Ko's issues,

961
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:16,813
we have overcome something big.

962
00:58:18,164 --> 00:58:21,942
You worked hard, Deputy Mayor.

963
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,621
Thanks.

964
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:28,004
Even if we don't get married,

965
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,677
I'm grateful we have this relationship.

966
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:37,411
Life could change in an instant.

967
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:38,971
So you never know.

968
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,823
Yes, so be good to me today.

969
00:58:43,507 --> 00:58:44,715
Would you like that?

970
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:45,732
Wait a minute.

971
00:58:46,905 --> 00:58:48,049
I'm sorry.

972
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,073
I have to close up now.

973
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:52,139
I apologize.

974
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:03,971
Why did you kick everyone out?

975
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:11,067
Do you want to dance?

976
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:20,560
I had one son.

977
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,699
However,

978
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:27,396
I lost him to an illness a few years ago.

979
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,464
My wife couldn't bear the loss...

980
00:59:32,926 --> 00:59:34,657
and followed him soon after.

981
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,843
My word, really?

982
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:42,365
That's when I started this bar.

983
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:45,150
What did you do before that?

984
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:49,013
I went around here and there,

985
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:54,137
painting stuff and selling pottery.

986
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,011
So, there is an artist in you.

987
00:59:58,185 --> 01:00:01,092
I expected to live my life alone.

988
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:04,525
But you came to me like this,

989
01:00:05,387 --> 01:00:07,037
and that means a lot.

990
01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:10,789
You've set the mood today.

991
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,037
That's who I am.

992
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:28,621
How about you live with me
until we're fed up?

993
01:00:30,481 --> 01:00:35,116
Are you proposing to me?

994
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:01,421
Isn't that too intense?

995
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:04,269
It seems over the top.

996
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:05,914
Cut.

997
01:01:05,914 --> 01:01:08,436
That's good, but one more time.

998
01:01:08,436 --> 01:01:10,461
Tone it down a little, okay?

999
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:20,111
Where are you?

1000
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:26,127
I'm at the filming location.

1001
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:28,551
When do you get off work?

1002
01:01:29,575 --> 01:01:30,665
Why?

1003
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,855
I have something important to say.

1004
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,951
I'll call when it's over.

1005
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:06,564
What is it?

1006
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:10,515
Every day is too precious.

1007
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:16,958
I can't waste another hour,
minute, or second.

1008
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:22,056
That's because we nearly died.

1009
01:02:23,812 --> 01:02:24,812
Yes.

1010
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:33,062
Is that what you wanted to say?

1011

No.

While keeping true to myself,

1016
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:05,627
I want to spend the rest of my days
with you.
