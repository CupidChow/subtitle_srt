1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,049
(The Grape Festival)

2
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,006
- My goodness!
- What happened?

3
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,215
Are you okay?

4
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:05,241
Something came up.

5
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:06,426
Get back if it's urgent.

6
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:09,090
I'll stay here until the rain lets up.

7
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,335
Let's go. I'll take you back.

8
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,093
No, I'm totally fine.

9
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,643
Then I'll call you later.

10
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:38,705
You get over there.

11
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,027
I'll head that way.

12
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,097
Are you done with everything?

13
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:47,585
What are you still doing here?

14
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,599
Can you get back now?

15
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,843
Of course.

16
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,145
Then let's go together.

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,144
I'm soaked through and through, anyway.

18
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:03,689
This won't do.

19
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,114
Why not?

20
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,730
It's the heart that counts.

21
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:27,553
What does age matter? Why can't you date?

22
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:30,619
Family matters, but you come first.

23
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,602
What are you doing?

24
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,136
Let's run!

25
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,355
Are you okay?

26
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,206
That scared me.

27
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:19,351
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

28
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,888
What?

29
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,888
Why are you laughing?

30
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:26,506
This is fun.

31
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,979
I'm glad you're having fun.

32
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,634
What is this place?

33
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:38,380
It's a storage space for the event.

34
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,493
Come this way.

35
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,806
I didn't know such a place existed.

36
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:56,787
I came up with it.

37
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,422
This thing? Really?

38
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,579
It's a rest spot for tourists.

39
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,391
It's amazing.

40
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,370
How tasty, it's super sweet.

41
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,491
Try some.

42
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,051
I'm good.

43
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,952
It should be okay washed in the rain.

44
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,781
The rain here is different
from that of Seoul.

45
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:31,976
The grapes burst with juice.

46
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:33,770
Are they that delicious?

47
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,852
Here.

48
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,814
Let me have a taste.

49
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:40,710
I figured as much.

50
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,631
The rain won't let up anytime soon.

51
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,031
Anyway, what brings you to the festival?

52
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,968
Now I'm a resident of Woori City.

53
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,143
Good grief.

54
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,007
The sticker is on my car.

55
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,007
What?

56
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,417
"New car. Keep your distance."

57
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:12,084
I keep a safe distance, so don't worry.

58
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,565
It's a team effort to avoid accidents.

59
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,908
Drive smart and stay alert.

60
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,872
Or pray that you don't crash your car.

61
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:22,897
As long as your family is careful,
that won't be necessary.

62
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:27,544
Nobody asked to be your neighbor.

63
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:30,581
I kick myself for not doing
my research before.

64
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,451
And yet you stayed behind
to help with the festival.

65
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,571
I feel bad when my neighbor has it hard.

66
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,875
Did you call me your neighbor?

67
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,697
What's wrong with that?

68
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,265
Nothing.

69
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,264
This is sweet.

70
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,028
Your house got robbed by a burglar?

71
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,521
You don't believe me, do you?

72
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,258
Then come and see for yourself.

73
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,843
The house is a mess.

74
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,508
It was around this time last year.

75
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,331
"Min Ji Seon visiting from Canada
is looking for you urgently."

76
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,178
"Do you know who she is?"

77
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:22,412
The call was from this police station.

78
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,469
It was raining cats and dogs like today.

79
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:30,913
I was excited and curious about you.

80
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,765
And I rushed in the downpour,
worried about you.

81
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,797
But I should have turned you away.

82
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,625
Jun.

83
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,593
Regardless of your situation that day,

84
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,987
I should have given you a meal
and put you on a flight.

85
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,952
No, I won't go back.

86
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,569
There is no way that will happen.

87
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,249
Then you might as well get settled.

88
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:55,268
Why are you troubling me like this?

89
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,179
You bastard.

90
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:00,253
You're all I have got.

91
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,034
I'm here all by myself.

92
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,884
Completely alone in this world.

93
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,101
Jun!

94
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,052
Don't leave, Jun!

95
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,077
Come back!

96
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,426
Jun!

97
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:29,373
Don't go! Please don't leave!

98
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:40,296
Good heavens, it's been so many years.

99
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,314
You're looking good.

100
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,894
I'm glad to see you back.

101
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,480
Let's go.

102
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,457
Why are you still awake?

103
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:03,339
Just because. I'm feeling grateful.

104
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,933
My mom was all the family I had.

105
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:10,309
But once she got married again,

106
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,216
I couldn't stand being alone there.

107
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:13,997
My word.

108
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,941
Park Jun Woo, you're not alone.

109
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,181
You're a part of this family.

110
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:23,321
We're the kind that misses you
when you're not around.

111
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:28,350
People sometimes think they are alone,

112
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,365
but nobody is truly alone in this world.

113
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,970
(Second to Last Love)

114
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,355
(Episode 5)

115
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,400
- Hello, Jun Woo.
- Sang Sik, are you okay?

116
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,560
What do you mean? About what?

117
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,518
Is the festival okay with the downpour?

118
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,631
It is nothing to fret over.

119
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,648
Who else would worry about you?

120
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:34,356
Yes, it wrapped up nicely.

121
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:35,478
Where are you?

122
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,055
Yes, okay.

123
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,275
My goodness.

124
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,003
It stopped raining.

125
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:51,070
(Park Jun Woo)

126
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,642
Whose call are you ignoring?

127
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:57,810
It's Jun Woo.

128
00:10:58,732 --> 00:10:59,732
Hello?

129
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,096
Sorry for bailing on you.
Did you get home well?

130
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,947
Sure, I made it back.

131
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,529
Did you sort things out? It seemed urgent.

132
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,913
No, don't worry about it.

133
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,417
The rain let up, so just go.

134
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,459
Okay.

135
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:22,055
Are you speaking casually now?

136
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:24,131
You seem close, like brother and sister.

137
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,375
Jun Woo is a friendly guy.

138
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:31,679
There is a rainbow.

139
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,481
How silly of me.

140
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,659
I'm excited about rainbows at this age.

141
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,299
What age is that?

142
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,839
People like me love a downpour...

143
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,202
when there is a rainbow after.

144
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,240
After hurrying over somewhere,

145
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,695
it's not like reaching a dead end...

146
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,576
and discovering an unexpected delight.

147
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:06,940
Having such a reward feels good.

148
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,572
Life can become exhausting
with such expectations.

149
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:16,078
Who we are now is a reflection
of the past,

150
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,956
and everyone reaps what they sow.

151
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,888
Do you have to be so serious? My goodness.

152
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:28,342
Let's go. It stopped raining.

153
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,612
Jun Woo, pour me some milk.

154
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,612
Okay.

155
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,997
Did you know that Min Ju
was at the festival?

156
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,495
I wonder if she returned okay
after I had to leave.

157
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,419
What's going on with her?

158
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,859
Min Ju?

159
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:51,867
Yes.

160
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,518
I really like her.

161
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,504
What? You don't approve?

162
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,327
But she's much older than you.

163
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,604
We decided to brush off
the backward stuff...

164
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:08,559
about our age difference
and social standing.

165
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:14,670
Do you mean she feels the same way?

166
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,391
It's just me now.

167
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:19,133
Good grief.

168
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,078
Why are you so into that woman?

169
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,971
She might not be your type,

170
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:25,403
but I find her amazing.

171
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,827
How should I put it?

172
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:29,282
Out of everyone I've been with,

173
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:32,556
she's the first woman who feels mature.

174
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:33,764
Mature?

175
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,360
Yes, that's how it feels.

176
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:41,380
You know how Mr. Wook
didn't show up, right?

177
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,435
Right.

178
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,236
When she saw people leaving
because he wasn't there,

179
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:48,389
she jumped into the stomping bin.

180
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,180
At first, I thought she wanted to try it.

181
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,864
But she worked hard trying to
get others to join her.

182
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,696
That's why all the wine sold out.

183
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,441
She really goes all out.

184
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:03,124
I find that amazing and sweet.

185
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,690
Goodness, you don't even know her well.

186
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,417
Is there a secret about her
that I don't know?

187
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,838
What secret? That's ridiculous.

188
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,579
Just don't make things awkward
with our new neighbor.

189
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:20,872
Okay.

190
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,030
Try this.

191
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,182
I squeezed some pomegranates
that I peeled by hand.

192
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:26,718
But I want milk.

193
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,224
What's he complaining about?

194
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,283
Whose call are you ignoring?

195
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,364
It's Jun Woo.

196
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,110
Sure, I made it back.

197
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,395
No, you don't have to worry.
It let up, so just go.

198
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:54,283
Why couldn't I say he was there?

199
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:56,909
Why?

200
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,094
What's this?

201
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,899
Why do I feel this way?

202
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,445
Let me tell you why.

203
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:43,874
You are ready to spread your wings.

204
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,793
Do you think I'm a dragon or something?

205
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,289
Don't push me off a cliff.

206
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,465
Exactly.

207
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,393
Life comes to an end that way.

208
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:52,250
I'm just worried about being lethargic...

209
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,208
after working in government all this time.

210
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,986
But what's this talk about life?

211
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,628
Do you know why life is short?

212
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,923
After preparing your whole life
to live to the fullest,

213
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:05,154
it's over when you feel ready.

214
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:06,524
Listen carefully.

215
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:12,575
After walking and standing upright
for more than 40 years,

216
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,054
even if people can't fly,

217
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:18,116
they should run around the world
as complete human beings.

218
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:20,813
But people in their 40s and 50s
these days...

219
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,401
are too caught up caring
for their kids and family,

220
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:26,883
so they end up falling behind
or losing themselves.

221
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,484
Just like turtles without legs.

222
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:36,419
Squirming inside their thick shell,

223
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,425
they yearn to break free, but get stuck.

224
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:42,402
Then giving up wears down the mind...

225
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,981
and fills hearts with doubt.

226
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,281
So what are you suggesting?

227
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:51,433
First, break out of your shell.

228
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,313
The wait has been long enough,

229
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,890
so you're ready to spread your wings.

230
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,626
Even if you want to squeeze
through your shell,

231
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:02,177
you'd get stuck after waiting too long.

232
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:05,828
After squirming around like that,
you'd kick the bucket.

233
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:12,005
You don't want to die, do you?

234
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,763
Of course not. We live in a great world.

235
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,123
Enjoying all there is to enjoy...

236
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,387
will make life worth remembering.

237
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,387
I don't even know if there is such joy.

238
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:31,924
Put it on my card.

239
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:38,121
Then find someone to share
your money with.

240
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,339
Someone you don't mind treating.

241
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,494
Get it? Okay?

242
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,750
Pistachios.

243
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,854
Quinoa.

244
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,529
Cayenne pepper.

245
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,443
Boursin cheese with basil.

246
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,201
Extra virgin olive oil.

247
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:04,465
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

248
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:07,984
Why are things so complicated?

249
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,282
I'd rather have instant noodles
and take the college entrance exam.

250
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,418
Watch out. You might spill it.

251
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm so hungry.

252
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,866
Hello. Hi, Ye Ji.

253
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,088
Hun, there you are.

254
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,890
It's okay to have a meal together
with the whole family.

255
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,803
We do it all the time. Hi.

256
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:28,689
What are you doing here?

257
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:29,810
I told you.

258
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,323
You can go ahead and eat.

259
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:33,589
- Hun, let's go.
- Hun, get me some rice.

260
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:34,621
Yes, sir.

261
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,590
Take a seat since you came.

262
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,523
I'll take up on that.

263
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:39,619
Why are you so nervous?

264
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,794
This is our family house that
welcomes everybody.

265
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:45,487
Take it easy and eat up.

266
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,275
What's going on? What happened?

267
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,907
You see, she went bankrupt.

268
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,614
Sweetheart.

269
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,876
- Bankrupt?
- Bankrupt?

270
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,222
No, what are you talking about?

271
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,158
What he meant is “on strike.”

272
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:01,986
Yes, I'm on strike. Right?

273
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:05,904
He's only teasing me about
my housework strike.

274
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,007
There wasn't any rice this morning.

275
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:10,663
How could you not know
you ran out of rice?

276
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,023
You're a homemaker, for goodness' sake!

277
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:13,072
Yes, I know.

278
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:16,118
After visiting Hun's teachers
about his grades,

279
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:17,366
I've been too distracted.

280
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,575
Well, it happens.

281
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,270
I run out of cafe ingredients at times.

282
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,367
Right, Jun Woo?

283
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,053
You're the only one who gets me.

284
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,003
Put that down!

285
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,461
I told you.

286
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,777
I already told you to put it down.

287
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,209
Why do you keep doing this to me?

288
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,272
My goodness!

289
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,705
You didn't even knock.

290
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,098
There's no need between us.

291
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,769
My heart sinks when I see you here.

292
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,003
- Why?
- What do you think?

293
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,915
That's how I always find out
about your troubles.

294
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:52,678
It's nothing like that.

295
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:54,574
Whatever. Don't tell me.

296
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:58,121
By the way, what happened
to the lease money from next door?

297
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,274
From the neighbor?

298
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:02,322
I have it safely in the bank.

299
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,019
No worries.

300
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,250
But you know what, Sang Sik?

301
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,683
What are you doing?

302
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:10,123
Why are you crawling back here
after getting married?

303
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:12,746
It's just that with the summer
season in full swing,

304
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:16,114
I need your help to cool down.

305
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,187
No. No way.

306
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,114
I told you last year was it.

307
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,759
Don't you dare this time.

308
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,922
I waited for summer all year long.

309
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,187
What's the harm in renting
my house to friends...

310
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,692
and earning some extra cash
on the holidays?

311
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,106
But when you rent out your house,

312
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,809
you always try to crash here
all through the summer.

313
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,914
I can do the cooking with Jun Woo.

314
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,580
I'll make cold bean soup noodles,
your favorite, every day.

315
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,274
- The house will be kept clean.
- Forget it.

316
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:40,920
Take your family to your place...

317
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,878
to eat, defecate, and clean all you want.

318
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,750
But I already accepted reservations
from my friends.

319
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,929
Sang Sik!

320
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,861
He'd better brace himself.

321
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,901
Look, there he comes.

322
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,615
The loser is over there!

323
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,747
How can you call yourself a civil servant?

324
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:02,703
What is going on here?

325
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,094
Chief Ko Sang Sik.

326
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,078
I never thought of you that way,
so how could you?

327
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:09,054
You favored Cheongsong Village.

328
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:11,182
Do you want the rest of us to starve?

329
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:14,343
What favor do you mean, Mr. Yang?

330
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:17,086
We did the math after the festival.

331
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:20,030
But it turns out Cheongsong Village
made double the profits what we did.

332
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,590
We all followed strict standards...

333
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,366
and sold the same amount
at the same prices.

334
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:28,055
But how come they made much more?

335
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,974
To give their sales a boost,

336
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:32,047
you must have upped their quantity.

337
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:34,973
As a civil servant, you should
have some conscience.

338
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,605
Why let some people sell more
while others can't?

339
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:39,349
I wouldn't do such a thing.

340
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:42,758
You came up with the festival
and took charge on-site.

341
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,238
How can you play dumb?

342
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,479
How are you going to fix this?

343
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,430
You said we could trust you!

344
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,920
What a complete bastard.

345
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,121
How could he do this to us?

346
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:53,283
Trust you?

347
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,741
- Good grief.
- Excuse me!

348
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:02,403
You must be complete cowards
to gang up on a person like that!

349
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,691
Just go, or you might get hurt.

350
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,464
Cowards? What's this woman?

351
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:10,527
She works for TV that makes
Mr. Wook's drama.

352
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,534
I saw her when they filmed here.

353
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:13,791
Yes, I remember.

354
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,888
Why didn't you have the star
appear at the festival?

355
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:19,872
You made scammers out of us!

356
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,679
You swindlers, you played us for fools.

357
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,575
My goodness.

358
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,677
Please don't cause any more trouble.

359
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,931
Wait a minute!

360
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:37,908
First of all, Mr. Wook didn't
show up as promised.

361
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,715
I sincerely apologize for that.

362
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:43,084
But resorting to violence like this
on a wayward path won't...

363
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:44,114
Stop it.

364
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:48,191
For whatever inconvenience
that I may have caused,

365
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,008
I apologize deeply.

366
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:52,846
I'll find out what happened
and get back to you.

367
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:54,824
We know it won't be of any use.

368
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:57,088
"There was no favor. I know nothing."

369
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:59,247
"Some farms managed it well."

370
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,401
"It's not a blow on other farmers."

371
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,375
You'll only say such nonsense.

372
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,144
Even if that's how things turn out,

373
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,207
we have to investigate the matter first.

374
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,489
If there was any unfair treatment,
I'll take responsibility...

375
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,190
and try to resolve the issue.

376
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:15,204
All right, this is enough. Let's go.

377
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,019
Can we really trust him?

378
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,891
I can't believe this.

379
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,336
Sometimes, things don't go as planned,

380
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:29,116
even when we start out
determined to do well.

381
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:31,335
Are you okay?

382
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,915
Yes. Are you hurt anywhere?

383
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:38,424
What's up?

384
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,116
Okay, I'm on my way.

385
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,545
Wait, you can't leave like this.

386
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,883
- There isn't time.
- Just stay still!

387
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:51,118
I'll handle the Mr. Wook situation.

388
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:53,723
Please don't.

389
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,652
Don't do anything.

390
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:58,074
Stop causing trouble and sit tight,
will you?

391
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,329
This is my responsibility.

392
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,970
Chief Ko.

393
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:18,145
Chief Ko, what happened to you?

394
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,125
(Planning Team C)

395
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:27,578
Boss, what's that on your dress?

396
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:28,741
What are you carrying?

397
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,426
Where is Mr. Wook?

398
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,838
I think he's at the set filming.

399
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:37,569
By the way, did you pick it up
from the dry cleaners?

400
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:38,645
Yes, I picked it up.

401
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,883
- Can you bring it here?
- Sure.

402
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,243
Yes, Mayor. I'll look into it
and call you back.

403
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,508
Yes, I apologize.

404
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,538
What in the world is this issue?

405
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:52,289
Privileges at a fraud festival?

406
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:55,001
Let's first have Chief Ko explain...

407
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,659
since he was working on-site.

408
00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:00,324
Why did Cheongsong Village farmers
achieve the highest sales?

409
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:06,232
I suspect there could have been
some kind of favoritism...

410
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,484
to increase sales for certain farmers.

411
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,969
What on Earth happened, Chief Ko?

412
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:18,667
I'm looking into it now.

413
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,873
"Mr. Wook didn't show up
at the scam festival."

414
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,329
"Chinese tourists that came
to see Mr. Wook..."

415
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,777
"are furious with complaints."

416
00:25:30,777 --> 00:25:32,633
"The person in charge is suspected..."

417
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,202
"to have favored certain villages
to increase their sales."

418
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,563
This is crazy.

419
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,175
What are we going to do?

420
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,432
Where is the Chief Ko?

421
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:43,472
No idea. He read the posts and left.

422
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,875
Director Shin is frantically
asking for him.

423
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:49,819
I feel bad for our Chief Ko.

424
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,624
It has improved exceedingly.

425
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:06,264
- Right?
- Well, yes.

426
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,313
I enjoyed it much better.

427
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,203
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

428
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:16,441
Who knew writing a drama
would be this challenging?

429
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,665
Have you ever done any co-writing?

430
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,891
Co-writing?

431
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:25,298
No, I haven't, and I don't want to.

432
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:29,738
I need someone who can add
color to your script.

433
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:33,195
I refuse. Don't tamper with my work.

434
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,694
I'd rather give up than do that.

435
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,334
Producer Han.

436
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,293
All right, I'll be there.

437
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,496
I'm busy, so let's talk later.

438
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:49,382
Good work.

439
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,749
- You worked hard.
- Good work.

440
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:54,551
Co-writing? She can't be serious.

441
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:00,276
What now? What's the matter?

442
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,669
We're in serious trouble.

443
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,909
- And who is this?
- Say hello.

444
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:07,914
This is Director Shin Seok Gi,
the Economics Culture Head of Woori City.

445
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:10,091
Don't be so formal.

446
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,267
We went to the same high school.

447
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:14,202
I see. I'm Gang Min Ju.

448
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:16,610
I've heard a lot about you.

449
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,940
He wasn't kidding about your looks.

450
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:22,214
When did I say that?

451
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,525
Why are you embarrassing me?

452
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,526
Come on.

453
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,981
Chief Ko.

454
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,031
What are you doing here?

455
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:43,484
This was it.

456
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,229
What is what?

457
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:53,607
What are you even sorting out?
They're all the same.

458
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:56,720
Go and find out which zone
made the most profits.

459
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,833
What?

460
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:07,679
No matter how many episodes are left,

461
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,881
we won't approve any more filming.

462
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,751
As for the scenes you shot in our city,

463
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:15,148
please remove them entirely
from the drama.

464
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,360
Deputy Mayor.

465
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,717
I understand that you have been
affected because of us,

466
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:21,158
but that's asking for too much.

467
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:25,142
You see, we're not Mr. Wook's
management company.

468
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:26,342
That's right.

469
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:28,328
We're just people making the drama,

470
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:30,864
and he's merely the male lead.

471
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:33,296
Your festival doesn't have
much to do with us.

472
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,640
Do you remember me?

473
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,910
On the first day, you came
to get my approval.

474
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,133
Yes, of course.

475
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:43,530
Please take a look at article two.

476
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,460
It's the filming approval.

477
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,550
Read it out loud.

478
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,107
"During the filming, if any actors
or any other factors..."

479
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:55,318
"cause harm to the reputation
and image of the city,"

480
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,732
"all cooperation must be suspended,"

481
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:04,103
"and scenes featuring the city
in the filmed content..."

482
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:07,003
"must be deleted upon request."

483
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,298
Wait.

484
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:15,962
Please hear me out.

485
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,882
I'm sorry the festival didn't meet
your expectations,

486
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,354
but you can't solely blame our actor.

487
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:23,371
Do you even know what happened that day?

488
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:25,491
Yes, I was there at the festival.

489
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:27,075
Then you'd know it well.

490
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:30,020
The tourists left disappointed that
Mr. Wook didn't come.

491
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,899
Yes, but it was also pouring rain,

492
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:34,721
so the festival ended early
and many had to leave.

493
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:36,275
Mr. Wook also had something urgent...

494
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,302
Stop.

495
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,355
You won't get your point across.

496
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:42,914
What really matters in life?

497
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,196
I know it's a profound question,

498
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:47,851
but Woori City comes before
my family and health...

499
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,422
because it's my first and foremost value.

500
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:53,700
But you disgraced, disrespected,
and damaged our city,

501
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,949
so you must pay the consequences.

502
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,659
My goodness.

503
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,521
You are such a hassle!

504
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,348
Just go! I won't do it. Good grief.

505
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,713
- Hello.
- Hello.

506
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,692
I have a question. At the festival...

507
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,846
Well...

508
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:25,051
- Hello.
- Hello.

509
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:27,315
- Let me give you a hand.
- No, just leave it.

510
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,697
What's the point of working hard?

511
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,875
- Get out of here.
- Don't ever come back.

512
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,628
Go away!

513
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:37,685
Get lost!

514
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:42,755
The farms that made a profit
won't meet with us,

515
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:45,891
and we're being chased away
by the farms that struggled.

516
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,706
They even threw grapes at us.

517
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:51,376
For the past three months,
we worked tirelessly on the event.

518
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,892
How could they be so insulting
and drive us away?

519
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,883
Head back if you're that tired,
and leave the papers.

520
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,363
Are your eyes blurry with age?

521
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,954
These are regular glasses,
not magnifying ones.

522
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:07,245
But it means you can't see
the small print clearly.

523
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,643
The farms that made a lot of profit...

524
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:17,851
were set up in the A-zone
of Cheongsong Village.

525
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,833
Can't we go back now?

526
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,203
That hurt.

527
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:29,711
I'm so dizzy.

528
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:35,203
My eyes aren't old,
but I do have astigmatism.

529
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:36,203
Before we finish,

530
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:39,460
let's meet with one more farm.

531
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,818
Producer Gang, what's going on?

532
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:48,018
Many scenes were filmed in Woori City.

533
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:51,127
If we have to scrap and reshoot,
we won't make the deadline!

534
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:53,720
There simply isn't enough time to do it.

535
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,558
This is all because of Mr. Wook.

536
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:59,963
Producer Gang, you work
at the Planning Team now,

537
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:01,231
so don't worry about it.

538
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,797
The drama is almost over, anyway.

539
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,973
Just keep it going.

540
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:08,142
For the record, that's on you.

541
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,368
Producer Han, you can take the blame.

542
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,009
Look.

543
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,392
That little punk.

544
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,665
How can I brush it off?

545
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:17,647
When I was the chief producer
before getting demoted to a Planning Team,

546
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,999
it was to air the next day...

547
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,312
when I got that filming permission.

548
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:24,431
I even asked the Deputy Mayor
when we got rejected.

549
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:26,508
That's how I got it approved.

550
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,363
Yes, you did great.

551
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:30,363
By the way,

552
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:34,082
Director Shin, who came with
the Deputy Mayor,

553
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:36,401
didn't he attend your high school?

554
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,992
You should try to convince him.

555
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:40,579
He's too much of a government guy...

556
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,649
who doesn't mix work and personal matters.

557
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:44,596
For crying out loud!

558
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,817
We didn't even make a lot.

559
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:51,065
Why are you here investigating
to make us feel bad?

560
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:54,002
I know. We haven't sold everything.

561
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,697
There are many boxes left over.

562
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,610
Can I look at the boxes?

563
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,825
What's the point?

564
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:02,240
You were there when we picked
and packed the grapes.

565
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,489
Out of everything you checked that day,

566
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:06,116
we still have a bunch left.

567
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,249
Are you going to keep lying?

568
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:15,665
What are you talking about?

569
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:18,106
Why would I lie to you?

570
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:19,545
Who was it?

571
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:21,479
Who asked you to hatch this idea?

572
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:38,266
We sold the leftovers, thanks to you.

573
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:41,983
There's a bit of commotion now,

574
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:45,024
but our man will take the blame.

575
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,290
He's very responsible like that.

576
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:52,114
This is all karma biting him back
for what he did to me.

577
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,289
Darn it.

578
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,843
- Gi Cheol.
- Hello, Boss.

579
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:09,284
Where is Mr. Wook?

580
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:10,583
He is probably in his car.

581
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,629
My goodness. Smile.

582
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,629
Producer Gang.

583
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,269
What are you doing?

584
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:37,152
This isn't what I had in mind.

585
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,492
My goodness, it came out great.

586
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:42,506
(Woori City)

587
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:46,593
No way.

588
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,512
Mr. Wook gets on my nerves.

589
00:34:49,512 --> 00:34:50,610
What is it? Give it here.

590
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:57,947
Okay. Here you go, boss.

591
00:34:58,505 --> 00:34:59,819
What's this?

592
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,650
Some grapes from Woori City.

593
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,108
Come on.

594
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:06,115
I couldn't make it because
something came up.

595
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:07,115
Hold it.

596
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:09,565
Why should I? I don't want to.

597
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,791
Maybe I should send this photo
to all the reporters.

598
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,300
I quit social media.

599
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,484
Just one post gets all these
people go crazy,

600
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:18,662
and they tear me apart for it.

601
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:22,374
Look, she cast you in a drama
during your slump,

602
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:24,823
and made you a global star.
Don't you remember?

603
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,973
Hurry up.

604
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,935
If you do what I say,
I'll delete the photos.

605
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:37,630
- That's great.
- Nice shot.

606
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:39,899
All right.

607
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:41,578
You know how it's done.

608
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:43,683
What a global star.

609
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,498
Such a loyal guy!

610
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:50,116
Look at this.

611
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:53,482
He posted a picture of himself
eating our grapes.

612
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:55,171
Skipping the festival is causing issues,

613
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:58,659
so he's trying to play it off
with this picture.

614
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,054
Good grief, I hate that guy.

615
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,401
What are you doing here?

616
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:11,790
I specifically told you not
to do anything.

617
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,769
What makes you think you can
boss me around?

618
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:17,768
- I'll meet you inside.
- I'll meet you inside.

619
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,669
Why are you stirring up trouble?

620
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:26,525
I'm only fixing the issue.

621
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:28,452
Do you think posting that picture
will save your skin?

622
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,388
It's not about saving anyone,
but taking responsibility.

623
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:34,241
This is why I don't trust networks
and hate star endorsements.

624
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,615
Then how do you explain...

625
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:39,559
attracting new tourists thanks to
Mr. Wook's drama?

626
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,245
What about him not showing up...

627
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:43,238
and causing a great loss to the city?

628
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:45,359
That's why he posted online afterward,

629
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,549
trying to make up for the damages.

630
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:50,602
Just don't start up anything
to cause more harm.

631
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,246
Don't tell me what to do.

632
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:55,686
You can do your own thing.

633
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:57,419
I'll handle it my way.

634
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:03,998
The drama wraps up in two weeks

635
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:06,783
with only four episodes left.

636
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:10,032
It's a lot to ask, but we need
your support to the end.

637
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,406
The no-show incident of our male lead...

638
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:14,798
upset tourists, some of whom
had even flown in,

639
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:16,854
and they left feeling deceived,

640
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:19,109
even posting complaints on your site.

641
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:21,453
So I know the extent of the damage.

642
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:25,357
Speaking for everyone at the network,
I offer our sincere apology.

643
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:26,903
We apologize.

644
00:37:26,903 --> 00:37:29,488
Producer Gang Min Ju,

645
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,191
your apology is duly noted.

646
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:33,871
But this does not resolve
the issue at hand.

647
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:37,188
Woori City suffers too greatly
from this incident,

648
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:41,416
although we should have taken
some measures on-site.

649
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,833
What with the suspicions
of preferential treatment,

650
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:47,748
Chief Ko, who was at the site,
is entirely to blame.

651
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,483
Chief Ko.

652
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,105
Chief Ko, what's that?

653
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:58,442
Let me tell you why the A-zone
of Cheongsong Village...

654
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,242
stood out with their grapes sales.

655
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:03,741
Instead of locally produced grapes
that were strictly selected,

656
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,709
theirs were of a low quality
imported and sold at reduced prices.

657
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:10,865
How did that even happen?

658
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:14,073
Are you saying they switched the grapes?

659
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,265
That's right.

660
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:18,433
By exploiting the wholesalers
at the festival,

661
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,188
they made off with a quick profit.

662
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:26,553
My goodness, that's just ridiculous.

663
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,458
How can you even tell if those grapes...

664
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,062
are imported or locally grown?

665
00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:32,315
This box is enough evidence.

666
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:35,943
- Box?
- Box?

667
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:38,383
Yes, the grapes sold at the festival...

668
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,262
were packed in these boxes.

669
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:42,871
And to prevent any sneaky swaps...

670
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:46,359
with grapes from other regions
or of lesser quality,

671
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,446
I placed marks on our city logo.

672
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:51,434
Right here.

673
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:58,262
But there isn't any on these boxes.

674
00:38:58,262 --> 00:38:59,951
It's simply our city logo.

675
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,343
Do you mean they used boxes
with our logo to sell imported grapes...

676
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,717
That's right.

677
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,904
The farmers of A-zone worried there
wouldn't be enough profit...

678
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:11,104
and dropped their prices this way.

679
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,735
And they chose to look the other way.

680
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:15,134
How could this even happen?

681
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:19,007
First, people who were tricked into buying
cheap imported grapes...

682
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,965
will be sent our local grapes instead.

683
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:23,407
They will receive a written apology
from the farmers.

684
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,455
They are on board with it.

685
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:28,294
That's a relief.

686
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:30,541
You did well to figure this out.

687
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,474
And at the festival,

688
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:35,694
I know you worked harder than anyone.

689
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,031
Why are you looking at me?

690
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:43,085
- Chief Ko.
- What is it?

691
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:46,853
The local grape farms are getting
swarmed with orders.

692
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:48,915
They want us to come over right away...

693
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:50,947
for the grape selection process.

694
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,036
What are you talking about?

695
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:54,667
Mr. Wook posted the grapes online,

696
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:57,428
and now they're flooded with
orders from overseas.

697
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,428
What?

698
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:00,204
Take a look.

699
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:06,990
What? Producer Gang, did you do this?

700
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:09,554
We thought it might help...

701
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:12,172
with the grapes' sales in the city.

702
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,861
I'm glad there is a good response.

703
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,571
In that case, we'll have to
retract our dismissal...

704
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:22,182
and support your location filming.

705
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:23,210
Really?

706
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:25,543
Thank you.

707
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,761
How about you give us approval for...

708
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,784
two other places that were denied?

709
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:31,852
Sure, let's do that.

710
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:33,514
Thank you.

711
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,066
Producer Gang and Chief Ko,

712
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,073
I appreciate your excellent joint effort.

713
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,092
Applause.

714
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:02,981
(Min Ji Seon)

715
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,833
Look here.

716
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,713
Is something bothering you?

717
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:21,713
It's nothing.

718
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:23,849
What's this?

719
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,346
You had some good times.

720
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:32,331
There is always a reason
when a girl is clingy.

721
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:34,316
But she takes it too far.

722
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,461
I can't deal with her always.

723
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:38,747
She must see you as a mom.

724
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,088
That's because you cooked her
delicious treats in Canada.

725
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:43,160
Ji Seon wasn't like this then.

726
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,560
Her parents passed away while
going through a divorce,

727
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,345
so it must have been a shock.

728
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,379
Being too nice can backfire.

729
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:56,823
Well, you took good care of her
for the past year.

730
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:59,720
After rushing over for everything
and bringing her packed meals,

731
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,122
you're like her guardian.

732
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,195
- She's like an overgrown child.
- What's that?

733
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:09,470
Like being age seven in a grown body.

734
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,088
I see.

735
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:14,019
I'm mature beyond my age,
and my body is...

736
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,207
What's so funny?

737
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:19,390
Why are you laughing?

738
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:22,450
Why are you laughing?

739
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:33,968
What are you doing there?

740
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:38,321
This makes me want to give
gardening a shot.

741
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:40,407
Give gardening a shot?

742
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:44,701
Taking care of living plants
takes a lot of work.

743
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:46,493
What if you start out curious...

744
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,452
but pull the busy card and neglect it?

745
00:42:48,452 --> 00:42:50,149
Then they wither, rot, and die.

746
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:51,994
Do I look that heartless?

747
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,861
Well, I can't say you're not.

748
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:57,316
My word.

749
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:59,626
I'm capable of keeping a garden.

750
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,573
That's one of the reasons
why I moved here.

751
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:06,194
Well, if you give it the same
dedication as your work,

752
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:07,762
you won't be a plant killer.

753
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:09,306
If you're that worried,

754
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,842
how about you lend me a hand?

755
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,130
Me? Why?

756
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,937
The work makes you really strict.

757
00:43:16,937 --> 00:43:20,690
You plan ahead and leave
no room for issues.

758
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,313
Of course, because it's my job.

759
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,640
Then be that way at work.

760
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,824
Why are you being so strict
and awful with me?

761
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:27,547
- Me?
- Yes.

762
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:30,960
That's how I stay in the clear.

763
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,466
Otherwise, you'd just cause
chaos left and right.

764
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:36,616
So what if there is some trouble?

765
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,880
That's what adds flavor to life.

766
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,808
You make that racket on your own.

767
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:42,911
I want to live in peace and quiet.

768
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:46,252
Fine. I'll be all hectic and loud!

769
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:53,583
You didn't even tell me you were coming!

770
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:54,688
Surprise.

771
00:43:54,688 --> 00:43:56,682
I brought your cooking neighbor.

772
00:43:56,682 --> 00:43:57,866
We met him out front.

773
00:43:57,866 --> 00:43:58,905
My goodness.

774
00:43:58,905 --> 00:43:59,978
Hi.

775
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:02,851
Come on in. We have all the ingredients,

776
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,978
but no one here knows how to cook.

777
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,170
I need her permission first.

778
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,944
Min Ju, is it a yes or no?

779
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:12,223
Sure, come on in.

780
00:44:12,223 --> 00:44:14,812
You paused like for two seconds.
Should I just leave?

781
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:17,497
- No.
- What? Get over here.

782
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:22,491
Tae Yeon, isn't this Min Ju?

783
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:23,729
Yes, it is.

784
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,176
It's unique and pretty.

785
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,214
Min Ju, who drew this?

786
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,817
That? My neighbor.

787
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:30,887
- Your neighbor?
- Your neighbor?

788
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:35,468
This is nice. Where did you get it?

789
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:37,590
My neighbor gave it to me.

790
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:39,338
Your neighbor?

791
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:41,361
Your neighbor?

792
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,839
I feel awful about this.

793
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,254
You're my guest, but I made you cook.

794
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:51,478
Don't worry. I enjoy making food.

795
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:53,687
My word, this is art itself.

796
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:54,970
I want to take pictures.

797
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:56,662
My goodness.

798
00:44:57,741 --> 00:44:59,835
- Such pretty food.
- Look here.

799
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:00,885
Cheese.

800
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,038
One more time.

801
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,630
Now with me.

802
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,632
- My word.
- Not like that.

803
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:10,875
- Jun Woo can take it.
- Long arms.

804
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,813
- One, two, three.
- Cheese.

805
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:16,837
So you fell for Min Ju on the first day?

806
00:45:16,837 --> 00:45:17,837
No.

807
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:19,637
What are you even asking?

808
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:22,214
Even before that.

809
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:26,568
Did you know each other before?

810
00:45:26,568 --> 00:45:28,809
We just met on the street.

811
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,124
- How did you meet?
- How?

812
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:34,219
I was out riding my motorbike.

813
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:36,554
Vroom!

814
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,771
Then Min Ju moved into this house.

815
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,933
Into my old place, as if it's fate.

816
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:48,098
- He said it's fate.
- Destiny.

817
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:49,913
There now, that's enough.

818
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,585
You're acting like giddy teens
hearing a first love story.

819
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,275
What's wrong with that?

820
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:57,289
I want to go back.

821
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:01,124
- Back to my glory days.
- Me, too.

822
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:03,203
Min Ju, you stay here with me.

823
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:04,887
Your glory days are right now.

824
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,695
That makes me cringe.

825
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:10,819
I'm so jealous.

826
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:14,500
What's all the racket this late?

827
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,519
My goodness.

828
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:19,793
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

829
00:46:23,478 --> 00:46:26,483
What? What's that?

830
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,424
Isn't that a skateboard?

831
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:30,514
Yes, it's a skateboard, all right.

832
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:32,888
- Min Ju, back in the day...
- That's right.

833
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,955
I never noticed it.

834
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:39,737
Who stashes a board here
like it's a pot stand?

835
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:41,758
Just leave it.

836
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,455
Ta-da.

837
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:45,857
- That's cool.
- That's cool.

838
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,558
Min Ju, did you ride a skateboard before?

839
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,869
No, I wanted to learn and bought it,

840
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:52,854
but there wasn't any time.

841
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:54,459
But I couldn't throw it away.

842
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:58,219
I'm pretty good at skateboarding.

843
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,621
I could teach you.

844
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:04,949
Is there anything you can't do?

845
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,192
Good question. Who knows?

846
00:47:09,555 --> 00:47:11,932
You're a good cook and a good drinker.

847
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:14,030
You can even skateboard.

848
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:18,720
Don't they know what time it is?

849
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,899
Good heavens.

850
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,771
I'll get going now. Have fun.

851
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:36,584
Are you leaving so soon?

852
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:38,423
Will you be here when we come again?

853
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,512
Of course.

854
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:41,864
Thank you for today.
And please be understanding.

855
00:47:41,864 --> 00:47:46,139
My friends are basically overgrown kids.

856
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,808
I'm not one to talk,

857
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:51,398
I had fun, thanks to you ladies.

858
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,944
How come Min Ju is Min Ju,
but we're just ladies?

859
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:57,655
I'm sorry, Tae Yeon.

860
00:47:58,829 --> 00:47:59,941
What about me?

861
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:01,494
Ae Gyeong.

862
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:03,370
Koo Tae Yeon, Shin Ae Gyeong.

863
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,290
What a great memory. You nailed it!

864
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,411
Have a good night.

865
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:08,545
- I'll take off.
- Okay.

866
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:10,752
- Have fun.
- Bye.

867
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,121
My goodness.

868
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:26,284
Jun Woo seems like a great catch.

869
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:30,027
Wait, why does he look familiar?

870
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:32,657
Here we go again with the nitpicking.

871
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:35,852
No, I honestly saw him somewhere before.

872
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,496
Anyway, he is really into you.

873
00:48:40,496 --> 00:48:42,004
That's all it matters.

874
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:43,603
I don't think so.

875
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:45,430
My feelings come first.

876
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:47,626
What about you?

877
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:50,848
Well, I'm not really sure yet.

878
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:54,337
My word, you've come a long way.

879
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:57,001
She used to have no interest in guys.

880
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,514
I get scared at times.

881
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:02,791
I come home, but there isn't
anyone to talk to.

882
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:08,511
Some days, I want to chat all night.

883
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,389
It would be great to talk things over,

884
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:14,877
gossip about celebrities on TV,

885
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:18,565
and laugh together about some show.

886
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:22,045
The thought of never having
someone like that...

887
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:24,023
makes me afraid.

888
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:26,556
That is just a dreadful thought!

889
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:30,227
Exactly. I get what you're saying!

890
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:31,607
You pathetic girls.

891
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,838
No, that's ticklish.

892
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:36,770
Stop it.

893
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Good grief.

894
00:49:40,098 --> 00:49:41,442
Hold on.

895
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:48,537
It's the next-door guy.

896
00:49:48,537 --> 00:49:50,515
Do you have another next-door guy?

897
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,269
What brings you here?

898
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,999
I won't stop you from being
loud by yourself,

899
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,447
but what about the rest of us
who want some peace and quiet?

900
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:07,404
You see now, I have friends over.

901
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,568
I'm sorry that we were noisy.

902
00:50:10,525 --> 00:50:11,525
Here.

903
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:13,478
What's this?

904
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,950
I should have given it to you.

905
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,264
You'd better read it now, at least.
Good night.

906
00:50:26,797 --> 00:50:29,370
- What is it?
- What do you have there?

907
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:32,014
"Rules for Forest Village Residents."

908
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,739
After 10 p.m.,

909
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:39,033
refrain from being loud and noisy.

910
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:43,104
That is a proper hangover cure.

911
00:50:43,104 --> 00:50:46,383
Second. Don't pick from other's gardens...

912
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,715
or damage their crops.

913
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:51,455
I got this from the garden.

914
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:52,860
For crying out loud.

915
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,104
Third. Your food waste

916
00:50:56,104 --> 00:50:58,654
can attract pests in the summer.

917
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:00,661
So make sure it's bound tightly...

918
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:02,992
and thrown out at designated spots.

919
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:06,615
Fourth. Avoid revealing clothes...

920
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:09,761
when you walk around the neighborhood.

921
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:18,717
Fifth. The above aren't optional,

922
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:22,579
but are rules that must be followed.

923
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,723
Good heavens.

924
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:25,588
I can't believe this guy.

925
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:28,181
I have a headache!

926
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:31,229
The two guys living next door...

927
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:32,752
are like night and day.

928
00:51:38,325 --> 00:51:40,524
My word, it's Ms. Producer.

929
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:42,188
- Hello.
- Are they your friends?

930
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:44,748
Say hi to my neighbor.

931
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,582
Then is she his sister?

932
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:49,999
Do you all work at
the broadcasting station?

933
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:51,774
You look like celebrities.

934
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:54,877
She is a famous sports dance instructor.

935
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,702
Did you say famous?

936
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:59,590
She is more famous as an essay tutor.

937
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,895
- For high and middle schools.
- Private lessons.

938
00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:04,670
I see. So you're an essay tutor.

939
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,154
That's good to know.

940
00:52:06,154 --> 00:52:08,343
My husband also teaches middle schoolers.

941
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:10,439
Is that right?

942
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:13,488
You all have great jobs. I'm jealous.

943
00:52:13,488 --> 00:52:14,488
Are you married, then?

944
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:17,274
We're heading to work. See you again.

945
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:19,419
Right. What's wrong with me?

946
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:21,514
I'm all over the place. Take care.

947
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,514
- Bye.
- Bye.

948
00:52:24,116 --> 00:52:26,102
You should visit again.

949
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,424
- Okay.
- Okay.

950
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:30,751
Heading to work?

951
00:52:31,742 --> 00:52:33,904
I want to do something like that.

952
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:40,294
Let's find the values of "x" and "y."

953
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,214
The equation is "x" plus "y"
equals "five."

954
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:45,814
Now subtract "2x" plus "y"
equals "8" from it.

955
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,262
Take this away.

956
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,696
What is "x" minus "2x"? It's "minus x."

957
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:51,504
That means "y" minus "y" equals "zero."

958
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:53,473
The minus before makes it the same.

959
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:54,665
It's like an offset.

960
00:52:54,665 --> 00:52:55,992
What's gotten into our PR teacher?

961
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:58,136
What a nerve with these math dropouts.

962
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,128
Is it true he's switching schools?

963
00:53:00,128 --> 00:53:01,129
Hallelujah.

964
00:53:01,129 --> 00:53:04,200
No, I've been hearing it since last year.
He might stick around.

965
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,784
I hope he disappears soon.

966
00:53:05,784 --> 00:53:07,177
Goodbye, captain.

967
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:08,467
Goodbye.

968
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,281
"Carpe diem."

969
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:34,064
It's Latin for "Seize the day."

970
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,577
Your life should be about...

971
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:39,644
laughing, having fun, and being happy.

972
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:42,230
Good grief.

973
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:53,588
Look, I believe in you guys.

974
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:56,355
Don't stress too much
about the grades for the finals.

975
00:53:56,355 --> 00:53:58,779
Studying isn't everything in life.

976
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:00,523
Sine, cosine, tangent.

977
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:02,292
There are other things more important.

978
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:05,629
Life values, passion, and happiness.

979
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,394
I hope you find all that.

980
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:18,394
That's it.

981
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:20,898
Attention.

982
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:23,047
- Bow.
- Thank you.

983
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:24,055
Have a good one.

984
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:28,749
What's with that guy?

985
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,751
Which do you think will win
the best drama?

986
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,478
"The Seven Flying Dragons."

987
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:36,822
What? I say it's "Yongpil."

988
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:37,888
How about we make a bet?

989
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:39,296
- For 50 dollars. Deal?
- Deal.

990
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:40,510
Okay.

991
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,887
It's going to be "Mr. Cop."

992
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,151
Hello, Boss.

993
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,479
Hello.

994
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,679
Do you want in on our bet?
It's 50 dollars.

995
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:48,190
Sounds good.

996
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,935
I'm telling you, it's "Mr. Cop."

997
00:54:50,935 --> 00:54:53,100
No way. It doesn't stand a chance.

998
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,204
That didn't even make
the best drama shortlist.

999
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:56,677
Are you serious?

1000
00:54:56,677 --> 00:55:00,293
The main leads even went down
in the sewer to perform.

1001
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:01,918
How could this even happen?

1002
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:03,876
But wasn't it a bit too cliche?

1003
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:06,980
Yes, despite the production funds
and an all-star cast,

1004
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,429
it was hard to relate to it.

1005
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:10,669
The drama was behind the times.

1006
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,948
Boss, you're not as good as they say.

1007
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:14,023
Stop it.

1008
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,927
You just don't get it.

1009
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:19,998
Excuse me, boss.

1010
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:21,387
You're in on our bet.

1011
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:22,698
Fifty dollars.

1012
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:23,788
Good grief.

1013
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:29,669
Gang Min Ju.

1014
00:55:30,353 --> 00:55:32,489
Why are you saying it won't work?

1015
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,090
The script is all over the place.

1016
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,685
The story won't hold up for 16 episodes,

1017
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:38,233
there isn't enough conflict,

1018
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:39,977
and the characters aren't realistic.

1019
00:55:39,977 --> 00:55:41,650
This is crazy.

1020
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,753
Producer Gang.

1021
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,417
Are you dissing the script because
it's from a writer who's a nobody?

1022
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,786
If you hadn't known who wrote it,

1023
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:48,812
would you still be talking that way?

1024
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:52,059
I'm not biased like that.

1025
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:55,900
Then why are you throwing shade
at my next production?

1026
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,638
It was a programming meeting,

1027
00:55:57,638 --> 00:56:00,911
and I gave my honest opinion
as a chief producer.

1028
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:04,050
I can't get this started because
you won't approve!

1029
00:56:04,503 --> 00:56:05,580
Good heavens.

1030
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,550
The same goes for Ms. Na's script.

1031
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,661
You could have it aired after
all that tweaking,

1032
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:17,119
and with ratings in the gutter,
it would do average.

1033
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,206
What if she takes it to another network
or cable TV?

1034
00:56:20,206 --> 00:56:22,117
It won't even pass for average.

1035
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:24,062
Then scrap it. Why hold onto it?

1036
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:25,899
You're wasting time and hurting feelings.

1037
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,568
The concept has potential,

1038
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:30,353
so I'm going to develop the story.

1039
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,299
But it's bound to flop otherwise.

1040
00:56:32,299 --> 00:56:33,865
How can you be that sure about it?

1041
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:37,566
I've been in this position for a reason.

1042
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:40,679
You never know until you try!

1043
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:42,326
- I've been right all this time.
- Look.

1044
00:56:42,326 --> 00:56:45,302
Excuse me. Please don't argue.

1045
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:48,233
Fine, let's take a vote then.

1046
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,001
- You saw what I pitched, right?
- Yes.

1047
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:53,359
Who thinks it's a good series?

1048
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,619
What's it about?

1049
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,634
No more?

1050
00:56:58,634 --> 00:56:59,979
Are you sure?

1051
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:06,606
My goodness.

1052
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:12,627
Do you see that? Seven out of ten
raised their hands.

1053
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:13,946
That would be eight, including me.

1054
00:57:13,946 --> 00:57:16,196
Ma. Na doesn't count
since she didn't see it.

1055
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:18,213
Are you still sure?

1056
00:57:19,612 --> 00:57:22,845
Still, it's a guaranteed flop
if you ask me.

1057
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:26,141
Darn it.

1058
00:57:31,554 --> 00:57:33,131
What's your problem?

1059
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:35,317
Can't you keep up with the times?

1060
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,364
Maybe I've lost my touch.

1061
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:41,391
What?

1062
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:45,071
I just don't find it interesting at all.

1063
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,173
What's with me?

1064
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,870
Come on, it happens.
No need to make a big deal.

1065
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,001
Forget it. I'm hanging up!

1066
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,671
Getting older,

1067
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,030
I've given up on many things.

1068
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:22,025
Always pushing what I wanted aside,

1069
00:58:22,025 --> 00:58:23,581
I have chosen work instead.

1070
00:58:31,027 --> 00:58:34,923
("Paradise for Youth")

1071
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:58,015
I'm capable of keeping a garden.

1072
00:58:58,015 --> 00:59:00,410
That's one of the reasons
why I moved here.

1073
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:14,576
If I can't excel at something
I've sacrificed for,

1074
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:17,482
then what remains in my life?

1075
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:22,472
No matter how old I get,

1076
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:25,891
I don't want to lose my touch
in this changing world.

1077
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:38,257
Min Ju, are you heading out to skateboard?

1078
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:39,937
No.

1079
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:43,527
After cluttering up my place,
I'm going to sell it.

1080
00:59:43,527 --> 00:59:45,430
- Sell your skateboard?
- That's it.

1081
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,990
That's why I'm heading out.

1082
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,859
- Come on, give it here.
- What?

1083
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,883
I'll teach you how to ride. Hop on.

1084
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:55,613
No, that's okay.

1085
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,480
If you don't do anything,

1086
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,464
nothing will happen.

1087
01:00:08,562 --> 01:00:10,034
Let's go.

1088
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:11,285
My goodness.

1089
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:20,668
Who is he? I just can't seem to place him.

1090
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,012
I remember now.

1091
01:00:28,386 --> 01:00:31,091
I don't want money,
but just for you to cook for me!

1092
01:00:31,091 --> 01:00:32,251
Not anymore.

1093
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,305
No, please don't do that.

1094
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:38,656
From now on, you're on your own.

1095
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,325
I know that guy. Good heavens!

1096
01:00:51,393 --> 01:00:54,162
Ae Gyeong, I remember who he is.

1097
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:57,164
Who do you think?
Jun Woo, Min Ju's neighbor.

1098
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,247
My word, Ms. Koo from the essay class!

1099
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:03,311
Right.

1100
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:05,120
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1101
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,418
I'm hanging up.

1102
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:08,599
Hello?

1103
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,425
Why would she hang up midsentence?

1104
01:01:10,973 --> 01:01:14,001
This is killing me. Who is he, anyway?

1105
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:19,655
Welcome.

1106
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:26,862
Excuse me. Here.

1107
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,362
(Aegyeong Sports Center,
CEO Shin Ae Gyeong)

1108
01:01:28,362 --> 01:01:30,234
Do you remember me?

1109
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:33,004
Of course. Are you here to work out?

1110
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,867
Try it out before you sell or use it.

1111
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,877
But I haven't used it once.

1112
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,412
I'll help you.

1113
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:51,472
Place your foot here.

1114
01:01:51,472 --> 01:01:52,804
Bend your knees.

1115
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:55,233
Dear me.

1116
01:01:57,176 --> 01:01:59,022
My word, I'm too scared.

1117
01:01:59,738 --> 01:02:01,378
And people are staring.

1118
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:04,656
Come on, don't let them bother you.

1119
01:02:04,656 --> 01:02:06,547
Who cares if they stare?

1120
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:08,773
It's all about you from now on.

1121
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:10,355
Forget that I'm here.

1122
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,443
And just imagine that nobody is around.

1123
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:14,197
Then slowly take your step.

1124
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:17,588
Let's try again.

1125
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:20,556
Push with one foot on the board.

1126
01:02:20,556 --> 01:02:22,110
One, two, three.

1127
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,164
There you go.

1128
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:29,354
Let's try again.

1129
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,600
Mind your lower back.

1130
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,813
Okay, let's push and keep going.

1131
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:37,019
All right. Take your time.

1132
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,143
My goodness!

1133
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,420
This pushes it backward.

1134
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,971
Like this?

1135
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:46,185
Do you mean it goes like this?

1136
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,608
Goodness.

1137
01:02:59,399 --> 01:03:00,473
I can't do it.

1138
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:07,895
This won't work.

1139
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:09,241
It's okay. Try again.

1140
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,889
You're doing it.

1141
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:55,815
(Second to Last Love)

1142
01:03:56,109 --> 01:03:57,588
Are they really dating?

1143
01:03:57,588 --> 01:03:59,294
Today is Day One.

1144
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:02,053
Don't you have any pride?
I can't stand you.

1145
01:04:02,053 --> 01:04:03,172
Do you like this guy?

1146
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,262
Does that make you happy?

1147
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:05,428
You're stuck in the past.

1148
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:07,262
If you keep on this way
putting yourself first,

1149
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:09,357
there won't be anyone left next to you,

1150
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:11,078
like there isn't anyone now.

1151
01:04:11,111 --> 01:04:13,111
