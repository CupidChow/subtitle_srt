1
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:08,483
Gang Min Ju.

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,143
Life for me...

3
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:14,179
has been a struggle.

4
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,132
Are you ready?

5
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:24,751
Let's do this, then.

6
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,539
See how it's done.

7
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,581
Although I will remain alone,

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,571
I'll still love myself...

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,973
enough to live well and be in good health.

10
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,866
I make that promise to you, Gang Min Ju.

11
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:52,919
Get ready.

12
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,762
Five, four, three, two, one.

13
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,085
- What?
- Boss!

14
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:41,687
Producer Gang!

15
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:45,637
My goodness!

16
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:46,670
Producer Gang!

17
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,498
Gang Min Ju, this is where it ends.

18
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,428
Why did I even worry about my old age?

19
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:57,549
Darn it!

20
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,622
What? Let me go.

21
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,048
Let me go!

22
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:33,093
Stop doing that, woman.

23
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:34,708
Let me go.

24
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:37,613
I know how to swim.

25
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,965
This woman is a lot of work.

26
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,258
Are you trying to die?

27
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,004
Boss! Please don't die!

28
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,897
Are you okay? Are you?

29
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:01,672
Open your eyes. Look here!

30
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:04,526
Boss, you can't die like this.

31
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:08,495
I should have jumped instead.
Please forgive me.

32
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,675
Boss!

33
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,570
- Boss.
- Get out of the way.

34
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,297
Darn it.

35
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,727
Look here, are you with me?

36
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:56,727
Boss.

37
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,728
Look here, are you with me?

38
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,262
Are you okay?

39
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:14,634
She's alive.

40
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,793
You there, bring a blanket.

41
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:32,736
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,631
I forgot to sort out the harness.

43
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,631
You forgot to do it?

44
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,955
Your negligence could have killed someone!

45
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,473
"There is an urgent need
for legislation..."

46
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,593
"surrounding the supervision of
bungee jumping facilities."

47
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,197
"Above all,"

48
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,750
"it is critical to raise awareness
and provide safety training..."

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,925
"to the overseeing public servants..."

50
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,669
"in order to prevent loss of life."

51
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,700
Every year, there are 140 accidents,

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,179
and these are the articles on them!

53
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:02,668
Doctors aren't the only ones
who save or take lives.

54
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,269
As the Environment Facilities Team,

55
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,807
our mismanagement of facilities
could get people killed!

56
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:13,842
We're the Regional Tourism Team
after the merge.

57
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:16,421
What's your point?

58
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,908
Should we should focus on getting tourists
and making revenue...

59
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,189
since such things
doesn't concern us anymore?

60
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:24,021
That we should disregard safety and ignore
people getting killed?

61
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,204
Is that what you're thinking?

62
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,502
No, sir.

63
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:36,281
Yes, this is the Regional Tourism Team.

64
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,861
What?

65
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,270
Who is in charge of the bungee jump?

66
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,375
How could you not even check it?

67
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:48,703
Who did you say?

68
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,612
Okay, I'll be right there.

69
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,723
Make sure he stays put!

70
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,235
Chief Ko Sang Sik?

71
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,685
This is driving me crazy.

72
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:26,811
Are you feeling okay?

73
00:06:28,393 --> 00:06:29,393
No.

74
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,202
I brought whatever we had in the wardrobe.

75
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,653
See if anything fits.

76
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:43,642
What about the shoot?

77
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:47,920
Did you stop filming?

78
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,979
Yes.

79
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,769
Then what?

80
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:53,760
The bungee jumping scene won't work,

81
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,111
so they decided to replace it.

82
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,058
Why didn't they do so before?

83
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:01,271
Be careful.

84
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,052
Here, I got you a back brace.

85
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,315
(Second to Last Love)

86
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,079
Yes, I apologize.

87
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,527
I'll take measures to ensure that
it never happens again.

88
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,531
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,962
Have Chief Ko report to my office.

90
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,780
Chief Ko.

91
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,896
My word, you should rest.

92
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,523
Forget it. Just stand over there.

93
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,106
- What is it?
- What is it?

94
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,983
How can you say that after
what happened to me?

95
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,557
Our actress could have been killed.

96
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,343
Are you even aware of that?

97
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:06,751
Your facilities weren't even
checked prior to filming.

98
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,144
Is that a reasonable situation?

99
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,537
Reasonable?

100
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,769
How dare you speak that way?

101
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,174
What?

102
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:19,671
This wouldn't have happened
if you had followed the rules.

103
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,631
To film in the bungee jump area,

104
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,040
you were required to submit
a proper request.

105
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,432
If you had taken this basic step,

106
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,795
you wouldn't have taken a plunge
or put your life at risk.

107
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:29,889
But since you're above that,

108
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,576
you proceeded into a place
under inspection...

109
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,496
and filmed regardless of everything.

110
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,321
That's what caused the accident.

111
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,176
I had already rejected your request,

112
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,771
but it's you who pulled the strings
to push it through.

113
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:44,774
Are you patting yourself on the back
for nearly killing someone?

114
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:48,763
It's the duty of public servants
to serve the people.

115
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,821
So with safety issues like this,

116
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,117
you should start by apologizing.

117
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,525
But you patronize me like
I'm not an adult.

118
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:56,525
Are you an adult?

119
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,613
How can you consider yourself one?

120
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,421
You cause more trouble than kids do
by always creating issues.

121
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,314
I won't be apologizing, so leave now.

122
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:06,757
What did you say?

123
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,485
You're always stirring up trouble...

124
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,672
and your mess keeps me
from getting work done.

125
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,460
I can't bear to talk
with the likes of you.

126
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,383
So don't show your face. Got it?

127
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,486
What a pain in the neck!

128
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:23,295
I'm the one who can't stand talking
with someone like you!

129
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,715
Do you think I can't give you
a piece of my mind?

130
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:28,835
Take it easy.

131
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,293
He saved you when you were drowning.

132
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:34,589
Who saved whom here?
I nearly died because of him.

133
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:44,262
Now what? We're supposed to
film here next week.

134
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:49,411
How can someone like that
work in government?

135
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:50,853
For goodness' sake.

136
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,620
Boss.

137
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,624
Regardless of any circumstance,
we're public servants.

138
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:01,963
Isn't that right?

139
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,474
Besides complying with regulations,

140
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,224
it's crucial to follow orders
that I've signed...

141
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,856
and bear the responsibility
that comes with it.

142
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:13,264
I wasn't informed about the filming
at the bungee jump site.

143
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,582
The entire place was approved.

144
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,978
You should have made sure.

145
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:21,865
It says here Mr. Cha oversees
the bungee jump site.

146
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,339
Is he your junior staff?

147
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,071
Yes.

148
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,688
How should we handle this?

149
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,621
There ought to be disciplinary action.

150
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,839
You are right about him being in charge,

151
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,947
but he shouldn't take the blame.

152
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:35,988
And why not?

153
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:38,389
He has carried out inspections
as outlined in the plan,

154
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,541
and it was my job to check
after the approval...

155
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,628
and give further instructions,
but I messed up.

156
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:44,781
So this falls on me...

157
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:47,360
and I should face the consequences.

158
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:53,925
Then you'll be stripped of the award...

159
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,460
for your recent heroic act.

160
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,558
Are you okay with that?

161
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,645
It doesn't matter.

162
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,197
All right.

163
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,957
Then for the rest of the filming,

164
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,871
I expect you to escort them personally.

165
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,326
What?

166
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,333
Drama?

167
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,519
Drama... For crying out loud.

168
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:41,141
My goodness, you can't be serious.
How can this happen?

169
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:42,998
- Doesn't it blow your mind?
- It sure does.

170
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,013
Having fun? It looks like you are.

171
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,176
Boss.

172
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,174
You're back from the dead.

173
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,503
It could have been goodbye forever.

174
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,793
Stop watching it.

175
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,576
My goodness.

176
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,341
Look at that handsome guy.

177
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:01,105
Get your eyes checked.

178
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:04,463
What a lifesaver, whoever he is.

179
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:06,250
- Can't we zoom in closer?
- Sure.

180
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,460
That's enough.

181
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,911
It turns out that our fearless queen...

182
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:14,093
trusted someone with her wet body.

183
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,430
Completely.

184
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,471
My word, she sure did.

185
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,050
I've had enough already.

186
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,013
Sorry.

187
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,574
Why did you even bother going
to make a scene?

188
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,623
I needed approval for the filming,

189
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:34,375
and I wanted to know what
it's like living there.

190
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,223
Are you thinking about farming?

191
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,335
It'd be nice since I'll be alone.

192
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:41,263
It seems you're determined to stay single.

193
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:43,559
I told you not to be picky.

194
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,668
If I had time for that,
why would I bother moving?

195
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,630
You speak as if you're retiring.

196
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,408
Are you looking for a nursing home?

197
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,906
Is that really on your mind?

198
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:01,535
Dear me, how attractive she is.

199
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,788
Hello.

200
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,325
Why would you personally visit
when you can send emails?

201
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:14,373
I wanted to deliver it in person.

202
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,485
It's my debut screenplay.

203
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:20,256
I'll have to see about that
after giving it a read.

204
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:23,949
Everything you nitpicked on last time...

205
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,991
got revised in the script.

206
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:32,680
Just have me read it.

207
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,080
- You're too tired.
- Nope.

208
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,794
I'll read it thoroughly at home.

209
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:39,125
That's not really necessary.

210
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,257
Good day.

211
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,754
You're such a workaholic.

212
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,281
Take care of yourself.

213
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,269
And stay away from nursing homes.

214
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:54,978
Nursing homes?

215
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,945
(Past Lover, Current Love)

216
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,246
I thought you were toast,
but you're kicking it.

217
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:11,809
Thanks for your well-wishing
after my close shave.

218
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,102
That scared me.

219
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:16,106
Do you think you're a cop or something?

220
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,255
Just mind your own business
and don't butt in.

221
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,367
I'll have to dig your grave
if you don't shape up.

222
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:21,952
Yes, go ahead.

223
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,994
Let's see who lies in it first.

224
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:31,825
- Here.
- What is it now?

225
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,377
No, I'd hurl if I get
another civil complaint.

226
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:35,757
Get hitched before you do.

227
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,856
She was once a nurse at a hospital.

228
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:42,635
The girl is young and pretty.

229
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,252
No thanks. Just pour me a beer.

230
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,794
You don't have any issues
with that, do you?

231
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm not that old to receive care.

232
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,634
Cut me some slack when I keep you company.

233
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Dear me.

234
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,548
Yes, I killed her.

235
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,497
("It's Never You" by Na Ae Ri)

236
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,502
"If you're curious about how
your life is going,"

237
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,489
"take a pause and ask yourself."

238
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,910
"It shouldn't be about achieving dreams,"

239
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,878
"but about whether you're happy now."

240
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,558
Yes, I just arrived.

241
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,606
I should meet you further inside?

242
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,621
Okay.

243
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,441
You can't dream of such a place in Seoul.

244
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,269
There is great air and a view
for a great price.

245
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,522
It's quiet and nice here.

246
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:54,835
The hospital and police station
are also nearby.

247
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,618
You know what to look for.

248
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,317
How many are in your family?

249
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,333
I'm planning to live alone.

250
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,924
I could tell you were someone classy.

251
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,891
Are you a successful single lady?

252
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,388
That's right.

253
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,124
Make sure you give me a call.

254
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,735
I have some business to take care of.

255
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:21,998
Is this a house or a cafe?

256
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:29,951
We meet again.

257
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
It's you.

258
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,046
Hop on.

259
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:41,335
Are you sure you won't ride?
You'll regret it.

260
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,647
You'd fall off that way.

261
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,172
It's quince tea.

262
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:59,119
You look like you have a cold
and seem tired.

263
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,636
Thank you.

264
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,165
It's pretty hot.

265
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:08,070
By the way, thanks for the other day.

266
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,813
Here is the menu if you're here to eat.

267
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,349
No, I was visiting the next door.

268
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:17,180
- Are you house-hunting?
- Yes.

269
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,919
That place is quite nice.

270
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,796
I know, right? I absolutely love it.

271
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:25,021
Then move here. We can be neighbors.

272
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:27,505
Do you live around here?

273
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,421
This is my place.

274
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,218
You must be the cafe owner.

275
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:33,598
Now I might have you as my regular.

276
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,042
That's good to know.

277
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,042
What is?

278
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:42,620
You seem like a wonderful neighbor.

279
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,036
I could rely on you when
something happens.

280
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,612
What might happen?

281
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:51,261
Like when I need an ambulance.

282
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,250
When you're my age...

283
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:57,415
Never mind.

284
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,736
But you look young.

285
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:01,736
Come on.

286
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm not kidding.

287
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,730
Fine, I'll be your regular here.

288
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,233
Excuse me.

289
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,099
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

290
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,297
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

291
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,023
Since there is work tomorrow,

292
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,095
you should head home now.

293
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:30,865
He is a square again.

294
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,327
What?

295
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,527
I told you we shouldn't have come here.

296
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,321
We can't even have drinks together.

297
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,647
Who suggested it, anyway?

298
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,583
This is my hangout, so stay clear.

299
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,719
Okay, you got it!

300
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,542
There won't be a second time.

301
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,955
Let's leave now.

302
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,597
Why are you kicking them out?

303
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:54,796
Having young people around
creates a nice vibe.

304
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:55,995
They called me a square.

305
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,980
Stop lecturing them because
it proves you're old.

306
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,151
Just change the music. It's too loud.

307
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:02,703
My goodness.

308
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,246
It's this Saturday.

309
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,246
What is?

310
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,823
The girl I mentioned for your blind date.

311
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:14,061
Come on. I turned it down.

312
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:15,786
I'm doing quite well.

313
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,947
My word, you have a blind date?

314
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,793
Look what you've done.

315
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,470
For crying out, Chief Ko!

316
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,470
Sorry.

317
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,862
Do you see?

318
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:36,217
Even my employees cringe at me.

319
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:40,041
It's because you carry around
that weird magazine.

320
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:42,124
What magazine?

321
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:47,306
Do you see?

322
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:51,435
I can't stand men.

323
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:55,396
I can't stand women.

324
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,157
What? Mr. Cha.

325
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:04,213
I thought you weren't coming tonight.

326
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,135
Everyone has already left.

327
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:07,135
Where is the Chief Ko?

328
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,611
Why are you here?

329
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,581
Why defend me to the Deputy Mayor?

330
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,323
They even revoked your award
because of what I did.

331
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:26,866
It's what ensured your fast-track
promotion and raise.

332
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:29,343
Stop causing trouble if you know that.

333
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:31,418
Let me take responsibility.

334
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:35,470
Take responsibility? How can you do that?

335
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,900
I'll take any disciplinary action.

336
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,730
What you can do for me is to work harder.

337
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,730
Chief Ko.

338
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,778
You're dead if you screw up again.

339
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,123
Is it because of your past?

340
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:49,639
I've heard rumors about it.

341
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:51,440
You always shoulder the burden...

342
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,387
and try to take the blame for
everything because...

343
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:57,923
Don't say what you don't know.

344
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,858
It's your slacking off and fussing...

345
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:01,493
that caused what happened.

346
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:03,255
Shut your mouth and watch yourself.

347
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,104
You can sit here.

348
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,834
You were doing something else
before applying here.

349
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,368
And you had a different major.

350
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,305
Have you abandoned your dream?

351
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:37,935
My dream?

352
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,409
My family is my dream.

353
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:47,892
Hurry! Run out!

354
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,276
Don't let go!

355
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,297
Hello.

356
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,539
How much is this? I see.

357
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,309
Maybe next time.

358
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,204
That rascal.

359
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,205
You there!

360
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:45,346
What?

361
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:49,307
Carry this when I'm asking nicely.

362
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,539
I can't because my hands are golden.

363
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,061
- Golden hands?
- Yes.

364
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:55,906
The golden fingers will rule the world.

365
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:57,341
Golden fingers?

366
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:59,392
Just don't butter up your fingers.

367
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,735
Your dad jokes stink.

368
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:03,543
Old man, I'll help you.

369
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,071
Fine, I'm an old man.

370
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:06,562
What have you been up to?

371
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,776
You've been out for days.

372
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:09,943
I've been working.

373
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,695
Seriously? What about the coffee shop?

374
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:13,964
I got fired.

375
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:14,964
Look here, Ko Mi Rye.

376
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,861
I shoot guns these days.

377
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:19,092
Guns?

378
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,223
Working at the gas station.

379
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:25,847
Fine, keep shooting the nozzles.

380
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,389
They told me not to come back.

381
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,861
What did you do now?

382
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,526
I pumped gasoline into a diesel tank.

383
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:32,736
You rascal.

384
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,686
You are a disgrace to this family.

385
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,349
It's because you're always
glued to your phone.

386
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:43,134
Sang Sik, I'm all grown up now.

387
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:44,860
Are you going to keep nagging me?

388
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,651
If you're an adult, stop dithering about,

389
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,141
and get a real job.

390
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,891
Job? Steve Jobs?

391
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:51,100
Apple?

392
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,283
Maybe I should change phones.

393
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,666
For crying out loud.

394
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,421
You can't even pay your phone bill.

395
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,484
What about Ye Ji? Is she not home yet?

396
00:24:58,484 --> 00:24:59,514
No.

397
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:03,439
Sang Hee seems to be busy
visiting Hun's teacher.

398
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,172
- You're my only concern.
- Okay.

399
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,757
Wait, I can't live without my phone!

400
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:12,012
You geezer!

401
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,767
- Did you just call me a geezer?
- Stop!

402
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:16,739
Stop right there!

403
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:25,657
You can move these over here.

404
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,225
And this goes inside.

405
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,843
Please mind the wooden floor.

406
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,056
Hello, Ae Gyeong.

407
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,845
Where are you hiding lately?

408
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,581
I moved today.

409
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:39,583
Seriously?

410
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,637
The city girl finally left Seoul?

411
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:44,614
That's right.

412
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,864
This is great. It's like a dream.

413
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:51,759
Missy, you should have told us.

414
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,528
You don't have a man around.

415
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:55,558
I can manage on my own.

416
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,079
Being too independent is your problem.

417
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,593
Any interesting neighbors?

418
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,125
There is an incredibly good-looking guy,

419
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,666
and he's super nice.

420
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,225
There is a guy?

421
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:09,787
Are you sure he's not married with kids?

422
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:11,441
Don't worry.

423
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:14,193
If you come here, you'll realize
how life was too hectic...

424
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,066
with your whole body.

425
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,632
There is such fresh air.

426
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,025
It'd be perfect with a husband.

427
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,544
Nonsense.

428
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,777
I'm going to eat great food here...

429
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:28,855
and enjoy walks and exercise...

430
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,604
to grow old with style.

431
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:28,311
Are you okay?

432
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:34,135
What are you doing here?

433
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,262
I brought you a gift.

434
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:41,549
My word.

435
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,421
My goodness.

436
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,145
Dear me!

437
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,952
What's this supposed to be?

438
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,347
Rice.

439
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,112
It's healthy mixed grain.

440
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:10,763
My digestion is acting up.

441
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:15,605
Why don't you eat at my place?

442
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,608
Sang Sik, I made you lunch.

443
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:29,058
It's okay. There isn't time.

444
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,569
Come on.

445
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,313
Why are you getting changed
to leave again?

446
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,010
I have to escort a filming crew
in the afternoon.

447
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,093
They expect me to look after
their drama shoot.

448
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,178
For a drama?

449
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,288
This is all because of the merge.

450
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:46,004
Why would they make a chief do that?

451
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:48,791
Some stuff went down.

452
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,567
All because of a crazy woman.

453
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,873
What are you talking about?

454
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,009
This looks good.

455
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,358
Have some before you go.

456
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,339
Yummy, it's good. I'm off.

457
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,346
Is anyone there?

458
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,283
- You must have a customer.
- Okay.

459
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:06,296
You came. Please come in.

460
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:07,983
This must be your house.

461
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:09,978
- It's connected to your cafe.
- That's right.

462
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:11,402
Welcome, new neighbor.

463
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,547
Thank you.

464
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:16,966
My goodness.

465
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:21,116
Your breakfast looks like art.

466
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:25,695
It's delicious.

467
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:28,271
What a healthy meal.

468
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:29,591
I can have some, right?

469
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:30,895
You already did.

470
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:33,357
You're always welcome to eat here.

471
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:34,533
I'll take up on that.

472
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,487
You must be a wonderful cook.

473
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,059
How did you make this?

474
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:43,771
(Relax with vegan dessert cooking)

475
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,357
Please come if you're interested.

476
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:48,402
I know you will need it.

477
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:50,840
Do you hold cooking classes at the cafe?

478
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,076
There is a free lesson once a week.

479
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:55,628
It's for those unsure about cooking...

480
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:57,766
or new to it, with healthy meal plans.

481
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,702
Then it's for someone like me.

482
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:03,335
How is your place?

483
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,665
Whoever lived there before
maintained it well...

484
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,170
and decorated it nicely.

485
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,841
It must have been a pity to move out,

486
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:13,097
although some places need fixing.

487
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:16,225
The kitchen's first cabinet door
wouldn't close well.

488
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:19,001
The wooden floor would creak
when you walk.

489
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:22,596
And the bed slants to one side
when it's by the window,

490
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:24,460
so you should get it supported.

491
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,580
I used to live there.

492
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:33,730
Really? Why did you move out?

493
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,609
It's just comfier to stay here.

494
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,909
The family here is nice, and we're close.

495
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,172
I see.

496
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,385
If you need any help, feel free to ask.

497
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:46,379
Now we're neighbors.

498
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,067
Yes, neighbor.

499
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,465
I'm Jun Woo. Park Jun Woo.

500
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:58,286
Jun Woo.

501
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:01,679
- I'm Gang Min Ju.
- Gang Min Ju.

502
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,456
No damages, keep to the schedule,
and safety comes first.

503
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:08,176
Please keep that in mind.

504
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,742
Yes, all right.

505
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,243
This place would look amazing
once it's completed.

506
00:32:14,243 --> 00:32:15,851
What a cave theater.

507
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,660
Horror films in the summer
would be delightful.

508
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,370
What's all that?

509
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,850
They're props.

510
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,082
In the drama, people make
wishes in this cave,

511
00:32:25,082 --> 00:32:26,801
so couples leave sticky notes there.

512
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,009
I don't care, but make sure
it gets cleaned up.

513
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:31,329
All right.

514
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,891
You don't have to worry.

515
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:34,613
How can I not worry?

516
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,147
You're here filming in a place
that's not even finished.

517
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:40,514
So keep to your schedule.
You have until 6 p.m. sharp.

518
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,984
Okay, you said that already.

519
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:45,179
Hurry, we don't have time.

520
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

521
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,258
I hope nothing collapses
or falls apart here.

522
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,586
So you still can't move on from that
bungee jump incident?

523
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:55,326
Of course not. My boss almost got killed.

524
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,302
The mayor is here.

525
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:00,814
Here you are.

526
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:05,453
Mayor, this is Ko Sang Sik.

527
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,635
It's good to meet you.

528
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:09,613
I've heard about your great work.

529
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,253
No, you're too kind.

530
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,470
Don't be modest.

531
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,582
This used to be an abandoned quarry,

532
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:16,893
but now it's become a cave theater.

533
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:18,491
I know that it was your idea.

534
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,796
Yes, we're still working on it...

535
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,391
Chief Ko has elevated our great city...

536
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,705
as an exemplary civil servant.

537
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,362
- This way.
- Okay.

538
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,733
You see, I'm such a fan of this drama,

539
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,613
so I did some nagging to come here.

540
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:37,782
Right, I'm glad you came.

541
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,951
- You should have a word with me.
- What?

542
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,856
- Hello.
- Hello.

543
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,052
Thanks for everything.

544
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:50,835
I would lose face if you refuse.

545
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:52,861
It's really okay.

546
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:54,419
Please take it back.

547
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,596
No, I won't.

548
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:58,164
This will get me in trouble.
Please take it back.

549
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,732
What does that make me?

550
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,586
Wait? What is he doing?

551
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:17,063
My goodness, seriously.

552
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:23,154
Here you are.

553
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:24,344
You should greet someone.

554
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:26,634
That man is the mayor.

555
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,110
And who is the woman next to him?

556
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,217
The mayor's wife.

557
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,919
Why do you ask that?

558
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,047
Never mind.

559
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:40,962
Hello.

560
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,771
This is Producer Gang Min Ju.

561
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,418
- Hello.
- Hello.

562
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

563
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,984
What is that woman doing here?

564
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,868
I love your new drama.

565
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:55,355
Yes, thank you.

566
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:59,341
When will your male lead arrive?

567
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:00,408
Why would you ask that?

568
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:04,172
I can relate since I'm also a fan.

569
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:07,351
I'll have you meet him later,
and get his autograph.

570
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:11,975
If you can, I won't have any more wishes.

571
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,156
Why don't you escort them?

572
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,131
Let me take you around. This way.

573
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:18,254
All right.

574
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:24,285
I'll get on my way.

575
00:35:24,285 --> 00:35:27,622
Why don't you watch the filming
since the mayor is here?

576
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,583
No, that's okay.

577
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:34,984
Goodbye.

578
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,399
He harped about keeping to the schedule.

579
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,196
Why is it so packed?

580
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:52,179
What's all this?

581
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,314
The mayor's wife brought treats
for the actors to enjoy.

582
00:35:56,314 --> 00:35:59,195
I can't believe all the work
they're giving us.

583
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:04,072
Chief Ko, take one.

584
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,957
- No, thanks.
- Come on.

585
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:09,762
My word.

586
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,667
Is there something to wipe with?

587
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,443
My goodness.

588
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:14,520
Dear me.

589
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,334
Let's do this.

590
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,965
Chief Ko.

591
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,894
Don't start that again. Stay still.

592
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:22,761
I'm okay. Leave it.

593
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,497
Please don't do that.

594
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,142
Stop all the fuss. There's more here.

595
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,480
Just stay still.

596
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:34,621
What are you doing?

597
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:38,998
Are you okay?

598
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:41,319
Yes, I'm all right.

599
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:43,096
Are you sure about that?

600
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:45,834
It's okay to tell me. I'll help.

601
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,328
What are you trying to say?

602
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:53,027
Negligence of duty, bribery,
and misconduct.

603
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,719
- What?
- In the disciplinary measures,

604
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,119
such criteria is considered
for civil servants.

605
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,147
So what?

606
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:02,111
You're a bad apple in the government.

607
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:03,288
What did you say?

608
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,960
I think you misunderstood.

609
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,593
It's okay, Ms. Han. My word.

610
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,775
You see, I'm not a public servant.

611
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:15,909
So why should we stop working
at 6 p.m. sharp?

612
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:19,004
We need more time to film,
so I'll reschedule.

613
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,207
That's not up to you.

614
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:22,813
What if someone gets hurt again?

615
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:25,417
- Then who will be responsible?
- I'll handle it.

616
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,937
If you could just cooperate.

617
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:29,552
Absolutely, please go ahead.

618
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:33,118
I'd rather not waste my precious breath...

619
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,768
on someone off their rocker like you.

620
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,387
Not one little bit.

621
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:39,983
What?

622
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:42,827
I gave you a timeline, so keep it.

623
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:47,619
My word, for crying out loud.

624
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:55,390
Cut! Okay.

625
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,612
That was great.

626
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:00,806
Next scene. Get a move on.

627
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:02,370
- Thanks for everything.
- Thank you.

628
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,274
- Have a good day.
- Goodbye.

629
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:06,082
- Thank you.
- Bye.

630
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:07,163
Look, Ms. Han.

631
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:08,931
I'll call you when we're done.

632
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:10,193
It'll soon be 6 p.m.

633
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:12,219
- How many scenes are left?
- Just one more.

634
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,528
Let's hurry up. Are you done over there?

635
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,547
Yes.

636
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,017
Ms. Han, filming wraps up at 6 p.m.

637
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:24,466
So make sure you check on
the phone with Mr. Cha,

638
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:25,912
and see that they finish on time.

639
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:27,778
- Okay, I will.
- Good.

640
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,750
That woman from earlier.

641
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:35,591
Why was she disrespectful to you?

642
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,502
Maybe she thinks I'm a joke.

643
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:42,576
(Your blind date)

644
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:45,225
Why did he put this in here?

645
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:56,401
After the merge, we're out working
and buried in more work.

646
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,203
You even have to deal with
this filming business.

647
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:03,264
The head of the Regional Tourism Team
was promoted,

648
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:06,089
but you're being overlooked like this.

649
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,183
More water? I'll get you some.

650
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:09,692
That's okay.

651
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:18,609
(Your blind date)

652
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:23,671
Cut! Okay.

653
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:24,837
That looked real.

654
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,877
- Good work, everybody.
- Great job.

655
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,196
Everyone did great.

656
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:34,611
Did she leave already?

657
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:38,068
Great work today.

658
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,262
Yes, all right.

659
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,379
They finished filming and left.

660
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,118
Is that right? Okay.

661
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:53,733
Yes, they wrapped it up.

662
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,133
Why didn't they clean this up?

663
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:04,965
For goodness' sake.

664
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,776
My word. Excuse me!

665
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,964
(Restricted Area)

666
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,097
Excuse me!

667
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:02,686
Excuse me!

668
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:06,620
There is a person here!

669
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:11,068
Anyone?

670
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,672
What now? Darn it.

671
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:20,586
What? Where are you?

672
00:41:21,118 --> 00:41:22,284
Boss.

673
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:23,959
Hello?

674
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:26,600
Turn the bus around now.

675
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:27,959
Gi Cheol!

676
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,231
Hello?

677
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:34,732
What?

678
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,839
Someone is stuck in the cave?

679
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:44,680
Excuse me!

680
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:49,246
Is anyone there?

681
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:54,878
Anyone?

682
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:03,936
Somebody help me.

683
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,584
Please!

684
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,120
What? You all went home?

685
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:18,381
Chief Ko, here is the key.

686
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:19,493
What's going on?

687
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,724
You should have double-checked!

688
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:24,974
Someone was still in the cave
when they closed it.

689
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:28,206
But everyone got out. Who is in there?

690
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,533
It's the woman in charge of the drama.

691
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:31,886
That can't be. I'll get her.

692
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:33,028
- Forget it.
- Chief Ko.

693
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,158
Chief Ko!

694
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:37,639
I can't believe this.

695
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,562
You should have made sure!

696
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:56,459
(Speed camera)

697
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:20,904
Over here!

698
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,676
Over here!

699
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:30,500
Over here! I'm locked in!

700
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,027
Over here!

701
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:38,840
Are you okay?

702
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
My goodness.

703
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,841
You're such a handful.

704
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:00,825
How can you not check to see...

705
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:03,074
and have me locked up like this?

706
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:04,890
The temperature drops when
the sun goes down,

707
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,444
which could lead to hypothermia.

708
00:44:08,722 --> 00:44:10,994
Save it. My crew will be here soon.

709
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:12,604
Why are you acting up again?

710
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,514
You never said it would be locked.

711
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:17,043
If you had kept to the schedule...

712
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,843
It was only ten minutes.

713
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:20,555
It was ten whole minutes.

714
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:23,019
You're such a stickler.

715
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:26,241
Weren't you taught to say
sorry or thank you?

716
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,331
Fine, thanks a bunch.

717
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,479
Seriously.

718
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,377
What were you even doing, anyway?

719
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:37,983
- Producer Gang!
- Boss!

720
00:44:37,983 --> 00:44:38,983
Producer Gang.

721
00:44:40,005 --> 00:44:41,541
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

722
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:46,112
I'm sorry. We should have tidied up.

723
00:44:46,112 --> 00:44:48,282
With the packed schedule,

724
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:49,777
we couldn't get it all done.

725
00:44:49,777 --> 00:44:52,337
Is this how you people work?

726
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:55,624
I make it clear that you can't
leave a mess behind.

727
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:58,022
There won't be any filming here
if you continue like this.

728
00:44:58,022 --> 00:44:59,199
- I apologize.
- I apologize.

729
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,699
She could have been stranded
until morning.

730
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,526
That's enough. I should have left sooner.

731
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:09,825
Give it here. I'll throw it away.

732
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:11,529
I'll take that.

733
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:13,813
Since I'm paid with your taxes,
I'll dispose of it.

734
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:16,683
I'm sorry again.

735
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:19,096
Good night.

736
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:21,290
He's uptight about everything.

737
00:45:26,695 --> 00:45:30,386
Did she really clean all this?

738
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:32,243
My word.

739
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:37,733
Paper in the paper section.

740
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,601
The plastic bag goes here.

741
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,662
I can't believe this.

742
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:53,628
This feels nice.

743
00:46:12,242 --> 00:46:13,966
What am I even thinking?

744
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:19,046
He's the bad apple who bribes
and harasses others.

745
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:36,210
The wooden floor would creak
when you walk.

746
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:41,490
The kitchen's first cabinet door
wouldn't close well.

747
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:46,415
And the bed slants to one side...

748
00:46:46,415 --> 00:46:49,361
when it's by the window,
so you should get it supported.

749
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,562
Dear me.

750
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,270
Hello, Mom.

751
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,885
I heard you moved.

752
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:19,789
Did you get home now after work?

753
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,370
What about dinner?

754
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,043
I told you not to worry.

755
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,835
It's all good. What about Dad?

756
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:30,572
Thanks to you, we're doing well here.

757
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:32,421
I know you love your work,

758
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:34,670
but are you going to live
there alone forever?

759
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,670
Yes.

760
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:39,949
Mom, are you still that excited
to have Dad around?

761
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:42,166
I find you two always arguing.

762
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,982
Even if you don't get hitched,

763
00:47:43,982 --> 00:47:46,839
you should have a man for yourself.

764
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,132
No, thank you.

765
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:53,732
I'm doing well on my own,

766
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:55,500
so look after yourself.

767
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,496
Hang up if you're going to nag.

768
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,607
All right.

769
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:02,710
Okay.

770
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:10,599
For crying out loud.

771
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:37,320
What's this sound?

772
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:51,423
I don't think it's Jun Woo.

773
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:55,014
Who is that?

774
00:48:56,588 --> 00:48:57,717
Good grief!

775
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:00,457
What are you doing here?

776
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:02,044
Jun Woo.

777
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:04,568
There is a ghost... a burglar here.

778
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:07,224
That's our new neighbor, not a ghost.

779
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:08,644
Did someone move here?

780
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:10,757
Who? Why didn't you tell me?

781
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:13,115
I was going to just now.

782
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:15,309
Get back in. You can say hi tomorrow.

783
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:17,284
Okay. Did you finish up at the cafe?

784
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:19,791
Yes, then I saw you over here.

785
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,562
Okay, let's go in.

786
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:36,436
Now that's better.

787
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:46,243
Good morning.

788
00:49:46,243 --> 00:49:47,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

789
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,795
I'm sure your place is great.

790
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:52,434
As long as you're not stuck in a cave.

791
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:55,659
But doesn't it take long to commute?

792
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,011
That's why I love it.

793
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:59,173
If nearby, I'd be here night and day...

794
00:49:59,173 --> 00:50:00,715
and get stressed out.

795
00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:03,539
What's this?

796
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:07,128
- What is it?
- Did you read the article?

797
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:08,328
(SBC's "You Can't Make Me Love"
faces plagiarism suit)

798
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:09,549
(Writer makes a suicide protest)

799
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,809
I told you to meet with her
as soon as possible.

800
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,823
Why does she have to handle
every issue at hand?

801
00:50:14,823 --> 00:50:17,328
That was our deal with the division head.

802
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:19,454
I've done my fair share.

803
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:23,692
Boss.

804
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:28,942
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

805
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,524
To bring this webtoon series to life,

806
00:50:31,524 --> 00:50:33,357
I dedicated three whole years,

807
00:50:33,357 --> 00:50:36,877
tirelessly working and pouring over it.

808
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:38,693
Though it was lonely and tough,

809
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:41,606
knowing that there are eager
readers out there,

810
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:44,342
I put my heart and soul into the work.

811
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,876
But without consulting me as the author,

812
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:49,742
SBC plagiarized my content...

813
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:52,637
and is shamelessly airing the drama,

814
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:56,871
without showing a hint of apology
or acknowledgment!

815
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:00,691
They must halt the series now
and offer an apology!

816
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,260
If they don't comply,
I'll take legal action to the end!

817
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,718
Apologize now, now, now!

818
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:09,718
Gang Min Ju is here!

819
00:51:11,597 --> 00:51:13,085
What are your plans against
the plagiarism lawsuit?

820
00:51:13,085 --> 00:51:14,804
Is the network going to air
the drama to the end?

821
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:16,273
What is your response?

822
00:51:17,138 --> 00:51:18,574
Please say something!

823
00:51:19,987 --> 00:51:22,337
Why are you doing this, Ms. Hwang?

824
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,065
It's dangerous!

825
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:29,366
It's dangerous!

826
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:55,105
- That's dangerous!
- Dangerous!

827
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,999
Look, open up!

828
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,449
Open the door!

829
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:16,189
I'm from the SBC. Let's talk!

830
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:21,762
Don't let her in.

831
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:22,909
Open up!

832
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:24,892
Open this door!

833
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:52,397
Ms. Hwang!

834
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:55,545
- Why is she here?
- Mi Rye!

835
00:52:55,545 --> 00:52:57,624
You were to stay behind. Why are you here?

836
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:00,786
Get back down.

837
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,496
Why are you standing on the ledge?

838
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:04,176
You might fall off.

839
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,718
Mi Rye, get back down.

840
00:53:06,718 --> 00:53:08,530
I told you to get down.

841
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,719
What are you doing? Get down here.

842
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:16,902
That's dangerous.

843
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:20,733
I'm SBC's chief producer Gang Min Ju.

844
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,869
Gang Min Ju?

845
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:25,189
The one who kept bugging me
on the phone to meet?

846
00:53:25,189 --> 00:53:26,357
Are you that Gang Min Ju?

847
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:27,413
Yes.

848
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,157
There is nothing to negotiate.
I won't drop the lawsuit.

849
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:32,565
Just take down the drama
and issue an apology.

850
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:34,309
- Right.
- Is that everything?

851
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:35,877
Is that everything you want?

852
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:37,456
Yes, that's right!

853
00:53:37,456 --> 00:53:39,512
I get you, so please come down.

854
00:53:39,512 --> 00:53:41,568
Are you admitting to plagiarism?

855
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:43,580
I want you to make that clear.

856
00:53:44,242 --> 00:53:46,921
Let's talk after you come down.

857
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,923
Do you take us for fools?

858
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:51,441
- Ms. Hwang, don't fall for it.
- You got it.

859
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:52,611
Even if we go to court,

860
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:55,217
you know that plagiarism
is hard to prove, right?

861
00:53:56,723 --> 00:54:00,307
I apologize for the inadequate
handling of this case.

862
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:02,418
But I can guarantee you that...

863
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:04,307
we will prevent this from repeating,

864
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,555
and you will be compensated
for the damages...

865
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:09,811
as well as receive active support...

866
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:11,948
for your future projects ahead.

867
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,347
Do you think this is about money?

868
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:15,493
We're not beggars! No way!

869
00:54:15,493 --> 00:54:18,027
- That's right!
- That's right!

870
00:54:18,027 --> 00:54:19,395
So that's what it comes down to.

871
00:54:19,395 --> 00:54:21,678
I don't need it, so leave.

872
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:26,741
Ms. Hwang, are you going to jump?

873
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:32,006
I trust that you won't be reckless.

874
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:36,146
Would you like me to show you
what recklessness is?

875
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:37,310
Is that what you want?

876
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,532
Ms. Hwang!

877
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,517
- I told you to come down!
- Ms. Hwang!

878
00:54:58,517 --> 00:54:59,671
Ms. Hwang!

879
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,329
Ms. Hwang, are you okay?

880
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:05,038
Ms. Hwang! Dear me!

881
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,355
Ms. Hwang!

882
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:15,996
(SBC's plagiarism controversy,

(Writer is injured and in hospital)

886
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,243
Ms. Hwang.

887
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:29,048
If you take such extreme measures...

888
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:32,410
So just admit to plagiarism
and issue an apology.

889
00:55:36,288 --> 00:55:37,808
I apologize.

890
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:41,952
I get the sentiment of your work
being snatched away.

891
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:44,672
And I know there is no way
to make up for it.

892
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:45,985
No amount of compensation...

893
00:55:45,985 --> 00:55:47,995
or recompense would be enough.

894
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:51,780
But we're willing to settle for any sum.

895
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,937
Do you think this is a show for money?

896
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,329
Simply for the craft we love,

897
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:00,329
we dedicate tireless days and nights.

898
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:03,440
But once out there, it gets copied.

899
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,112
Then we're forced into silence.

900
00:56:07,095 --> 00:56:11,309
It's like our child being taken away.

901
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:15,583
I don't want that happening anymore.

902
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:17,814
I understand.

903
00:56:17,814 --> 00:56:21,394
The network will face backlash
from this incident.

904
00:56:22,023 --> 00:56:24,746
But our drama will still be aired.

905
00:56:25,399 --> 00:56:28,433
It's bringing in the most profit
we've seen in years.

906
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,967
All we can do for you...

907
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:35,331
is some consolation money
and not much else.

908
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:38,139
I feel bad about that.

909
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:42,995
At least you're honest about it.

910
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:45,938
Ms. Hwang.

911
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:05,492
Let me be frank.

912
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:09,193
The script was planned and carried out...

913
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,970
by Ms. Ko here.

914
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,326
I merely helped her along the way.

915
00:57:13,326 --> 00:57:15,577
She is the original writer.

916
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:17,634
So if you want to compensate
or give an opportunity,

917
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,220
you should talk to her.

918
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,755
I'll drop the lawsuit if she asks.

919
00:57:21,755 --> 00:57:24,899
But even if you beg all day,

920
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,099
I won't do it.

921
00:57:28,506 --> 00:57:30,149
Me?

922
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,310
What did I...

923
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:34,541
I didn't really...

924
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,302
Is your name Mi Rye?

925
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,346
Yes.

926
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:55,482
I've got a question for my seven fans.

927
00:57:55,482 --> 00:57:57,998
Pushing through with this lawsuit...

928
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:00,559
will only add salt to your injury.

929
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:02,733
Yes, I see that.

930
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,539
What should I do? Any advice?

931
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:08,267
Settling the lawsuit without delay...

932
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,371
is in everyone's interest.

933
00:58:10,371 --> 00:58:12,724
I don't think you should drop it.

934
00:58:12,724 --> 00:58:14,259
Then what?

935
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:17,401
Is it too practical to accept
what's on the table?

936
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:18,745
So what should I do?

937
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,757
Fight to the end.

938
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:20,926
You might die trying.

939
00:58:20,926 --> 00:58:21,933
Just settle.

940
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:24,044
- Coward.
- Take the money.

941
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:25,525
- This is too hard.
- You decide.

942
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:27,211
I can't believe these guys.

943
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,470
Mi Rye.

944
00:58:32,997 --> 00:58:36,822
Everyone put in so much work.

945
00:58:36,822 --> 00:58:39,800
I know it must have been hard.

946
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,323
No, I just had fun.

947
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:45,706
But then your drama came out the same,

948
00:58:45,706 --> 00:58:47,974
so I suggested that she sue.

949
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:51,481
I don't want this happening
to other writers.

950
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,749
All right.

951
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:57,291
I'll be more careful and prevent
this from happening.

952
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,869
Yes, I hope you do that.

953
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:04,522
So help me out this once.

954
00:59:04,522 --> 00:59:06,467
If you make the decision...

955
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:10,090
I'm not in such a position.

956
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:14,652
And I'm bad at making decisions.

957
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:15,719
Sorry.

958
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:26,582
I think it'd be better to consult
my legal guardian.

959
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:30,810
Your legal guardian?

960
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,996
Yes, I think you should talk
to my big brother...

961
00:59:33,996 --> 00:59:36,486
because he's more objective
than I could ever be...

962
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:39,332
and he makes better decisions
than anyone I know.

963
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:41,411
Your brother?

964
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,082
Yes, I can't decide this alone.

965
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:46,644
I'll drop the case if my brother says so.

966
00:59:51,907 --> 00:59:53,947
She isn't even that young.

967
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:57,307
I got asked to talk to her brother
when she is past thirty.

968
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,036
You know we can't be picky.

969
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:01,603
We need to plead with anyone,
not just her brother.

970
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:04,634
Don't be stubborn but meet
with him tomorrow.

971
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,986
No, I'm busy tomorrow.

972
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:08,843
Are the shoots coming along okay?

973
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:10,491
That's not the problem!

974
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:12,739
Are you showing your true colors?

975
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,473
Producer Han, this isn't even my problem.

976
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:17,968
Yes, I know.

977
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:21,200
That's why I went through
Ms. Na's script today.

978
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,280
So you think about what's important...

979
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,482
and zero in on that choice.

980
01:00:26,482 --> 01:00:29,775
Why should I concentrate on you
when I'm already busy?

981
01:00:29,775 --> 01:00:30,803
Hang up!

982
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:37,626
Is one of my headlights out?

983
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:01,906
Jun Woo?

984
01:01:05,145 --> 01:01:06,546
Join me for breakfast.

985
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Why three plates?

986
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,480
Mi Rye never wakes up this early.

987
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,009
This is for our neighbor.

988
01:01:22,009 --> 01:01:23,788
- What? Our neighbor?
- Yes.

989
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,502
Hello, there.

990
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:31,786
- Good morning.
- Come in.

991
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:34,166
Your breakfast smells so good.

992
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:38,773
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

993
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:42,382
What? Do you know each other?

994
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:47,402
What is he doing here?

995
01:01:48,144 --> 01:01:49,796
This is my house.

996
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:55,449
Is this house yours?

997
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:57,918
Pack your bags!

998
01:01:57,918 --> 01:02:00,653
Sure, I want to right now!

999
01:02:00,653 --> 01:02:01,918
Why are you two like this?

1000
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,830
But I've already paid.
Who are you telling me to leave?

1001
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,689
I'm the owner of this house!

1002
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:10,681
Who was the person I signed with?

1003
01:02:11,126 --> 01:02:12,485
I'm starving.

1004
01:02:12,485 --> 01:02:13,773
Do you have breakfast ready?

1005
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,518
Jun Woo, I need some side dishes.

1006
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:17,622
Are you settled nicely here?

1007
01:02:17,622 --> 01:02:19,778
Why did you let anyone in without
a background check?

1008
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,338
Excuse me?

1009
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:22,498
What are you saying?

1010
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:24,658
Why are they like this?

1011
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,082
After sawing away last night,

1012
01:02:26,082 --> 01:02:27,881
you storm in here at daybreak!

1013
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,611
Reckless, stubborn, and making trouble,

1014
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:31,331
you only care about yourself!

1015
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,382
Bro!

1016
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,666
Bro?

1017
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,875
Is someone like him really your brother?

1018
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,312
Well, we're not blood-related.

1019
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:43,215
I don't know what's going on between you,

1020
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:45,359
but let's just talk it out.

1021
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,669
- No thanks!
- No, thank you!

1022
01:02:46,669 --> 01:02:47,868
Move out now!

1023
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:50,005
Sure, give me my money!

1024
01:02:50,005 --> 01:02:51,013
But why?

1025
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:54,071
Too loud! What's all this racket?

1026
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,175
Ko Mi Rye?

1027
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:01,377
I'm so sleepy.

1028
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:03,279
Now, wait...

1029
01:03:06,357 --> 01:03:08,334
How do you know my sister?

1030
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:11,105
Your sister?

1031
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:14,023
Yes, I think you should talk
to my big brother...

1032
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,447
because he's more objective
than I could ever be...

1033
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:19,211
and he makes better decisions
than anyone I know.

1034
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:24,206
Are you really her brother?

1035
01:03:24,206 --> 01:03:27,913
Yes, she's my sister. Why?

1036
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:48,902
(Second to Last Love)

1037
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:50,452
Try some.

1038
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,286
- You can squeeze it tightly.
- What?

1039
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,324
Why did you even eat this?

1040
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:55,651
I was offered some because
it squeezes tightly!

1041
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:57,099
She's not good to have around.

1042
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,316
I think she's nice.

1043
01:03:58,316 --> 01:03:59,316
You can't be serious.

1044
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,598
Don't do anything dangerous.

1045
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:05,124
You'd better not think about
coming here alone.

1046
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:06,724
Are you looking out for me?

1047
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:08,566
Don't you have a boyfriend?

1048
01:04:08,566 --> 01:04:10,629
This is something a man does for you.

1049
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:12,607
No wonder you're single.

1050
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,090
