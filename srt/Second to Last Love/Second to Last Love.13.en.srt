1
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:11,916
Ko Sang Sik.

2
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:26,836
I've got so much to tell you.

3
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,531
I don't want to hear it.

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,845
What do you mean?

5
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,532
The reason you couldn't tell me.

6
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,629
I know that now.

7
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,562
And it wasn't just out of guilt.

8
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,444
Gang Min Ju.

9
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:47,582
But...

10
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,950
what makes me angry is this.

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,684
Despite it all,

12
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,644
Ko Sang Sik,

13
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:17,886
I still have feelings for you.

14
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,123
Even as an adult,

15
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,518
some of our feelings can't stay hidden.

16
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,045
People label that
as something called love.

17
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:47,820
This guy buries it like it's a sin.

18
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:52,787
But love can't be hidden or evaded.

19
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,162
I don't know how you know my feelings,

20
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,609
but I can't be with you.

21
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,586
When the fire broke out,

22
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,522
I helped people escape with Eun Ho.

23
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:39,803
But then,

24
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,829
he ran to the window out of breath.

25
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,731
I should have held onto him tighter.

26
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,381
You tried to save him.

27
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,496
I'm the reason there was a fire.

28
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,982
I should have stopped the shoot,
but didn't manage to.

29
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,574
No matter what I say now,

30
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,895
I told you it'd merely be an excuse.

31
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,183
Ko Sang Sik.

32
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,338
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,653
I'm really sorry.

34
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,329
You don't know that man.

35
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:26,816
He was at the fire with Jang Eun Ho,

36
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,756
the guy you planned to marry.

37
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:32,219
Eun Ho died because of him, you know?

38
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:35,986
What?

39
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,744
Listen to me carefully.

40
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,953
When I left for an urgent matter,

41
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,689
I told him to wait for the generator.

42
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,210
But when the truck got delayed,

43
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:50,008
Ko Sang Sik recklessly used
the electricity there...

44
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:52,465
in order to shoot the scene,
which caused the fire.

45
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,636
I'm telling you,

46
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,545
it wasn't spontaneous combustion...

47
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:59,110
but rather an electrical overload.

48
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,355
Even if the broadcasting date
was approaching,

49
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:07,562
he should have waited for the generator.

50
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,803
But he forced the shoot after
scraping for power.

51
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:12,454
That's Ko Sang Sik.

52
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,342
But...

53
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,797
Why did they say otherwise?

54
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:23,357
Someone died. Eun Ho.

55
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,211
To evade responsibility,

56
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,038
they were quick to conceal the truth
and control the press.

57
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:34,442
Calling it an accidental fire...

58
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,972
suited the narrative of the environment.

59
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:44,429
How could they do such a thing?

60
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:51,145
A life was lost.

61
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,013
How could they do that?

62
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:12,446
Of course, love and forgiveness
are two separate things.

63
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,201
But I know Ko Sang Sik...

64
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,904
and how he's all about rules,
integrity, and safety.

65
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,655
So it's unthinkable what you did.

66
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,052
Gang Min Ju.

67
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,768
I'm sure you tried to save him.

68
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,471
You did your best in that blazing fire...

69
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:38,407
because it was you and no one else.

70
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:45,644
The cause was electrical overload,

71
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,076
but it couldn't be helped
with the nearing airtime.

72
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,860
So you couldn't have stopped the shoot.

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,428
Even if it were me,

74
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,824
I would have done the same thing.

75
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:58,252
The fault here is not intentional.

76
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:59,653
It was a mistake.

77
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,262
You never thought it could start a fire.

78
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,029
Stop trying to understand.

79
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,619
Just resent me.

80
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:09,237
Question me and demand that
I take responsibility.

81
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,548
Swear, scream, and hit me.

82
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:11,637
No.

83
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:15,337
Because I trust you.

84
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,957
I know how you have lived since.

85
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,311
You've done enough.

86
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,937
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

87
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,540
Our paths were meant to cross this way,

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,069
and she has learned what she
would have eventually.

89
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,415
If only we had never met.

90
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:52,041
If only we had passed by each other.

91
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:00,604
(Second to Last Love)

92
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:03,698
Are you for real?

93
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,274
Yes, my team got picked.

94
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,821
That's amazing, Mi Rye.

95
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,166
I knew you could do it.

96
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:12,875
I'm so happy.

97
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,108
There is someone genuinely thrilled
for me.

98
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,564
Well, of course.

99
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,216
I know how hard you have worked.

100
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,976
Let me go.

101
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:27,665
Don't kid around like that with me.

102
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:29,841
What's the matter?

103
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,613
I'm not some young guy.

104
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,041
What?

105
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:39,474
Goodness, what's the occasion?

106
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,187
It's Jun Woo's comeback.

107
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:44,000
No, we're celebrating Mi Rye's win.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,448
That's right.

109
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:46,601
Congratulations, Aunt Mi Rye.

110
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,519
See? She doesn't mean it at all.

111
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,860
Acting up because Uncle Jun Woo is back?

112
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:54,389
Sang Sik, have breakfast.

113
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,284
Jun Woo, can we have a moment?

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Okay.

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,906
You keep eating.

116
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,858
Do you have something to say?

117
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,522
Are you okay?

118
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:11,949
Goodness, that's why I'm back.

119
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,257
I cleared my head with some breeze,

120
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:15,508
so don't worry.

121
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:17,898
All right.

122
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,657
You? Did anything happen?

123
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,577
There wasn't much.

124
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,760
I'm not happy to hear that.

125
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,410
You and Min Ju should have
something going on.

126
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,957
I made way for that to happen.

127
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:32,568
Good heavens.

128
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,457
What happened was a long time ago.

129
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,798
You risked your life trying to save him,

130
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:42,560
and even lost your wife.

131
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,533
It's hard enough with your wounds,

132
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,971
so don't harbor unnecessary guilt.

133
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:53,517
You've earned it with all that
you've gone through.

134
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:54,525
So...

135
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,550
Okay.

136
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,483
Thanks.

137
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,659
My goodness.

138
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,041
You guys worked hard.

139
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,624
Well done.

140
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:13,552
Who knew there would be such a twist?

141
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,347
I had already thrown in the towel,

142
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,195
but it's nice to have a sweet reward.

143
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,432
I considered packing up with my kid...

144
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:21,737
and moving to the country.

145
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:23,506
You have a kid and got married?

146
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,531
Well, I was married.

147
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,146
Surprise. I'm quite the mystery.

148
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:32,245
Like with an onion or cabbage,
you have to peel me away.

149
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,761
After the reassessment,

150
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,857
they were leaning toward Producer Han.

151
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,641
So how did we win this pitch?

152
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:41,217
Right? I'm curious about that.

153
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:43,129
There is a meeting with the Deputy Mayor,

154
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,220
so we'll find out soon enough.

155
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:48,085
What a pretty cake.

156
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:50,701
Congratulations.

157
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,321
Thank you.

158
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:56,790
You should thank Chief Ko.

159
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,666
We faced a bit of an issue...

160
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,883
that could have damaged our reputation,

161
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:05,171
but it was corrected thanks
to his impartial judgment.

162
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,446
That's how it was announced.

163
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:15,093
Producer Han hasn't changed a bit.

164
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,804
Among the judges for the selection,

165
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:21,707
he conspired with Professor Ma,
who is a central figure.

166
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,619
And when it looked like I would win,

167
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,295
he suggested we make a deal.

168
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:29,671
What kind of deal?

169
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,515
They offered me whatever sum...

170
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,501
if I double-submit to another region.

171
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,444
Right then, I knew there was no chance.

172
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:46,667
How could I win when he was involved...

173
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,709
and playing from the inside?

174
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,238
They would surely knock me down.

175
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:53,020
Goodness.

176
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,622
It was double-submitted?

177
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:57,060
The panel was careful with the selection,

178
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,916
but who knew KBN would pull such a stunt?

179
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,941
Then let's quickly post an apology,

180
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,949
and from the works that made the cut,

181
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:06,364
we must select the next winner.

182
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:10,660
That's why Professor Ma, a leading judge,

183
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,691
reviewed them for the next highest score,

184
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,467
and it's from SBC.

185
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,606
SBC?

186
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,791
Here.

187
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:24,427
It's what Producer Han pitched.

188
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:25,632
Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,356
- Ms. Han.
- Yes, Chief Ko.

190
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,626
Get me the files I requested
for the drama evaluation.

191
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,733
Yes, sir.

192
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,085
(Drama Production Submissions
Evaluation Sheet)

193
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,577
What's that, Chief Ko?

194
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,686
The judges recorded their evaluation...

195
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,778
on these six original sheets.

196
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,241
But I have the originals.

197
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,415
This is a copy of the originals...

198
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,546
that you had taken.

199
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,882
The ID number belongs to Director Shin.

200
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:07,191
On September 24th, 2016, at 19:45,

201
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:09,136
after the evaluation ended,

202
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,538
Director Shin copied the six originals.

203
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,702
How did you get this?

204
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,159
Worried about the possibility
of score tampering,

205
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,551
I took extra precautions.

206
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:25,991
But somehow, unlike the evaluations,

207
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:27,889
this drama only ranked 4th place...

208
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,708
but was selected as the winning contender.

209
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:35,104
We must quickly correct this error...

210
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:38,038
and announce the rightful winner.

211
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,936
To save our city's reputation,
as well as your own,

212
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,899
this would be the best course of action.

213
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,201
Thank you.

214
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:56,872
I hear you exposed the tampering
in the drama selection.

215
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,431
That's impressive.

216
00:12:58,431 --> 00:12:59,995
I simply did my job.

217
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:04,278
What about the dishonest judge?

218
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:06,728
He was stripped of his professorship...

219
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,423
and is now under police investigation.

220
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,860
My word.

221
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,069
But Producer Han and Director Shin...

222
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:17,084
Were they in on the tampering?

223
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:18,834
Yes.

224
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:21,194
They will face the internal committee...

225
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,274
and be handled accordingly.

226
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:26,173
We have circumstantial evidence,
but not anything concrete.

227
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,157
I'll have to see them,
whether I like it or not.

228
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:32,794
Right.

229
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,236
That also includes you.

230
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:41,658
When my drama gets produced and filmed,

231
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:43,005
I need your cooperation.

232
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,038
Anyway, congratulations.

233
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,030
Take care.

234
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,150
(Ben Hur)

235
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,813
Ms. Koo, did you watch a movie?

236
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,406
Yes. Give it.

237
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,890
With who?

238
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:03,470
With a guy.

239
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,430
So your blind date finally went well?

240
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,169
No, it was with my pupil.

241
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:10,582
- Your pupil?
- He was in the past.

242
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,501
He went to my essay academy...

243
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,582
when I was still a hotshot teacher.

244
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,477
Then he's not a student now.

245
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,869
Of course not.

246
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,837
He's all grown up and ready to marry.

247
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:23,178
Then it's possible.

248
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:25,934
What do you even know?

249
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,211
When you come home from a date,

250
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,015
- don't send him mundane texts.
- What?

251
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:35,890
Send something like a photo
that piques his curiosity.

252
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,019
But don't try to explain anything.

253
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,019
Why not?

254
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,709
That keeps the conversation going.

255
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,189
And you can make him call.

256
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:45,797
My word.

257
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,188
Get closer with the arms.

258
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,755
Good grief.

259
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:52,463
Not yet with the hands.

260
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,807
Both men and women are
sensitive about hands.

261
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,903
Who are you to try and teach me?

262
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:00,501
Just learn if you don't know something.

263
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,786
You always get turned down.

264
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,446
I'm back.

265
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,055
I knew this would happen.

266
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,037
I'm so proud.

267
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:13,453
Who else would make it possible?

268
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,639
Don't you agree?

269
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,071
I'll get going.

270
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,726
Producer Han.

271
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:33,439
Why did you do this?
For the city drama selection.

272
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:37,177
Can I level with you?

273
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,490
You were my assistant when you first came.

274
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,848
But you soon soared past me...

275
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,794
and rose to fame as a star director.

276
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,865
You had numerous scouting offers.

277
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,530
What are you getting at?

278
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,678
I wanted to beat you just once.

279
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:01,165
To be someone you can respect,

280
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,870
even if it means being shameless.

281
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,893
Producer Han.

282
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:06,906
I kept my divorce from you,

283
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:10,514
fearing it might make you uneasy.

284
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:14,183
Frankly, I wanted your approval,

285
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,394
and when the time was right,

286
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:18,755
I had hoped to propose to you.

287
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,003
What? Propose?

288
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,875
But that's out the window.

289
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:31,579
Now you know I'm a despicable man.

290
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,599
Every time I was in trouble,

291
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:38,712
I was grateful you came to my rescue.

292
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:42,370
But I've never been seen as...

293
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,379
anything worthwhile in your eyes.

294
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:46,390
Good heavens.

295
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,710
I'm taken aback.

296
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,272
I never knew you had these feelings.

297
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,335
Producer Han.

298
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,607
Still, this is unacceptable.

299
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:02,819
Even if you wanted respect
and acknowledgment,

300
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,800
how could you stoop low enough to cheat?

301
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,095
You don't have to be perfect
or always be in the right.

302
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,191
We all have our weak moments.

303
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:13,010
But you shouldn't have been malicious.

304
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:17,548
Sorry, I'm really messed up.

305
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:26,987
Ko Sang Sik.

306
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,827
Why are you making it so difficult?

307
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,580
You should just stop now.

308
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,413
What are you saying, Director Shin?

309
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,750
You better listen.

310
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,320
Do you think you can mess with me?

311
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:49,069
I can cast you aside as easy as a blink.

312
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,704
You know I have that power.

313
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,861
Cross me one more time.

314
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:56,873
I'll send you to the gutter
and finish you off.

315
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,004
Finish me off?

316
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,315
Who will go down first?

317
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:04,477
The imported grapes,

318
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,315
the rigged drama selection,

319
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,850
and the botched ferry repair.

320
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,404
What comes next?

321
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,367
I'll take you down for good.

322
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:13,807
Bang!

323
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,103
Goodness.

324
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,518
Do you work here part-time?

325
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:29,011
Yes.

326
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,124
How was your acting class?

327
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:33,059
The acting coach you recommended...

328
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,636
is quite scary, but also a blast.

329
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,660
I never felt this way, even for modeling.

330
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,662
I hope that's a sign of passion.

331
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,820
I hope so, too.

332
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,303
Now I'm into something other than Jun.

333
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,042
This is a new feeling.

334
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:54,184
By the way,
I saw the Woori City Drama results.

335
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,174
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

336
00:18:56,484 --> 00:19:01,076
Then, will I get a part in the drama?

337
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:04,140
Well, it might be too early for that.

338
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,822
I don't mind a passing role.

339
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,366
It would mean a lot to me.

340
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:13,151
This place feels like a second home.

341
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,870
Really? That's good.

342
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,380
They stopped accepting donations
starting next month?

343
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,404
Yes.

344
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,997
You've been sending monthly deposits...

345
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,452
from your salary account,

346
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,944
but it must be suspended
for Happy Nursing Home.

347
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,976
Shall I find you another worthy cause?

348
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:40,193
No, I'll figure this out first.

349
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:47,311
My goodness, you're back.

350
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,421
Yes. Have you been well?

351
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,108
Yes.

352
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,517
- Did you have a nice trip?
- Of course.

353
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,708
I foraged plants in the mountains,

354
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,717
picked abalones along the shores,

355
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,082
and collected honey from beehives.

356
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,707
That must have been hard.

357
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,343
No, it was nice to sweat profusely.

358
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,614
I heard you visited Ji Seon
at the hospital.

359
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,131
I did.

360
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,051
Why are you taking care of her?

361
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,067
Because I want to.

362
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:18,643
I've been through what she did,
so I worry for her.

363
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:22,229
It's good to see her better now.

(Eun Ho's Mother
300 Dollars)

366
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:44,745
What makes me angry is this.

367
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,128
Despite it all, Ko Sang Sik,

368
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:52,673
I still have feelings for you.

369
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,202
I'm sure you tried to save him.

370
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,597
You did your best in that blazing fire...

371
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:01,888
because it was you...

372
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:04,873
and no one else.

373
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,396
Why aren't you taking my calls?

374
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,567
Look here, Dokgo Bong.

375
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,279
Why are you acting this way?

376
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,776
You were nice to me,
and then cut off contact.

377
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,371
Is this how you play the field?

378
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:50,176
Getting older means more wounds,

379
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,955
and once they appear,
they take time to heal.

380
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:58,533
If we don't become numb to the pain,

381
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,014
we can't survive at this age.

382
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,808
Are you telling me...

383
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:05,047
to swallow my injured pride...

384
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,660
and become numb to it?

385
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:12,006
I'm the one feeling hurt because
of your busy schedule.

386
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:15,208
I waited for your call day after day,

387
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,406
but you're on your own time.

388
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:20,698
Must I answer every time you call?

389
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,404
Is that why you're upset?

390
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:27,829
I need to be alone right now.

391
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:28,829
So leave.

392
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,080
Leave. Didn't you hear me?

393
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,239
Fine, I'm leaving.

394
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:50,180
When precious moments arrive,

395
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,810
don't question them but savor them.

396
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,093
At this stage in life,

397
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:56,684
there is no guarantee of a tomorrow.

398
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:21,427
- Boss, there you are.
- You're here.

399
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:24,112
- Hello.
- Hello, producer.

400
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,112
Hello.

401
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Boss.

402
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,921
Yes?

403
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,563
Are things the same as always?

404
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:48,563
Yes.

405
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,766
- Yeong Ae.
- Yes?

406
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:56,562
What if the person you like...

407
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,531
did something wrong...

408
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:00,960
and gets hurt every time he sees you?

409
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,626
If I got him cornered,

410
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,016
he'd have to do whatever I say.

411
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:06,716
What?

412
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:09,342
Or I'd tell him to forget it completely.

413
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:12,314
If I truly like him
and want to be with him.

414
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,438
What if the pain is too deep
and can't be forgotten?

415
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:21,029
Then seeing each other would be hard,

416
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,001
and it would be difficult
to continue things.

417
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:26,672
Who are you talking about?

418
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,602
Does it have to do with our story?

419
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,351
No.

420
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:33,675
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

421
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,535
Are you sure about the new face?

422
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,535
Why?

423
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:39,353
It's refreshing,

424
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,389
but there might be some risk.

425
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,500
She really came.

426
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:53,913
I'll step out for a moment.

427
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:55,715
Who? Who came?

428
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,734
My goodness. Producer. Hello.

429
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:03,792
Are you sure you're here for me?

430
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:07,265
Of course. Who else would I visit?

431
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:10,152
Because of Producer Han's failure?

432
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,735
I'm sorry about that.

433
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:14,227
I wasn't thinking straight back then.

434
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:15,520
Have a seat.

435
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,681
I thought you were only doing
movies, and no dramas.

436
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,017
What are you talking about?

437
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:23,229
If that were true, I wouldn't have
signed with Producer Han.

438
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:26,046
I really want this role.

439
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,287
I'll work hard.

440
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,165
Honestly, it's not easy to come...

441
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,694
and beg you as a top actress.

442
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:34,884
If your pride's hurt, you can leave.

443
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:36,420
No.

444
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,622
I want to commit to you.

445
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,091
- Fine.
- Really?

446
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:47,212
- But you'll have to wait.
- What?

447
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,222
I've chosen some actors from auditions,

448
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:51,092
so let's see how you blend together.

449
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,445
No need to worry about that.

450
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:55,790
They would be thrilled to work with me.

451
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:59,071
I said watch what you say.

452
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:00,500
All right.

453
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,565
You're still alive and kicking.

454
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:06,130
You made it through such a competition.

455
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,165
Right?

456
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,279
Goodness.

Say hello to the Deputy Mayor.

Hello. Good work. Nice to meet you.

Thank you.

- I see.
- Hello.

465
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:28,628
You worked hard.

466
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,596
- Isn't she prettier in person?
- Yes, indeed.

Isn't that Ko Sang Sik?

468
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,649
I'll see you in a bit. Just a minute.

You are, right?

472
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:58,807
Yes. Hello.

473
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,451
I was right.

474
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:04,147
It's been a long time.

475
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:06,350
So many years have passed.

476
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:10,551
What are you doing here?

Well, I work here.

478
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,511
My goodness, I didn't know that.

479
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,470
That's good.

480
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,808
Do you know each other?

481
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,104
Of course.

482
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:25,058
When I was working on KBN's
"Paradise for Youth,"

483
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:28,865
he was the assistant director.

484
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:30,432
- Really?
- Yes.

485
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:35,169
You quit after the fire incident.

486
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,862
Look...

487
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:41,934
It still haunts me to this day.

488
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:45,550
Someone on the camera team...

489
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,700
What was his name again?

490
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,586
- Well...
- I'm sorry.

491
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,849
I'll have to leave.

492
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,794
So he quit and became a public official.

493
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,511
Come this way.

494
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,634
Okay. I'll see you.

495
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,714
Are you okay?

496
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,870
Some people still recognize you.

497
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,501
Don't be stressed over it.

498
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,270
As long as we're working together,

499
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,236
there will be more of this
until the production ends.

500
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:27,108
That could be hard on both of us.

501
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:28,856
I'm okay with that.

502
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:30,175
But I'm not okay with that.

503
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:33,497
You struggled to bury it deep,

504
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:35,867
but now it keeps coming up,

505
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,697
and you even have to explain it.

506
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:39,542
This could keep repeating.

507
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,956
I said I'm okay with that.

508
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:08,614
Hello.

509
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:11,654
- Who is he?
- Your new boyfriend?

510
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:12,886
You go on ahead.

511
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:18,347
How about I buy you a treat?

512
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:20,211
Spaghetti? Stir-fried rice cake?

513
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:22,605
Stir-fried rice cake?
Do you think I'm a kid?

514
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:25,327
Of course, you're only 15.

515
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:27,603
But you're not much older.

516
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:28,603
Ye Ji.

517
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:32,967
Who is he?

518
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,871
Aren't you a college student?

519
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:38,984
Me? I'm in eleventh grade. Why?

520
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:40,886
What's your problem?

521
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,403
We broke up.

522
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,438
Let's go.

523
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,515
What's the point of me worrying to death?

524
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:58,621
My husband doesn't even care
about his son's education.

525
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:00,296
I can't stand it anymore.

526
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:07,324
(Angel without Wings)

527
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,566
Hello?

528
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:23,864
Yes, who is this?

529
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:28,764
Can I ask for your name?

530
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,907
Who are you to ask that?

531
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,480
You have won a giveaway.

532
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,544
That's okay.

533
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,657
Sorry.

534
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:40,145
Wait a minute.

535
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:42,740
Do you know Richard Park?

536
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:44,408
Yes.

537
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:48,705
He's the one who signed you up.

538
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,769
Just pretend you don't know that.

539
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,928
Really? What's the giveaway?

540
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,631
There are vitamins, necklaces, and more.

541
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,566
Please tell me your name, age,

542
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,014
and address, and we'll send it out.

543
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:03,050
Really?

544
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,804
Come on, Ae Gyeong. Get in the car.

545
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,083
I'm coming.

546
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:10,230
Please leave your number
for me to text later.

547
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,672
I'm busy right now.

548
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:21,075
That sounded like my husband.

549
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:25,070
What? What was her name?

550
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,952
Ae Gyeong? Get in the car, hurry.

551
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,803
Get in the car, honey?

552
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,853
What? What car?

553
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:34,893
What honey?

554
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,442
What was the call about?

555
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:41,611
It's nothing.

556
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:44,043
You're so sneaky.

557
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:47,563
What do you mean?

558
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,278
Don't secretly sign me up for stuff.

559
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,354
Why would I do that?

560
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:55,244
Never mind.

561
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,962
This car looks better.

562
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,306
In my opinion,

563
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:01,904
it's a perfect match for you.

564
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:03,185
- Right.
- Give it a try.

565
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:05,667
You should ride shotgun.

566
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,397
- Me, too?
- Sure.

567
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,864
This is cozy and nice.

568
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:21,758
I wish we could take off somewhere.

569
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:23,551
That's not hard.

570
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:24,985
It's not like we have a family.

571
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,778
What a nice car.

572
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:47,116
Why are you here again?

573
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,232
I told you not to come.

574
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,775
I saw these persimmons after work,

575
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:53,498
and I thought you'd like them.

576
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:56,442
You haven't forgotten.

577
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:02,053
(Happy Nursing Home)

578
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:03,623
Yes, that's right.

579
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,609
She declined the donations.

580
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:10,262
Can you explain why she made
such a decision?

581
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:12,646
With her worsened condition,

582
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:16,000
she might be thinking it's hopeless.

583
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,489
It's not uncommon for people
nearing the end.

584
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:24,509
Why don't you meet her this time?

585
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,329
She has been curious.

586
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,150
No.

587
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,672
There might not be another chance.

588
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:49,960
Ms. Jang, do you remember this?

589
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,920
Of course.

590
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:59,351
Eun Ho clasped it in his hand.

591
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,183
After wondering why he had this,

592
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,584
I finally found out.

593
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,254
What?

594
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:12,150
That day, someone held his hand,

595
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,696
trying to save him till the end.

596
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,969
This belongs to that person.

597
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,264
Really?

598
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:25,777
He tried to save Eun Ho?

599
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,921
Do you see this mark here?

600
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,653
Yes.

601
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:36,929
It's the initials of his name.

602
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,440
Who is he?

603
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:42,327
Who tried to save Eun Ho
in that situation?

604
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,724
Ko Sang Sik.

605
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:49,829
He used to work with your son.

606
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,128
So that's what happened.

607
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,496
I see it now.

608
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:58,951
That means...

609
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,727
Eun Ho was grateful.

610
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,856
That's why he held it.

611
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:13,026
Now I know.

612
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:15,623
I'm glad to learn this...

613
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,383
before I die.

614
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:35,871
Please wait here.

615
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,345
Ms. Jang.

616
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,656
Hello.

617
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:51,135
Will you meet a visitor outside?

618
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,949
What visitor?

619
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,165
Who is it?

620
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,402
He's been her patron for a long time.

621
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,067
Really?

622
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:03,500
When I asked to meet him,
he never bothered.

623
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,139
But now he shows up when
I decline his help?

624
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,399
Yes, Ms. Jang.

625
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,948
Will you meet him?

626
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:14,105
Of course. I've been very curious.

627
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:17,438
I should meet the guy.

628
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:25,670
Please come in.

629
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:35,437
My word.

630
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,421
Hello.

631
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,338
I'm glad you came.

632
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:57,111
I didn't know you had a visitor.

633
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,647
I'll come back later.

634
00:36:58,647 --> 00:36:59,811
Ko Sang Sik.

635
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:07,444
Who? Do you know him?

636
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,111
Yes.

637
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,426
Come in. Why would you leave?

638
00:37:15,912 --> 00:37:17,176
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:21,403
You're such a handsome man.

640
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:26,515
Have you been her patron all this time?

641
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,585
Come over here.

642
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,580
Let me take a closer look.

643
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:45,360
Thank you for all your help.

644
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:46,874
You're too kind.

645
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:52,043
I couldn't save Eun Ho.

646
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:53,717
I'm sorry to visit you so late.

647
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:03,285
The bracelet belongs to him.

648
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:09,414
Do you mean he tried to save Eun Ho?

649
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:11,708
Yes, Ms. Jang.

650
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:23,031
Thank you.

651
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,581
Thank you.

652
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:31,002
You struggled to save my son.

653
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,942
Eun Ho clasped it in his hand.

654
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:43,404
I should have saved him but couldn't.

655
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:45,768
I'm really sorry.

656
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,219
I don't know what to say.

657
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:56,315
Why did you come so late?

658
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:01,928
I wondered why my son had to die...

659
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,344
and why there was a fire.

660
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:10,785
But nobody explained it to me.

661
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,128
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:23,608
I should have taken it upon myself
to explain, but I couldn't.

663
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,512
I'm really sorry.

664
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,513
I didn't know you were donating.

665
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,166
I don't know what to say.

666
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,976
For some time now,

667
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,663
I couldn't properly tell Ms. Jang
about the incident,

668
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,881
which made me feel sorrow and regret.

669
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:12,488
But before she passes away,

670
00:40:12,488 --> 00:40:15,951
I'm glad that she has learned
her son had help.

671
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:17,521
That brings some comfort.

672
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:19,107
Thank you for saying it like that.

673
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,909
But...

674
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:25,680
Despite knowing the truth about
what started the fire,

675
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,500
I couldn't speak up,
something I deeply regret.

676
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,567
I can't forgive myself.

677
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,773
Don't say that.

678
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:37,605
You were also a victim that day.

679
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,985
You almost died and barely made it out.

680
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:46,649
I repeatedly told myself
there was nothing I could do.

681
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,860
But when a kid fell on the street,
it felt like my fault.

682
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,580
And when Ye Ji caught a cold,

683
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,399
it felt like karma catching up with me.

684
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,740
Everything that is bad and wrong
in the world...

685
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,884
somehow feels like my own responsibility.

686
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:03,575
So it's been agonizing to live each day.

687
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:14,435
Here it is.

688
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:15,627
How pretty.

689
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,071
Try it.

690
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:19,557
How refreshing.

691
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,338
How does it taste?

692
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,260
Sweet and sour.

693
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,229
There is some bitterness at the end.

694
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:28,509
Really?

695
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:30,567
Maybe I added too much rum.

696
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,793
Delicious.

697
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:38,539
This is alcohol.

698
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,380
Okay. What time is it?

699
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:43,508
- Look at the time.
- Why?

700
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:45,828
I need to buy some books.

701
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,817
Okay, I'll come with you.

702
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,367
What? Why?

703
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:50,713
What do you think?

704
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:52,633
I'll look at some cooking books.

705
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:57,007
Really? Wait, I need to get changed.

706
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,075
Okay.

707
00:42:14,424 --> 00:42:15,554
I'm screwed.

708
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,937
What's taking you?

709
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,667
Wait a minute.

710
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:24,490
Just wait a little bit more.

711
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:41,712
What are you doing?

712
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,260
Why didn't you knock?

713
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,133
How about we stop by here?

714
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,035
How do you know about this place?

715
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:28,890
You said we live to be amazed.

716
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,930
Good heavens, it's beautiful.

717
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,713
How pretty.

718
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,127
I thought we could enjoy it together.

719
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,488
There is a festival going on.

720
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:44,117
You two look great together.

721
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:45,758
How about I take your picture?

722
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:47,210
No, it's okay.

723
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,208
Why not? Let's take one with a nice view.

724
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,744
Then just one shot.

725
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:04,461
Did you have a couple's fight?

726
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:07,890
Get closer with your arm around her.

727
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,397
Pull her waist toward you.

728
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:11,388
All right.

729
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,572
Think of your first night together...

730
00:44:13,572 --> 00:44:17,081
and your first kiss.

731
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,722
Kiss. Yes, you remember.

732
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,801
All right.

733
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:21,789
That's good.

734
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,415
Sorry, but get closer.

735
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:24,501
This way. Good.

736
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,382
All right.

737
00:44:26,382 --> 00:44:29,641
You look great. Two, three.

738
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,818
They say becoming an adult
requires a thousand struggles.

739
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:37,200
Even as adults,

740
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,948
we're caught between mistakes
and responsibilities,

741
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:44,559
only to endure painful regrets
and times of remorse.

742
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,211
Must we overcome such suffering...

743
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:50,963
to truly embrace ourselves as adults?

744
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,253
Why didn't you call me?

745
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:11,561
Here.

746
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:22,239
You'll be swamped with work,
with no time to spare.

747
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:25,583
I've got plenty of time.

748
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:28,979
Since your content has been selected,

749
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:31,269
you'll really dive into work.

750
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:35,809
There is a cooking guy in our drama.

751
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,160
Yes, I'm aware.

752
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,508
You could help out as a food stylist.

753
00:45:40,508 --> 00:45:41,579
Forget it.

754
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:44,750
Why are you dragging me into it?

755
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,332
We'll need an expert anyway.

756
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:51,010
What's wrong?

757
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,851
Are you still feeling uneasy
about Producer Gang?

758
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:55,914
No.

759
00:45:55,914 --> 00:45:57,141
Then what?

760
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,827
Min Ju.

761
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:03,541
I hope she ends up with your brother.

762
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,624
What? What's that about?

763
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:29,332
How about we sit over there?

764
00:46:31,395 --> 00:46:32,397
Sure.

765
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:51,880
Do you have something to say?

766
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:55,184
It's about Sang Sik.

767
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:59,883
This is from some time ago and is painful,

768
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,376
but can I talk about it?

769
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:04,004
Sure, go ahead.

770
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:12,242
You know that fire incident?

771
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:20,883
Sang Sik also lost his wife.

772
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,082
If she had been alive,

773
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:31,520
he would have owned up to it
and revealed everything.

774
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:34,830
But he lost his colleague...

775
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:39,039
and his wife on the same day.

776
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:45,839
If he had left the set earlier...

777
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,510
and met his wife as they promised,

778
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:54,119
such a thing wouldn't have happened.

779
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:24,020
Sang Sik, Hee Su. How pretty.

780
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,016
I'll be back.

781
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,310
Daddy will be back.

782
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,041
You have to protect Mommy.

783
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:36,581
You said today's shoot will end early.

784
00:48:37,408 --> 00:48:40,128
Then meet me later. I'll treat you.

785
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,827
- Let's buy our baby stuff.
- Okay.

786
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:52,523
Hurry! Get out!

787
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:53,605
Get out!

788
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:55,489
Get out!

789
00:48:55,489 --> 00:48:56,733
Hurry! Get out!

790
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:04,221
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?

791
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:06,427
- My goodness. Call for help!
- Call 911!

792
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:14,849
It's amniotic fluid embolism.

793
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:16,562
Prepare for surgery and call her guardian.

794
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:19,518
Eun Ho!

795
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:22,542
Eun Ho!

796
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:37,445
Sang Sik.

797
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:39,234
- Let go of me!
- Sang Sik.

798
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,071
We did everything we could.

799
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,073
I'm sorry.

800
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:51,790
The baby was saved,

801
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,762
but your wife passed away due to
amniotic fluid embolism.

802
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:46,488
It was so much harder for you.

803
00:51:47,615 --> 00:51:49,107
Why didn't you tell me?

804
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:51,754
What do you mean?

805
00:51:51,754 --> 00:51:53,838
On the very same day,

806
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:56,350
you lost your colleague...

807
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:01,948
but also your wife.

808
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,148
While trying to save him,

809
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:08,172
you couldn't meet her, and...

810
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:09,654
Did Jun Woo tell you?

811
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:11,932
Yes.

812
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,764
Why make it look like only I suffered...

813
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:17,808
when you went through so much more?

814
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,607
I couldn't save anyone in the end.

815
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:24,129
Being alive makes me guilty.

816
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:30,029
Can't you...

817
00:52:33,588 --> 00:52:35,999
Can't you think of me even a little?

818
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:39,374
If you consider me for a tiny bit,

819
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,447
you could let go of the past.

820
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:44,699
I want to do so desperately.

821
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:48,591
I thought it was behind me, but...

822
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:49,802
Okay, then.

823
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:54,232
We can bury our past for each other.

824
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:55,305
I can't...

825
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,101
look at you...

826
00:53:05,627 --> 00:53:07,526
as if nothing happened.

827
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:53,343
Should I leave?

828
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,158
I want her to stay.

829
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,810
If I'm causing him pain and agony,

830
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,548
maybe it's best that I leave.

831
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:17,986
Even if it's painful to see her,

832
00:54:19,816 --> 00:54:21,242
I want to make her stay.

833
00:55:54,763 --> 00:55:57,558
What? This...

834
00:55:57,558 --> 00:55:58,735
This is...

835
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:18,828
You wanted to see me?

836
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:24,761
I have something to say.

837
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:44,713
Do you think Cheol Su
and Yeong Hee lived happily?

838
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:52,769
Whether on their own or together?

839
00:57:00,998 --> 00:57:02,444
I must make it hard for you.

840
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,314
That would be me.

841
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:21,552
I want you to be happy, Ko Sang Sik.

842
00:57:43,163 --> 00:57:47,464
Then I'll be off.

843
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:16,587
So don't try to learn too much.

844
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:18,255
But how can I let this go?

845
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:21,703
Our late sister-in-law made it for him.

846
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:25,582
Why would our neighbor have it
and leave it secretly?

847
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:29,021
I mean, she couldn't be with him.

848
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:31,693
Right?

849
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:33,658
What's wrong with that?

850
01:00:33,658 --> 01:00:34,964
How can you say that?

851
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:40,113
Jun Woo, you had a thing with her.

852
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:42,498
How can she go out with my brother?
I object.

853
01:00:42,498 --> 01:00:43,813
Why not?

854
01:00:43,813 --> 01:00:45,957
We should accept his decision.

855
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:47,241
Accept what?

856
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,241
Goodness.

857
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:52,349
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

858
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,349
What is it?

859
01:00:54,555 --> 01:00:56,853
What are you hiding from me?

860
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,555
What?

861
01:01:00,555 --> 01:01:02,994
Isn't this what my mom made?

862
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:04,303
But why are there two?

863
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,483
I came here to be happy.

864
01:01:50,483 --> 01:01:53,285
And there were such moments.

865
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:30,568
But for his sake,

866
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:33,947
I realize that I can't stay here.

867
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,571

868
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,587
Your call cannot be connected...

869
