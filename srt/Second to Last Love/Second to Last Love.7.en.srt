1
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,887
Have you got disinfectant at home?
I can bring it over if you don't.

2
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,572
Come over here.

3
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:58,802
- Where?
- Just over here.

4
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,632
I apologize for being too harsh earlier.

5
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,248
It's okay.

6
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,687
I was deluded into thinking
that I was capable.

7
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,206
It was the anger talking.

8
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,887
There's no need to blame yourself.

9
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,169
It's not self-blame, but the truth.

10
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,416
It feels like I'm being pushed aside...

11
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,235
and getting treated as a has-been.

12
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,165
I think you're pushing yourself
too hard about work.

13
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:42,598
No wonder you keep tripping.

14
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:49,427
Rest for now. Nobody is on your back.

15
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:52,539
Make this an excuse to take time off work.

16
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,619
What if I lose my edge for real?

17
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,677
People have been joking that
I've lost my touch.

18
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,828
It's okay at our age.

19
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,243
That's normal.

20
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:04,371
That is why I should put in more effort.

21
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,571
So that I don't trip.

22
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,459
You won't if you take a break.

23
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,806
Don't try to run, but walk.

24
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:13,727
I'll try.

25
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,403
I've been practicing something
with my team these days.

26
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:20,668
I'm given a hard time about messing up.

27
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,601
They treat me like an old geezer.

28
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,070
What are you practicing?

29
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,456
It's something to promote Woori City.

30
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,766
I do a bit of dancing and singing.

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,093
I already know what your dancing is like.

32
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,897
You showed me at that concert.

33
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,699
Why are you bringing that up?

34
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:39,813
I'd like to see you perform sometime.

35
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,075
Have you got anything stronger
than coffee?

36
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,099
I think you already drank a lot.

37
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,037
Another drink won't change things.

38
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,597
What kind of music do you like?

39
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,472
I love all the old tracks.

40
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,495
There is a DJ vibe here.

41
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,208
You even have tons of movies.

42
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,338
("Paradise for Youth")

43
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,369
Now, I'm starting to suspect your past.

44
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:06,841
What did you use to do before?

45
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:10,211
It's just a hobby of mine.

46
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,983
You should go home and get some sleep.

47
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,318
I will do so after finishing this.

48
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,739
By the way, about the garden.

49
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,364
I used vinegar water,
which bleached the leaves,

50
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,012
and it became worse.

51
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,396
So I added more, but it turned whiter.

52
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,452
What?

53
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:10,969
You should have told me earlier
if that had happened.

54
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:12,918
That's why I'm telling you now.

55
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,401
Just don't tell my dad.

56
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,473
It shouldn't be a big deal,

57
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:23,440
but he could overreact
hearing it from you.

58
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,397
Then what do I get in return?

59
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:28,817
Next time, tell me right away.

60
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,465
Don't decide on your own.

61
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,617
So they can grow well.

62
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,098
Okay, I'll do that.

63
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,002
I thought it was our secret,

64
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,958
but she has already told Dad.

65
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:45,053
(Second to Last Love)

66
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,473
(Episode 7)

67
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,652
Cheers.

68
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:39,486
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

69
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,205
Good heavens.

70
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,963
Look, Jun Woo.

71
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,806
- Sang Sik.
- Where are you going?

72
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,079
To Min Ju's place.

73
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,441
It seemed like something made
her upset yesterday.

74
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,992
I thought we could exercise together.

75
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,217
Hold it.

76
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,694
Let her get some extra sleep.

77
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,121
Sleep? How would you know that?

78
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,797
It's still early for her to be awake.

79
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:07,743
And you said something upset her.

80
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,445
She might have had a drink.

81
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,758
Do you think so? I should call her.

82
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,699
You're calling her?

83
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,474
You can leave a voicemail...

84
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,487
She's not answering.

85
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,789
Maybe she's still sleeping.

86
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,910
So you should go alone.

87
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,696
Okay. Do you want to come?

88
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,768
No, I'm not feeling great.

89
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,183
Hurry back. Let's eat breakfast.

90
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,749
- All right.
- Okay.

91
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:01,739
Why am I here?

92
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,442
I can't believe myself.

93
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:39,912
Hello.

94
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:41,685
Did you sleep well?

95
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,153
Why didn't you wake me up?

96
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,786
You're the one who fell asleep.

97
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,226
Nothing happened, right?

98
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,321
Why would something happen?

99
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:54,952
Are you sure nothing happened?

100
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,478
Yes.

101
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:59,337
Good grief, I can't remember a thing.

102
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,494
Well, that's good to know, then.

103
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:03,505
Bye.

104
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,112
You should be careful.

105
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,645
- Okay.
- Right.

106
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,636
Good? Good to know?

107
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:20,790
My word.

108
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:24,943
That hurts.

109
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,905
I think you're pushing yourself
too hard about work.

110
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,405
No wonder you keep tripping.

111
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,417
You won't if you take a break.

112
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,779
Don't try to run, but walk.

113
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,170
He seems more decent than I thought.

114
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,691
Here, I'll set it down.

115
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,525
- Why aren't you standing up?
- Okay.

116
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,716
Don't you have any manners in this family?

117
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,340
At least make eye contact during meals.

118
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,723
- Yes.
- Kids are like that these days.

119
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,922
The times have changed since
our parents were alive.

120
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:36,365
I was studying just now.

121
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:39,237
Weren't you at the study cafe
until late yesterday?

122
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:42,190
You know how studying never ends.

123
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,446
Why start something with no end?

124
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,930
Hun wouldn't know that, because
he never started.

125
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:50,359
Since Ye Ji is focused on her studies,

126
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,676
I prepared something special.

127
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,945
Great, I've been dieting.

128
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,106
I'll just have this.

129
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:58,288
Dieting? How would that help you?

130
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,225
Why are you so mad?

131
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:07,785
Eat your breakfast.

132
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,570
Good morning. How are you?

133
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,371
Sit down. Get up earlier tomorrow.

134
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,258
You weren't at the study cafe.

135
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,399
Where were you?

136
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,223
I was with Hyun Seok.

137
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,633
What were you doing with him at night?

138
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,833
We hung out with our friends
since it was our 50th day.

139
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,336
Your 50th day? What’s that?

140
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,199
It's what kids do these days.

141
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,231
You've been dating him for 50 days?

142
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,640
Invite him over to meet your aunt.

143
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,800
You've been dating for 50 days?

144
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,176
Then why did you lie to me?

145
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,647
How could I tell you anything?

146
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,095
Especially about Hyun Seok.

147
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:47,104
You only get the wrong idea
with zero love cells.

148
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,130
What don't I have?

149
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,647
- Love cells?
- Yes.

150
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,088
I don't have love cells.

151
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:55,597
Maybe it's my low hemoglobin level.

152
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:58,725
Love cells, wake up.

153
00:12:58,725 --> 00:12:59,821
Please wake up.

154
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,630
You should wake up, first.

155
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,790
And get rid of the tent outside!

156
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,083
Why would you pitch a tent
out front like a homeless person?

157
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,409
Ye Ji.

158
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,424
You get your act together, got it?

159
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,424
Okay.

160
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,519
What are you saying?

161
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,983
Do you think Producer Han is working
on the Woori City drama?

162
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,560
Do you know that script from a rookie?

163
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,439
It's the one you made us vote for.

164
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,441
Yes.

165
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,654
The 8 to 2 outcome reflected
I had lost my touch.

166
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:31,685
Anyway, I think he's working with that.

167
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,965
The division head asked me to do it.

168
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:35,853
So why would he ask him?

169
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,017
That's why it's strange.

170
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:41,741
What's wrong with your leg? Are you hurt?

171
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,510
I tripped.

172
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,782
What?

173
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,205
Anyway, I'll finish eating and go.

174
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,860
Boss?

175
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,406
(Do you want to disconnect?)

176
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:50,737
Why is it doing this?

177
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,351
My word, is it broken?

178
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:06,365
What? I lack love cells?

179
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,360
And she's been dating for 50 days?

180
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:10,976
Good heavens.

181
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,198
Hello, Ms. Hwang.

182
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:20,785
Thanks, but I should get back to drawing.

183
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:23,874
I turned down the network.

184
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,364
It's because of a family thing.

185
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:28,434
Yes, I know it's a great chance.

186
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,697
Honestly, I would love to try.

187
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,328
Anyway, that's my decision.

188
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:37,311
There will be another great
breakthrough for me someday.

189
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,726
Mi Rye, come down and help me.

190
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,008
All right.

191
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,310
Ms. Hwang, I'll call you later.

192
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,310
Stay strong!

193
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,430
When I was a kid, I thought growing up...

194
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,337
would make me good at everything.

195
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:45,158
But once I grew up,

196
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,142
I realized how nothing comes naturally...

197
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:50,176
without putting in the effort
to make it work.

198
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:55,279
Mi Rye came to meet me at the network.

199
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,143
She wants to give it a try...

200
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:59,248
but can't out of fear
because of her concern for you.

201
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,654
I don't know what happened before,

202
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,249
but you're living in the past,

203
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,164
and it's dragging your family with you.

204
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:28,503
You haven't gone to work yet?

205
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,600
No, I'm going now.

206
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,830
Why are you coming from there?

207
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,541
I went to Ye Ji's room.

208
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,541
Why?

209
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:40,693
Mi Rye.

210
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,819
Do you want to take that job?

211
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:45,980
What job?

212
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,190
What our neighbor lady offered.
Do you want to?

213
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:53,127
No, I'm not going to.

214
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,208
But you want to.

215
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,958
What? I said no.

216
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,099
My goodness, I'm not interested.

217
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,091
After renting out a perfectly good house,

218
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,435
you're bound to make millions here.

219
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:25,116
Hun doesn't have a future in the country.

220
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:28,331
Maybe I should send him to study in China.

221
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,603
I told you he's not the studying type.

222
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,355
But he has his father's genes.

223
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:34,954
And you're his uncle.

224
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,466
Speaking of which,

225
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:39,177
you haven't taken a public loan, right?

226
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,722
I could pay you back with interest.

227
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:42,585
Are you half asleep?

228
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,502
Snap out of it.

229
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,882
Don't stress about Ye Ji.

230
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,189
Dating is normal at her age.

231
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,250
And just let Mi Rye work.

232
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,615
Drawing pictures in her room at 35,

233
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:59,126
she would end up an old spinster.

234
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:00,864
She should go out to socialize...

235
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,241
and try to mingle with different people.

236
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,386
Nothing will go wrong.

237
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:11,154
I'll get going.

238
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,745
I'll make cold bean noodles for dinner.

239
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,185
I make it even better than Mom.

240
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,384
Why would you wear heels
when your knees hurt?

241
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:29,575
Thanks for your concern,

242
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,826
but how could you possibly
understand a woman?

243
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,815
Wait a minute.

244
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,208
It's about my sister, Mi Rye.

245
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,308
Let's not talk more about that.

246
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:41,379
Pretend it never happened.

247
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,992
That's not what I mean.

248
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,220
I hope you take good care of her.

249
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,554
If your offer still stands.

250
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,732
Then she can start working today.

251
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,231
Would that be okay?

252
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,882
I don't know if she would stick it out,

253
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,322
but trying is what matters right?

254
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:03,786
That's why you should wear
comfortable sneakers.

255
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:06,458
You say one thing,
and then do another about Mi Rye.

256
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,060
Well, don't change your mind again.

257
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:12,081
Okay, I'll send her to work.

258
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:25,998
Joo Yeon, if you sign the papers,

259
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,915
I can make this production happen.

260
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,991
As you can tell by the character,

261
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,879
you can break out of your image...

262
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,143
and even get yourself to Hollywood.

263
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,474
Okay, I'll send my manager.

264
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,820
My word, Producer Gang.

265
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,970
What's this?

266
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,545
What do you think?

267
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:47,359
It's trash that everyone liked but you.

268
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,582
You want to send her to Hollywood,

269
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:51,751
and send me to my grave?

270
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:56,374
You two have a way of being treacherous.

271
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,053
But I guess that's how showbiz works.

272
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,555
That's why I said we should meet outside.

273
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,731
I have nothing to be afraid of.

274
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,477
Anyway, sign the papers. Okay?

275
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:12,372
How did you hurt your leg, Honey?

276
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:14,984
(Love Psychologist, Oh Hye Jin)

277
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,651
The Woori City drama?

278
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,956
Sir.

279
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,733
What's going on?

280
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,887
Do you think I'm a spare or something?

281
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:32,342
What do you mean by spare?

282
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:35,222
Who would think of you in such a way?

283
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,093
You're not a spare tire.

284
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:39,294
If there is a spare, it's me.

285
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:40,765
Isn't that right, sir?

286
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,157
Well, you see...

287
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:45,189
Do you no longer trust me?

288
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,878
Worried the other networks
would steal the project,

289
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm sure you felt uneasy.

290
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,621
Is that why you gave double orders
to Producer Han?

291
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:53,805
- Calm down, first.
- Drink some water.

292
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:56,977
Well, before I could even get started,

293
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:58,785
I got rejected by the writers.

294
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,168
Even actors that I discovered
turned me down.

295
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:02,905
They all rejected me!

296
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:03,905
Are you serious?

297
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:06,972
My goodness, why give it away?

298
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:16,212
The shows that I turned down recently...

299
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:18,157
made it big on cable channels,

300
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:21,209
and they became massive hits.

301
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,572
I know that.

302
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,180
But ever since joining the network,

303
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,332
I've never slipped from the top spot.

304
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:30,117
The ratings hit from 30 to 40 percent
even with full ads.

305
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:33,510
So I won't go down like this.
I'm not dead yet!

306
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,677
I know you're not dead yet.

307
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:37,451
Of course, you're still very much alive.

308
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:40,303
It's not that I can't trust you.

309
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,233
But what if we don't land this deal?

310
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,471
The network's reputation is on the line.

311
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,361
I'm going to make it happen.

312
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,096
To show off to those who are saying
that I'm washed up,

313
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:52,971
I won't lose this project.

314
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:03,498
Chief Ko, you've gotten better at it.

315
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:06,437
Indeed. Have you been practicing
in front of the mirror?

316
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:09,897
Chief Ko, why aren't we overseeing...

317
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:12,129
the project for the Woori City drama?

318
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,529
He's had enough trouble last time...

319
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,593
when we helped with the filming.

320
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:18,377
But with this drama series,

321
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,680
we could promote the city globally.

322
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,649
This time, with TV networks competing,

323
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,161
it's going to be a massive deal.

324
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,739
We have enough work already.

325
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,306
But we're the Regional Tourism Team.

326
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,523
Who would see to it instead?

327
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:33,665
Ms. Han, you just want to see TV stars.

328
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,755
This is offensive touching.

329
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,696
"Offensive touching?"

330
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:42,326
(Wanted: A dedicated part-timer
interested in cuisine)

331
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:57,747
Hello!

Jun Woo, look over there.

00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:06,755
What is it?

335
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,382
This has chickpeas instead of sausages,

336
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:12,726
and it's scrambled tofu
instead of scrambled eggs.

337
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:16,189
They complement the broccoli
with a nice texture.

338
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:18,020
What about this one?

339
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,903
This is zucchini pasta.

340
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,237
What should we do?

341
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:23,121
Just leave her alone.

342
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:25,745
The pasta is made with zucchini.

343
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,322
Although it looks like a salad,

344
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,801
it'll be filling for a long time.

345
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,004
It looks delicious.

346
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:44,994
Hello, Sang Sik.

347
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,844
I'm at the cafe helping Jun Woo
since it's lunchtime.

348
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:53,193
What? The network?

349
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:54,364
Now?

350
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,325
What am I even doing?

351
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,429
This is crazy.

352
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:14,905
Excuse me. What's going on?

353
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:16,402
What happened to my sister-in-law?

354
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:18,688
She's in surgery. Please wait.

355
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:22,895
My word. What's taking Sang Sik so long?

356
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,084
Jun Woo.

357
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,159
What about Sang Sik? Isn't he here?

358
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,012
Sang Sik.

359
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,993
What's happened here?

360
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:41,627
- Sang Sik.
- Let me go.

361
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:42,975
- Sang Sik.
- Sang Sik.

362
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:03,598
What's that you are wearing?
You should look nice.

363
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:05,839
What's wrong with this?

364
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,017
You can manage, right?

365
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,512
I'm not sure about this.

366
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,111
What if I'm making a mistake?

367
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,615
I'll say this again,
don't hold back for my sake.

368
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,711
Just live your life doing what you want.

369
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:24,187
You should give your all at what you want.

370
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:38,680
Are you going on a trip or what?
It's too much.

371
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,895
I need all those things.

372
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:43,116
You are peculiar.

373
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:45,103
I could have taken a bus.

374
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,623
Call me if anything happens,
and be careful.

375
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,572
Are you sending me to a war zone?
I'm not a child.

376
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:52,723
Don't worry, and go.

377
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:54,773
- Ko Sang Sik?
- Okay, you get inside.

378
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,724
I wish you luck.

379
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:16,777
Why does Chief Ko hate dramas so much?

380
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:19,808
I know, it's like he is allergic to them.

381
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:23,329
There must have been a bad history.

382
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,329
Bad history?

383
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:28,053
I think it has to do with
his wife's passing.

384
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,998
They say he has become excessively
responsible since then.

385
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:33,949
I heard he took the civil service exam
after she died.

386
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:36,766
Then what did he do before that?

387
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,565
He wouldn't tell me.

388
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,009
There must be some backstory.

389
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,577
You shouldn't dig into a man's past.

390
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:48,520
The present is what counts.

391
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,686
Welcome aboard, Mi Rye.

392
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:55,805
Let's say hello.

393
00:26:57,114 --> 00:27:00,105
Meet the creator of the webtoon
"I Won't Ever Love,"

394
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,377
- Ko Mi Rye.
- What?

395
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:04,930
Weren't you caught up in
the plagiarism issue?

396
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,955
That's right.

397
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:08,842
Didn't she make Producer Gang suffer
by refusing to drop the case?

398
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:11,722
Why bring up what's old news?

399
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:13,187
At the end of it all,

400
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:16,014
she is the reason why
Producer Gang got demoted.

401
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:17,118
She got demoted?

402
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,011
Aren't you going to say hello?

403
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,881
Hi, I'm Oh Yeong Ae.

404
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:23,662
I'm a producer. Welcome to the team.

405
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,855
I'm new and figuring things out.

406
00:27:25,855 --> 00:27:27,087
I look forward to working with you.

407
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,957
Eagerly waiting to direct this work,

408
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:31,269
I'm Assistant Producer Nam Gi Cheol.

409
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,150
My life depends on your pen.

410
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,158
My life also depends on it.

411
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:36,349
I'll do my best.

412
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:38,494
- Hello.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

413
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,388
I'll work hard.

414
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,580
Here we have Na Ae Ri.

415
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,900
She is an online romance writer.

416
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,300
You'll collaborate with her on the script.

417
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,644
Yes, Ms. Na.

418
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:50,622
Hello, it's an honor.

419
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,124
Aren't you a bit tense right now?

420
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:54,887
Your face says it all.

421
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:57,313
Is this your first visit to a TV station?

422
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:00,305
She has an attitude problem...

423
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,600
and speaks harshly.

424
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,809
I get that you have an attitude.

425
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,613
Don't worry. I don't mind what others say.

426
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:09,650
It's clear we are polar opposites
and spell trouble.

427
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,818
How can you expect collaboration?

428
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,215
I was worried that you might
be someone like me.

429
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:15,994
So it's a relief that you're not.

430
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,115
I'm pleased to meet you.

431
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,440
What's in your suitcase?

432
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,779
This here?

433
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,815
Okay, I'm all set.

434
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:42,180
Shall we start the meeting?

435
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:46,936
This drama mainly focuses on
promoting Woori City.

436
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:49,841
And...

437
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,612
Is there something you need, Chief Ko?

438
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,313
It's not important.

439
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,027
I'll come back later since you're busy.

440
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:16,781
Is anything wrong?

441
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:18,039
No, it's nothing.

442
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:20,271
Do you know Chief Ko?

443
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:25,085
No, he just looks like someone I know,

444
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,806
but I was mistaken.

445
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:31,702
Hurry, get out!

446
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:41,408
Don't ever let go!

447
00:29:58,628 --> 00:30:02,965
I look forward to seeing your pitch.

448
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:03,965
All right.

449
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:23,879
Do you know Chief Ko from earlier?

450
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:27,575
Yes, we have a long history.

451
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:33,127
We should grab a drink and talk it out.

452
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:36,655
Is there some history between you and him?

453
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:42,695
Yes, it's "Paradise for Youth."

454
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:27,639
Have you watched some dramas?

455
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:30,724
I binged on them when I was younger,

456
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,956
but not so much after growing up.

457
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:36,428
But I've watched all the dramas
done by Producer Gang.

458
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,684
Maybe that's why.

459
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,931
There are romcom moments throughout.

460
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,582
- This is fun.
- Really? Let me see.

461
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:44,667
Here.

462
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,058
Then what's your favorite drama?

463
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,315
It's definitely "Paradise for Youth."

464
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:53,132
No, I don't have one.

465
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:56,933
"Paradise for Youth?"

466
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,841
What's the big deal? It's okay.

467
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,521
Producer Han did that one.

468
00:32:03,784 --> 00:32:06,007
Mine is by Producer Gang.

469
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,446
"Lovers' Story" was really enjoyable.

470
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:11,099
It's my all-time favorite.

471
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,814
Okay, let's get started.

472
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:13,814
All right.

473
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,955
I'm counting on your support.

474
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,599
Don't worry.

475
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:28,070
Who do we have here?

476
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:29,927
Ko Sang Sik, isn't it?

477
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:33,716
It's been a while. It's good to see you.

478
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,707
What brings you here?

479
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,894
Why? I'm here for the city drama.

480
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:45,250
You should've kept in touch
if you worked here.

481
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,431
Have you been doing well?

482
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:50,540
Yes, I'm good.

483
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,703
Your boss went to my high school.

484
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,755
I see.

485
00:32:56,755 --> 00:33:00,611
My word, I didn't know you were
once a drama producer.

486
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,591
He was my assistant.

487
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:07,103
Anyway, I'm glad you're doing well.

488
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:09,091
Civil service is the best.

489
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,384
It's a good thing that you quit.

490
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:13,054
Producing dramas...

491
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:15,729
That gets harder as years go on.

492
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:18,824
I'm pitching for Woori City drama,
so please help me out.

493
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:21,241
We'll run into each other often.

494
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:22,483
Isn't that right, Director Shin?

495
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:25,217
I'll be off then.

496
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:41,008
Does he think he's some popular star?

497
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:44,290
Always taking photos with young girls.

498
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,064
Sorry.

499
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:50,593
Sorry for being late.

500
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:55,055
Why are you getting up? I just came.

501
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:56,340
An iced latte, please.

502
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,116
Take a seat.

503
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,891
Hand it over.

504
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,512
What's all the rush?

505
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,079
I haven't been able to work all this time.

506
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,076
You'd know that if you saw my phone.

507
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,771
I have no idea because it's been off.

508
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:16,848
You had my phone in the meantime,

509
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,312
so what's all the fuss?

510
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:27,054
My word.

511
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,548
Hand it over now.

512
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,456
Well, come on.

513
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:36,142
Here it is.

514
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,327
My word.

515
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,607
Are you saying you don't know...

516
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,952
who I am or what I do for a living?

517
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:43,880
You have to be fully dressed
from head to toe...

518
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,792
before you leave the house.

519
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,224
If there is a pimple on your face,

520
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:49,609
you get stressed all day.

521
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:53,954
I can tell with a woman like you.

522
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,348
Woman?

523
00:34:57,496 --> 00:35:00,448
Sure, I'm a woman, but...

524
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,313
And you're a nagger.

525
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:05,581
You act tough but feel empty inside,

526
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:06,710
feeling lonesome.

527
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,242
If you loosen up a little bit,
life would be different.

528
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,626
So it's a pity.

529
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:14,471
I'm off.

530
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,019
What is with him?

531
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:23,914
Did that Casanova just turn me down?

532
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:32,003
"Woman?"

533
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,120
Enduring a live shoot on the drama set...

534
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,387
is nothing new here.

535
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:44,715
Be thankful for no accidents.

536
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:49,593
What about "Paradise for Youth" on KBN?

537
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:51,543
Why bring that up again?

538
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:54,239
There are rumors it wasn't an accident.

539
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,583
Are you saying it was a man-made one?

540
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,495
There was an electrical overload,

541
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:01,232
and a fire broke out at the time.

542
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:03,952
That's how it was reported in the news.

543
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:06,166
How can you trust everything in the media?

544
00:36:07,169 --> 00:36:09,625
I heard someone died in the fire,

545
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,257
but nobody was held accountable.

546
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:12,338
Really?

547
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,064
Producer Han, you directed it.

548
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,628
I wasn't there at the scene,
but my assistant was.

549
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:21,406
Then did he take responsibility?

550
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:22,442
Of course.

551
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:26,125
It's the assistant's responsibility
without the producer there.

552
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,228
So, handle your job well.

553
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,248
- Okay.
- Okay.

554
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,850
It wasn't my brother.

555
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:34,611
It wasn't my brother's fault.

556
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,255
Boss, where are you going?

557
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,620
I'll go if it's a delivery.

558
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:56,441
Jun, are you going to that woman?

559
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,376
You'd better be gone when I return.

560
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:06,362
I'm sorry. I mean it.

561
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,873
I've caused all sorts of trouble
to call you every time.

562
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:10,931
I'm sorry about all that.

563
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:14,272
I came to Korea wanting to see you.

564
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:16,144
But since you wouldn't see me,

565
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:18,201
I couldn't think of anything else.

566
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,579
- I'm really sorry.
- Stop it.

567
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,691
If you like someone, date her.

568
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,391
If you love someone, marry her.

569
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:25,901
I'll just be your friend.

570
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,457
You can think of me as some
random girl you know.

571
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,750
"Some random girl I know?"

572
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:33,817
Then why is she standing here...

573
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,989
and apologizing like this?

574
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:40,562
I'll be leaving in a month.

575
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,821
So I want to apologize to you...

576
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,871
and sort out my feelings.

577
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,910
Help me do that by your side.

578
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,292
Please.

579
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,920
In case anything happens to Mi Rye,

580
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,227
please contact me.

581
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:17,676
Did he send her to kindergarten or what?

582
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,929
We're working in a small office together.

583
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,097
What could possibly happen?

584
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:26,107
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

585
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:33,393
You were in here?

586
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,393
It seems you're hurt pretty bad.

587
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:36,930
I'm all right.

588
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,881
No, let's get you to a doctor.

589
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,057
How did you get hurt?

590
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:41,730
I tripped after having drinks.

591
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,386
It's just cuts and bruises.

592
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:44,558
Good grief.

593
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,490
Boss, are you in there?

594
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,578
Yes, what's wrong?

595
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,932
Are you with Ms. Ko?

596
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,837
What? No, she's not here.

597
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:57,616
Ms. Ko disappeared.

598
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,692
While we were out getting coffee,

599
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,888
she left with her belongings.

600
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:05,814
What did you say?

601
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,860
What happened in that short time?

602
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,150
I don't know. Nothing happened.

603
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
She won't even pick up.

604
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,828
- Call her again.
- Okay.

605
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,225
You should just stay put.

606
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:28,825
I'm okay. Just go quickly.

607
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,948
My word.

608
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:36,550
That's good to know. I trust you.

609
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,013
Take care.

610
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:40,206
Where could she have gone?

611
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:45,960
Min Ju, can you talk now?

612
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,828
I'm on my way to deliver your lunch.

613
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:51,017
It's a surprise, so don't tell Mi Rye.

614
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:01,564
Did she already take off in a cab?

615
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,397
I can't make of her character.

616
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:05,891
- You sure nothing happened?
- I swear.

617
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,281
But why should we look for her
when she ran away?

618
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,461
We're in trouble if we do not.

619
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,506
Do you want to direct when you retire?

620
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:15,210
I'll check here, you check the other side.

621
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,282
Okay.

622
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:17,283
Ms. Ko!

623
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,912
Min Ju, what happened to your leg?

624
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:27,034
It's nothing.

625
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,969
Did you see Mi Rye anywhere?

626
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:29,979
Mi Rye?

627
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:38,657
There she is.

628
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:40,991
Where is she going?

629
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,280
Min Ju, are you okay?

630
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,886
What is her injury, and how bad is it?

631
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,415
It's chondromalacia in the knee.

632
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:03,125
Chondromalacia?

633
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,858
It's a common case with middle-aged
women with menopause.

634
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:09,027
If you look at your cartilage here,

635
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:11,882
it's softened, weak, and damaged.

636
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:14,265
I suggest getting admitted for treatment.

637
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,721
This can't be that serious.

638
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,114
Just get admitted for treatment.

639
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:20,880
With even signs of osteoporosis,

640
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,992
you might need surgery if it worsens.

641
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:32,183
Mi Rye isn't answering.

642
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,727
She's not picking up.

643
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,111
You should stop worrying and get treated.

644
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:41,823
This is such a terrible mess.

645
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:43,591
Why won't you get admitted?

646
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,312
Now isn't the right time.

647
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,195
Hello, did you hear from Mi Rye?

648
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:54,724
No, she won't answer and isn't anywhere.

649
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:56,309
Boss, where are you?

650
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,810
I'm at the hospital.

651
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,942
The hospital?

652
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:04,092
Hello.

653
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:09,940
What's up, Jun Woo?

654
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,437
Bro, did Mi Rye call you?

655
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:14,374
No. Why do you ask?

656
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:17,445
Mi Rye ran away from the network.

657
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:19,195
What?

658
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,127
She was leaving when I went to visit.

659
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:25,531
I can't believe they didn't contact me.

660
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:26,732
So where are you now?

661
00:42:26,732 --> 00:42:30,348
Min Ju got in an accident looking for her.

662
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,574
We're at the ER.

663
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,432
You're at the ER?

664
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,734
I'll look for Mi Rye, so just rest.

665
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:41,507
I can't be here when she's gone missing.

666
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,371
Don't overwork yourself, but lie down.

667
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,028
- Okay.
- Thank you.

668
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:49,730
You heard the nurse, right?

669
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,193
I can't believe all this mess.

670
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:54,017
Now I look like a sick person.

671
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:56,509
What's wrong with that?
You look even sexier.

672
00:42:57,392 --> 00:42:58,699
Are you teasing me now?

673
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:01,293
Were you embarrassed in front of me?

674
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:04,033
No, I was humiliated.

675
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:06,133
I like this honest side of you.

676
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:09,417
Anyway, it's already past dinner.

677
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,425
Aren't you hungry?

678
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:11,857
I'm okay. You should go.

679
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:13,817
How can I leave you here alone?

680
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:16,033
There isn't anyone to care for you.

681
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:19,337
Before moving, I even took
an ambulance by myself.

682
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:21,533
So this is nothing.

683
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,544
Wait a minute.

684
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:32,846
Sang Sik, where are you?

685
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:34,216
What's taking you so long?

686
00:43:36,095 --> 00:43:38,057
Your wife got into an accident.

687
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,594
She's now in surgery.

688
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:15,491
- My word.
- Sang Sik.

689
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:20,400
You must have been worried.

690
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,768
I told you it wasn't serious.

691
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:24,560
How badly hurt are you to get admitted?

692
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,481
Well... It's chondromalacia in my knee.

693
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:30,729
My cartilage has become weak.

694
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:34,549
That's obvious at our age.

695
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,772
Once over 40, aging makes
our cartilage wear out.

696
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,345
Don't you know that we can't
recover as quickly as before?

697
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:42,286
Aging?

698
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:43,821
You were hurt and limping,

699
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,294
so why even run around?

700
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:46,574
She was looking for Mi Rye.

701
00:44:46,574 --> 00:44:47,837
You stay out of this.

702
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:49,693
Are you here to lecture me?

703
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:55,074
And what happened to Mi Rye?

704
00:44:55,074 --> 00:44:57,810
Didn't you say she was doing well?

705
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,979
There wasn't any problem when we texted.

706
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:01,322
And the meeting went well.

707
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,372
But when I left for the bathroom...

708
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:06,787
Min Ju isn't at fault here.

709
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,314
Mi Rye just couldn't handle it.

710
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:09,984
Why would Mi Rye even leave?

711
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,863
The network is just that terrible.

712
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:13,470
What did you say?

713
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,812
You promised nothing would go wrong.

714
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:18,719
So why would my sister pack up
and leave suddenly?

715
00:45:20,983 --> 00:45:22,118
It's Mi Rye.

716
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:23,200
Be quiet.

717
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:29,205
Mi Rye, what happened?

718
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:30,491
Where are you?

719
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:33,143
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:36,763
I should've been more thoughtful
before deciding on it.

721
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,911
I'm sorry for causing everyone trouble.

722
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:42,933
The people on our team may be blunt,

723
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:45,018
but they are good people.

724
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,040
So where are you now?

725
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,643
Everyone is worried about you.

726
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,826
No, be quiet, Honey.

727
00:45:54,256 --> 00:45:55,367
Honey?

728
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:57,818
Who are you with now?

729
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:04,127
If it's hard getting along with everyone,

730
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:06,551
there are many other ways
to work together.

731
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:08,537
So don't be so hasty. My word...

732
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:10,511
Hello?

733
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,522
Hello, where are you right now?

734
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:18,031
Hello?

735
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,370
Mi Rye. Ko Mi Rye!

736
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,033
Good heavens.

737
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:24,224
Why would you snatch it away
when I was talking?

738
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:26,049
Where is she? Who is she with?

739
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,108
She just apologized
and didn't say where she is.

740
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:30,460
Who is Honey?

741
00:46:33,345 --> 00:46:36,122
What on Earth did your team do to her...

742
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:37,684
to make her pack up and leave?

743
00:46:37,684 --> 00:46:39,592
Are you blaming this on my team?

744
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:41,456
Why else would she disappear?

745
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:43,297
Did you send Mi Rye to kindergarten
or what?

746
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:45,519
Do you expect me to watch her all day?

747
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,856
That's why I especially asked you
to take care of her.

748
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:51,915
Good heavens, please stop it. Both of you.

749
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:54,875
- My knee hurts.
- Min Ju.

750
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,598
Don't worry about Mi Rye, and take care.

751
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:07,772
You stay here and look after her.

752
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,285
Are you leaving?

753
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,525
She just apologized
and didn't say where she is.

754
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,684
Who is Honey?

755
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:29,130
Honey?

756
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,875
You need to take these pills regularly.

757
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:42,247
Okay, you can go now.

758
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:44,215
Why are you telling me to leave?

759
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:46,336
I'm going to stay here overnight.

760
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,965
- What?
- Why not?

761
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,930
I'm used to being alone and prefer it.

762
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,202
You can go home.

763
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:57,435
But it's a shame to leave,

764
00:47:57,435 --> 00:47:58,669
and I'm worried.

765
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:01,283
My friends will stop by my house...

766
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,764
and bring me clothes and supplies I need.

767
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:05,186
So you don't have to worry.

768
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:07,435
Are they from the housewarming party?

769
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:10,556
That's right, and if you hear from Mi Rye,

770
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:12,021
let me know right away.

771
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:13,220
Don't worry.

772
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,193
I'll catch her and bring her to you.

773
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:21,560
Thanks, Jun Woo.

774
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,763
No worries.

775
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,591
I'm forced to take my vacation,

776
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,831
although I got an earful from Chief Ko.

777
00:48:30,831 --> 00:48:34,503
Don't take what he said to heart.

778
00:48:34,503 --> 00:48:37,090
He's quite sensitive
when it comes to family.

779
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,983
I heard from Mi Rye that...

780
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,928
something bad went down with the network.

781
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:46,292
What in the world happened?

782
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:52,571
Well, there was an accident.

783
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:56,162
He lost his wife that day.

784
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,145
Goodness me, I see.

785
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,058
No wonder he gets sensitive.

786
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:07,118
I know where Mi Rye can be found,

787
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,569
so don't worry too much.

788
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:11,473
Where would that be?

789
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:22,049
I shouldn't have gone near the network.

790
00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:23,097
Right?

791
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,047
You went there again, right?

792
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:36,993
I know where you are, so wait there.

793
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:41,129
If you know, just leave me alone.

794
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:44,528
Ko Mi Rye.

795
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:48,418
Come over here.

796
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,525
Sang Sik.

797
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:51,665
I'll break your legs into halves.

798
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:54,658
I said we can talk later. Why come here?

799
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,018
Do you even know how worried
and troubled people are?

800
00:49:58,018 --> 00:50:00,517
You're dead when I catch you.

801
00:50:00,517 --> 00:50:01,711
Come here.

802
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:03,639
Wait, don't run away.

803
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,883
Wait. Wait.

804
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:10,402
Stop. Just wait till I catch you.

805
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:12,855
You, wait. That's dangerous.

806
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:19,390
I told you to stop.

807
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:20,900
Wait.

808
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,232
Stop following me.

809
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,320
- I said stop.
- Go away.

810
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,324
Wait till I catch you.

811
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:29,531
That's dangerous!

812
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:31,496
Stop right there. Stop.

813
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:34,325
Stop. Get down.

814
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,474
Don't come this way!

815
00:50:37,878 --> 00:50:38,963
Stop now!

816
00:50:58,463 --> 00:50:59,521
Are you okay?

817
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,623
Here.

818
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:13,551
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

819
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,182
Does this look okay to you?

820
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:17,084
You could have even killed her.

821
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,147
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

822
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:24,195
It's okay. Don't be hard on her.

823
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:26,419
How can I not be hard on her?

824
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:28,499
She's too much for me to handle.

825
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:30,358
I said I'm sorry.

826
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:34,422
Why did you run from the network?

827
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:40,195
I'm sure she had her reasons.

828
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:43,150
Just because.

829
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,330
Just because?

830
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:48,362
Mi Rye, be honest with me.

831
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:51,051
Only then I can do something about it.

832
00:51:54,163 --> 00:51:58,065
The team stepped out for some coffee,

833
00:51:58,065 --> 00:52:00,709
so I went to the lounge.

834
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:04,077
So that's who you are.

835
00:52:05,284 --> 00:52:07,738
Your brother is Ko Sang Sik?

836
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:09,863
It's Chief Ko from Woori City Hall.

837
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:13,426
I guess it runs in the family.

838
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:15,259
You work here like he did.

839
00:52:15,985 --> 00:52:17,850
Do you know my brother well?

840
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,833
Yes, of course.

841
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,915
Just tell him to take it easy.

842
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:26,610
There is no need to feel guilty
about what happened.

843
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,073
It wasn't my brother's fault!

844
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:31,962
Yes, it was an accident.

845
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,228
Just a mere accident.

846
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:39,373
Mi Rye.

847
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,939
- Mi Rye?
- Yes.

848
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:45,555
What on Earth happened to you?

849
00:52:45,894 --> 00:52:48,337
Did you meet someone there?

850
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,302
No.

851
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:53,486
I mean, there were people there,

852
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:57,544
and they were saying how tough
it was to make dramas.

853
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:01,890
So I suddenly became so scared.

854
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,851
Take your time with that.

855
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,365
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

856
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,996
Are you sure about quitting work?

857
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,926
It's not something that I can handle.

858
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:43,730
Look there.

859
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,794
The foal won't leave its mother's side.

860
00:53:47,794 --> 00:53:49,707
That's Honey.

861
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:52,788
I haven't come here in a while,
and she's had a baby.

862
00:53:52,788 --> 00:53:53,878
Isn't it pretty?

863
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:55,510
Indeed.

864
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:01,790
Mi Rye.

865
00:54:02,482 --> 00:54:03,482
Yes?

866
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:09,791
Everyone needs help at first.

867
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:12,510
Did Honey run well from the start?

868
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:16,525
Nobody can run from the get-go.

869
00:54:18,426 --> 00:54:23,863
I was also scared and struggled at first.

870
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,867
Though my dream was coming true,

871
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,436
I wondered if I could keep going...

872
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,196
or whether it was right for me.

873
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:38,509
Why?

874
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,784
Starting out at the network,

875
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:49,503
I was excited about having made it.

876
00:54:56,437 --> 00:54:58,318
Then I lost someone I love.

877
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,717
We were to even get married.

878
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:10,604
Since I was only an assistant,

879
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:12,397
there wasn't any free time.

880
00:55:15,226 --> 00:55:17,734
So I missed his last moment.

881
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:22,155
I wasn't sure if this was for me,

882
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:25,019
or what I was even working for.

883
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:27,613
So I went to drama shoots in tears...

884
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,302
and to the editing room sobbing.

885
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,285
I wanted to run myself,

886
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:38,827
but there was nowhere to go.

887
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:42,317
That's how I have come this far.

888
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:47,427
I didn't know you had such a past.

889
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:52,343
You can be scared and want to escape.

890
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:55,026
I've been through what you are feeling.

891
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:58,712
But there was nowhere to run,

892
00:55:58,712 --> 00:56:00,929
and I lacked the courage to quit.

893
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:03,984
So Mi Rye,

894
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:06,254
you are allowed to be afraid.

895
00:56:06,254 --> 00:56:08,604
I won't tell you not to be so,
because it's okay.

896
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:10,392
That's only natural.

897
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,091
But remember,

898
00:56:19,802 --> 00:56:23,121
there is someone right here
who understands...

899
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:26,840
what you're feeling right now.

900
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:37,708
Are you crying?

901
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,415
No, I'm sweating.

902
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,624
It's hot.

903
00:56:42,624 --> 00:56:46,955
You can always share your fears
and struggles with me.

904
00:56:46,955 --> 00:56:49,309
Before being a drama producer,

905
00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:52,547
I'm your neighbor lady next door.

906
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:59,364
Yes, thank you for sharing.

907
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,740
I hope you take care.

908
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:28,404
I can't believe you won't come.

909
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:31,445
Take your time and come back
when you feel better.

910
00:57:33,134 --> 00:57:34,517
Good grief.

911
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,610
Sang Sik.

912
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:37,880
Yes?

913
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:49,407
I'm sorry.

914
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:51,145
For making you worry.

915
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,896
I'm okay if you are.

916
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:01,361
Then are you okay?

917
00:58:03,552 --> 00:58:04,552
Of course.

918
00:58:11,813 --> 00:58:12,969
You brat.

919
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,446
Then I lost someone I love.

920
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:34,510
We were to get married.

921
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:50,927
All he did was work hard,
but it cost his life!

922
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:52,839
- You killed him!
- Mom.

923
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,339
- You killed him!
- Stop it.

924
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:57,175
Tell him to come out!

925
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:02,129
How could this happen?

926
01:00:02,129 --> 01:00:05,197
How could this happen to my son?

927
01:00:57,342 --> 01:00:58,961
I'm sorry in many ways.

928
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:04,414
I was too certain about everything...

929
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,575
when I didn't realize Mi Rye was gone.

930
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:08,302
That's on me.

931
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:09,774
How is your knee?

932
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:13,128
I hope it didn't get worse
when you fell over.

933
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,829
That was a scare, but I'm okay.

934
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:18,369
What?

935
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,589
Did you get hurt?

936
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,095
No, it's just a scrape.

937
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:26,407
More than that,

938
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:33,009
I ended up hearing what you told Mi Rye.

939
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:36,846
You did?

940
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:41,069
Goodness me, it's all in the past.

941
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:42,200
It's okay.

942
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,462
It must have been tough.

943
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:54,342
When you lose someone
who is closest to you,

944
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:58,470
it's hard to endure each day.

945
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:04,864
I also heard that you...

946
01:02:08,482 --> 01:02:11,153
It's like yesterday that I lost my wife.

947
01:02:16,508 --> 01:02:18,563
Well, anyway,

948
01:02:18,563 --> 01:02:22,349
you looked out for Mi Rye today.

949
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:23,652
I'm very grateful.

950
01:02:25,902 --> 01:02:28,028
Are you getting discharged tomorrow?

951
01:02:28,028 --> 01:02:29,469
Yes.

952
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:30,991
Then let's go back in.

953
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:35,025
Wait a minute.

954
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:44,589
You just know things as an adult.

955
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:47,556
And I know what this man is feeling...

956
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,413
even without a stethoscope.

957
01:02:52,091 --> 01:02:55,380
There is still much unknown,
even as an adult.

958
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,603
What this woman has to say to me...

959
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:01,198
is completely unexpected.

960
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:11,333
Ko Sang Sik.

961
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:17,627
Do you...

962
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,693
have feelings for me?

963
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:53,988
(Second to Last Love)

964
01:03:53,988 --> 01:03:55,700
Am I the only one who remembers?

965
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,334
We were in this room...

966
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,622
When I start to have feelings,

967
01:03:58,622 --> 01:04:00,847
I want to show them with all my heart.

968
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:02,841
Ye Ji was with a boy on the street,

969
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,449
and they kissed...

970
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:08,447
Why didn't you tell me this before?

971
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,814
Isn't it supposed to get easier with age?

972
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:12,424
You should know right away...

973
01:04:12,424 --> 01:04:14,893
whether you're right for each other
or not.

974
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:15,893
