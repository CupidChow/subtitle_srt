1
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:07,857
I'm dating someone now.

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:16,042
I felt like I should tell you.

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,258
I see.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,337
That's good.

5
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,638
Then...

6
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,312
I'll get going.

7
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,206
Wait.

8
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,631
This here.

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,688
It's exactly like mine.

10
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:02,887
That can't be.

11
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,855
Mine has "SS" marked on it.

12
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:20,118
I lost someone I love.

13
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:23,918
We were to even get married.

14
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:28,779
No!

15
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,133
No!

16
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,191
- Sang Sik.
- Don't let go!

17
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,101
Don't let go!

18
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:00,198
What's wrong?

19
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,877
It's nothing.

20
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:10,340
Where did you get this?

21
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,668
My wife gave it to me.

22
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,220
Is that right?

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,689
Then it must be something similar.

24
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:21,694
Right.

25
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,979
Did you have something to say to me?

26
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,959
No, it's nothing.

27
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:30,931
I see.

28
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,049
The bracelet brings luck.

29
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,769
Now, only good things will happen.

30
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,081
Of course.

31
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,277
Sang Sik, Hee Su. How pretty.

32
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,161
Whatever this is,

33
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,630
Eun Ho...

34
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:31,014
had it tightly grasped in his hand.

35
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:50,050
(Second to Last Love)

36
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:53,027
(Episode 9)

37
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:59,518
How about we sit for a bit?

38
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,041
- Do you want to?
- Yes.

39
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,718
As a kid, I used to hang out
here with friends.

40
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,671
It must be filled with memories.

41
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,776
But I hated this place.

42
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:19,025
Why?

43
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:23,270
When the sun started setting
while we played,

44
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,399
Mother would come along...

45
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,451
and take my friends home for dinner.

46
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,531
I couldn't help but feel jealous.

47
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,999
Being left here alone,

48
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:41,258
I didn't get why my parents were
always busy and fighting.

49
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,212
There was a lot of resentment.

50
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,449
That's when I decided.

51
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:52,098
To cook delicious food for everyone.

52
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:57,266
I wanted to treat people who are alone.

53
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,361
So when I moved here...

54
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,666
Food is more about love than taste.

55
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,776
Sang Sik, are you heading out?

56
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:12,875
Yes.

57
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,604
Good morning.

58
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,819
It's nice to see you two exercise.

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,243
I've wanted to work out since moving here.

60
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:22,586
Now I'm finally doing it.

61
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,736
I took her to our jogging place.

62
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,960
She loved it.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,486
It's a great place with a nice view.

64
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:31,460
Yes, it was very lovely.

65
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,564
The spring water was so cool.

66
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,590
I see.

67
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,236
I'd better get to work.

68
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,755
Okay, I'll see you later.

69
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,890
All right.

70
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,454
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

71
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,482
- Aren't you hot?
- No.

72
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,115
Gang Min Ju, please don't be...

73
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,422
who I think you might be.

74
00:05:56,787 --> 00:06:00,608
I hope this bad feeling is wrong.

75
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,068
Wait, let me see your phone.

76
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,622
- My phone?
- Yes.

77
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:15,341
(Park Jun Woo)

78
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,445
Did you put me down as Park Jun Woo?

79
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:18,677
Then what should your name be?

80
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,550
Give it some thought and change it.

81
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,605
I'll check later.

82
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,166
My number is on speed dial one,

83
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,805
so hit that if you need me.

84
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,745
From now on, I'm your top priority.

85
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:32,689
You should get inside.

86
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,690
- See you later.
- Okay.

87

(Chief Ko's Day in Woori City)

88
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,460
This is a huge hit.

89
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,114
Look at the views on YouTube.

90
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,484
Chief Ko has become a star.

91
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:59,155
Ms. Han, when did you manage
to edit his photos for uploading?

92
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:03,115
I took snapshots while at work
and at various events.

93
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,460
Who knew they would blow up like this?

94
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,178
Messing up the dance made it popular.

95
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,467
It wouldn't be this huge
if he had did it perfectly.

96
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,666
"The flaws make him real."

97
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,267
"Keep up the good work."

98
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,588
"The mistakes make him cool."

99
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:20,507
All the comments are compliments.

100
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:24,013
They have an eye for true excellence.

101
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,363
Regional Tourism Team.

102
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:29,763
Excellent work.

103
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,148
Bravo!

104
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,050
Your promotional video has gone viral...

105
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,394
and was even featured on the news.

106
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:41,187
Now we're seeing more tourists...

107
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:43,705
and our marketplaces are bouncing back.

108
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,499
And I have another surprise for you.

109
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,720
Starting today,
you will take an active role...

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,738
in the Woori City Drama project.

111
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,463
In the drama project?

112
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:58,417
Does that mean we can get involved?

113
00:07:58,417 --> 00:07:59,906
Absolutely.

114
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,042
Along with Director Shin,

115
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:06,101
you'll handle everything from planning
to production and promotion.

116
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:09,929
As you know, this project is massive...

117
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,684
and we need extra hands.

118
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,218
So I consulted the Deputy Mayor.

119
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,177
And given your latest achievement,

120
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,009
we decided to have you on board.

121
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,114
I'm counting on you.

122
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,468
Deputy Mayor.

123
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,388
Chief Ko, I need to speak to you.

124
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,037
Please come to my office.

125
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,247
Keep up the good work.

126
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,000
My goodness.

127
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,109
What in the world are you doing?

128
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,238
Why don't you just run me over?

129
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:06,238
What?

130
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,748
You might be momentary interest for you,

131
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,165
but Jun is everything to me.

132
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,491
If I die because of you,

133
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,747
you'll be haunted by guilt,

134
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,917
and Jun won't ever forget me.

135
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,285
Have you lost your mind?

136
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,939
I want to be remembered that desperately,

137
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:23,939
but you wouldn't know.

138
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,786
- Listen, Min Ji Seon.
- Of course not.

139
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:29,524
You wouldn't know without suffering
any loss.

140
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,257
I've been there.

141
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,103
It was hard losing someone I love...

142
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,670
and I wanted to perish with him.

143
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:54,070
You're still young to risk all for love.

144
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,732
- What?
- Losing a loved one...

145
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,332
seems to unhinge you at first.

146
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,455
The agony makes you wish for death.

147
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:08,301
But after a while, you eat again...

148
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,456
and you find yourself laughing.

149
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,582
Life carries on like this.

150
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,072
In life, you may even find someone new.

151
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,030
But there is nothing in death.

152
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,174
So don't behave like this.

153
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:37,950
Don't throw away your life.

154
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:43,007
This is really foolish.

155
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,266
I want to be remembered that desperately,

156
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,468
but you wouldn't know.

157
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:34,241
You wouldn't know without suffering
any loss.

158
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,449
Don't look at the time.

159
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,362
But always live in the moment.

160
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:01,411
All right?

161
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:44,238
(Ko Sang Sik's Resume)

162
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,402
You worked as a producer with a network.

163
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,958
For the Woori City Drama project,

164
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,253
that makes you the best candidate.

165
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:52,733
After joining a broadcaster,

166
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,917
I was a mere assistant for a few years.

167
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,678
Well, given your university major,

168
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:00,236
it's a not-so-unrelated experience.

169
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:04,389
So you can handle the selection process.

170
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,025
I trust that you'll oversee it fairly.

171
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,080
Since that day,

172
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,510
I've been running away from what happened.

173
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:20,354
It's exactly like mine.

174
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,399
But it seems an invisible thread binds me.

175
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:31,248
Have I reached a dead-end with no escape?

176
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:44,061
The star Na Joo Yeon is our main lead.

177
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:46,781
With a rookie's fresh new idea,

178
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,294
we got an A-list writer for the script.

179
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,341
- And I'll be directing.
- Good.

180
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,638
- What about Producer Gang?
- Here.

181
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,944
Let's see here.

182
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:00,488
You're working with a pre-debut writer...

183
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:03,642
and an unknown webtoon artist?

184
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,707
Moreover, Nam Gi Cheol is directing?

185
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,738
How is this supposed to work?

186
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,362
We're going to meet with Woori City...

187
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,053
and break down what they want.

188
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,905
If this fails, I'm breaking up your team.

189
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,872
You will get reassigned or transferred.

190
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:20,696
To drag us down even more?

191
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:21,881
That won't happen.

192
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,667
Let's hope that it doesn't.

193
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,376
Will your ragtag team pull it off?

194
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:34,088
You won't know if we're a ragtag team
or the Avengers...

195
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,627
until we battle it out.

196
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:37,712
I should head down to Woori City.

197
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,873
Mind if I check out your new place?

198
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,079
I don't think you should visit.

199
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,095
Why not? We're good friends.

200
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,830
Are you acting this way again...

201
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,135
just because you are married?

202
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,567
She has a boyfriend.

203
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,016
A boyfriend? Who?

204
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:56,275
He lives next door.

205
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,161
What? Next door?

206
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,855
Jun, don't you feel anything for me?

207
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:10,971
Don't you care about me?

208
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,878
No.

209
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:17,082
Then why were you so nice in Canada?

210
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,975
- That's because...
- Was it pity?

211
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,956
With my parents arguing nonstop,

212
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,633
did you think I was lost?

213
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:28,464
Back then,

214
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,368
you seemed to be like me.

215
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,423
Being all alone in a deserted playground,

216
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:42,127
I saw my lonely self in you.

217
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,854
Jun.

218
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:50,892
And you liked the food I made.

219
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,142
I was grateful to be appreciated.

220
00:15:55,418 --> 00:16:00,467
So I wasn't being nice out of pity.

221
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,348
It was for my own sake.

222
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:04,421
There wasn't any sympathy involved.

223
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,782
I was only comforting myself.

224
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,422
I'm selfish, right?

225
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,756
That's fine.

226
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:17,604
Two lonely souls can live together.

227
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,795
No.

228
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,700
I can't bear looking at you.

229
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:25,841
You cling to me saying it's love...

230
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:27,516
and constantly need my care.

231
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,482
It's dreadful, like seeing my mother.

232
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:33,988
Jun.

233
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:36,610
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:41,663
I hope you move on and live well.

235
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:42,882
I truly mean that.

236
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,534
Are you considering marrying Jun Woo?

237
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:00,665
What? I haven't given it a thought.

238
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,211
Then that's all you feel for him.

239
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,276
Honestly, I don't know.

240
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,125
I'm not sure how much I like him,

241
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,051
or even if these feelings are real.

242
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,020
Are you kidding me?

243
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,140
To figure out if you like a guy or not,

244
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,963
imagine lying in bed with him.

245
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,194
If you can't do that, he's off the table.

246
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,739
If you feel thrilled, he's a catch.

247
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,253
Can you see yourself in bed with Jun Woo?

248
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:34,339
I don't know. That's shameless.

249
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,710
This isn't adultery.

250
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,175
Some people might think it's wrong.

251
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,591
Look, men openly date and marry women...

252
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:44,360
who are even 20 years younger.

253
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,767
So why not women?

254
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,702
That's social bias.

255
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:50,494
It's somewhat overwhelming.

256
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,447
I have reservations about him.

257
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,918
Along with the age difference,

258
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,620
there is an ex-girlfriend tucked away.

259
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,507
That makes me uneasy about him.

260
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,595
Who doesn't have a past?

261
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,646
If it's sorted, younger men are great.

262
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,725
I want anyone who isn't younger.

263
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,991
Young guys are so vigorous.

264
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,628
That's exhausting.

265
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,853
Look at her hands shaking.

266
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:13,309
I'd obviously age and end up single,

267
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,221
so why even start dating him?

268
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,776
It would feel like walking
in killer heels.

269
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,727
I'm not so sure myself.

270
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,535
For marriage and dating,

271
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,742
I prefer guys who are like sneakers.

272
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:27,374
Someone I can chat with, like a friend.

273
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:31,326
And to lean on sometimes.
Where is that guy?

274
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,966
Enough of that.

275
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:35,702
Women still need that spark.

276
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:39,390
Romance is what keeps us alive.

277
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,390
Don't you agree?

278
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,463
Who can say for sure? Let's drink.

279
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,855
If you're unsure, let me have him.

280
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,465
What? There is no giving up on love.

281
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,881
Cheers.

282
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,468
So you're going to let Jun Woo have her?

283
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:59,499
That's not what this is.

284
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:02,259
She's lost someone she loved before,

285
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:03,826
which must have been unbearable.

286
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,522
I know it all too well.

287
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,195
No shock there.

288
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,786
Now that she's with Jun Woo,

289
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:12,348
I really hope that things work out.

290
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,702
Are you guilty about something?

291
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:20,147
Yes.

292
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:22,660
I think so.

293
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,685
But then,

294
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,252
if this bad feeling turns out to be true,

295
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:31,766
I couldn't live through it.

296
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,368
I'd feel terrible for her.

297
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,731
There is definitely something going on.

298
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:40,852
Anyway, she decided to give
Jun Woo a chance.

299
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,948
That was hard enough,
so I'd rather not get in the way.

300
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:47,052
You know when people are annoying?

301
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,523
When they pretend to be okay,
important, and caring.

302
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,948
Pretending to be grown up!

303
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,421
It's all that pretending!

304
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:56,526
You're spitting again. Seriously?

305
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:04,334
Sir, can't you sell just one of these?

306
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:08,100
No, they're all bundled at the moment.

307
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,364
This is too much for just myself.

308
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,581
You recently moved here, right?

309
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:14,488
You live alone next to Chief Ko's place,
don't you?

310
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,899
Yes, living alone is common now.

311
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,572
I don't know why they sell in bulks.

312
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:21,591
- Should I leave this out?
- No, I'll take it.

313
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,935
Sweetie!

314
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,858
What's the matter?

315
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,741
Sweetie, why are you outside?

316
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,420
Who is that? Was he following you?

317
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,659
Hurry, just walk me home.

318
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:25,913
There have been more visitors lately,

319
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,321
but it's usually not like that.

320
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,712
You look frightened, and even sweaty.

321
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,956
Thank you.

322
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,959
Why are you wearing so little?

323
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,795
Were you headed somewhere? I'm sorry.

324
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,475
- My goodness.
- Sang Sik.

325
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,336
What's going on?

326
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,404
- Min Ju.
- Jun Woo.

327
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,601
A strange guy was tailing her.

328
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:54,697
What strange guy?

329
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:58,317
Don't worry about it. I'm okay.

330
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,554
- I'll head inside. Thanks.
- All right.

331
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,877
I was stepping out to get something.

332
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,143
Check on her.

333
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:18,526
Okay.

334
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,172
- Min Ju.
- My goodness!

335
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,693
Are you all right?

336
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:36,503
I didn't mean to scare you.

337
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:39,234
You frightened me just now.

338
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,751
Sorry, I'll knock or ring next time.

339
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:47,690
Were you out for groceries?

340
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,695
Yes.

341
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:54,110
After seeing my friends off,
I swung by a store.

342
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,381
From now on, don't be out late alone.

343
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,465
And I'll go with you for groceries.

344
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,067
Are they still together?

345
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:35,680
Leave it. I can do that later.

346
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,223
I'm almost finished.

347
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:39,465
Good grief.

348
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:54,813
What happened? Are you okay?

349
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,832
Yes, I'm fine.

350
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,234
What did you just do?

351
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,692
I was plugging in to make you coffee.

352
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,997
There must be a short circuit.

353
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,752
The fuse is out.

354
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:20,413
But it's really late.

355
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,821
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

356
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:22,904
What?

357
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,350
Are you scared because it's dark?

358
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,088
No, I'm not scared.

359
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,301
My goodness! Stop teasing.

360
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,369
Goodness.

361
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:42,312
No, that can't be right.

362
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,669
I can handle being alone. I'm not scared.

363
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,843
Didn't a strange guy follow you?

364
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:58,161
You could get anxious without any lights.

365
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,800
I'll leave once you fall asleep.

366
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,630
How can I sleep with someone here?

367
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,872
It's not just someone, but me.

368
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,422
- So why not?
- I feel uncomfortable.

369
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:15,917
Do I make you uncomfortable?

370
00:25:20,474 --> 00:25:22,622
No, it's not like that.

371
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:26,868
Maybe you're having weird thoughts.

372
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:30,917
Don't worry, and just stay in bed.

373
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:31,927
My word.

374
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,585
You should get back since you're tired.

375
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,902
No, I'm going to sleep here tonight.

376
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:42,091
Stop messing around and go.

377
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:45,833
Okay, I'll leave in a bit.

378
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,886
You're being so awkward.

379
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:50,579
Good heavens, seriously.

380
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,095
Why are you into an old maid?

381
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,441
What's so great about living alone?

382
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:23,178
I never planned to stay single,

383
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:26,514
but it just turned out that way.

384
00:26:26,514 --> 00:26:28,300
And I got used to it.

385
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:34,149
Now I can't really imagine
living with someone.

386
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:40,444
Do you want to continue living alone?

387
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:42,345
I don't know.

388
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:49,013
It does make me uneasy as I grow older.

389
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:52,589
But I can't marry for that reason alone.

390
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,053
This is why I like you more.

391
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,474
What?

392
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,402
Most people find it to be
lonely and anxious,

393
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:06,705
and they can't bear to break up
even when love ends.

394
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:10,066
And living alone becomes unbearable.

395
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,565
But you're not like that.

396
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:14,401
Who is like that? Ji Seon?

397
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,912
Ji Seon fits the description.

398
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:17,953
Anyone else?

399
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,002
My mother.

400
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:33,840
When I was a kid,
her marriage was basically over.

401
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,371
But she couldn't leave my father,

402
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:40,586
let alone live on her own.

403
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:45,491
I felt bad for her at the time,

404
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,763
but she was supposed to be an adult.

405
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:53,243
It was hard to understand why.

406
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:02,048
I'm sure it was different with her.

407
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,364
Not really.

408
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:07,602
Eventually, she met some other guy...

409
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,556
and is doing well these days.

410
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:17,963
In Canada?

411
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,858
Yes.

412
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,097
I didn't need to say all that.

413
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,272
I'll go now.

414
00:28:31,272 --> 00:28:32,896
Okay.

415
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,952
Stay and go to sleep.

416
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:41,059
Okay. Good night.

417
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,471
I'll replace the fuse tomorrow.

418
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,733
Will I have this chance ever again?

419
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:56,734
What?

420
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,517
Good night.

421
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,145
Good morning.

422
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:28,728
Hello.

423
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,037
- Did you come alone?
- Yes.

424
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,725
- What about Jun Woo?
- He's out getting groceries.

425
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:35,997
I see.

426
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,870
- Are you taking a walk?
- Yes, I guess.

427
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,510
Let's exercise together in the morning.

428
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,240
Why would I get in your way?

429
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,614
What?

430
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:48,487
It's your romantic time with him.

431
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,849
So why would I bother you?

432
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,793
What's there to bother you? It's exercise.

433
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:54,801
How are Yeong Hee and Cheol Su?

434
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,830
They're inseparable as always.
That's very sweet.

435
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:06,035
Yes, two is better than one.

436
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:09,336
That's what you say,

437
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:10,891
but are you going to live alone?

438
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:15,184
Well, I have my family.

439
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:16,912
What if they all leave?

440
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:19,689
Mi Rye and Ye Ji could marry and leave.

441
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,103
Then I'll enjoy my freedom.

442
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,998
But there are times...

443
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:31,958
when living alone makes you afraid.

444
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:32,994
Don't you agree?

445
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:35,452
Well, I suppose.

446
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,260
You know, about Jun Woo...

447
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:44,975
He's a really great guy.

448
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,299
I hope you're good to him.

449
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:49,768
Having known him since childhood,

450
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:51,521
he's like my own brother.

451
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:54,630
There isn't much that I can do.

452
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,327
Dating is awkward after all these years,

453
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:58,594
so it's not easy.

454
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,026
But why are you telling me this?

455
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:07,441
Well, it's because...

456
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:11,345
We're friends.

457
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,965
- Friends.
- Yes.

458
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:18,449
Yes, we're friends.

459
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:22,388
Okay, listen up.

460
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,125
We have to ace this drama project.

461
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:31,010
I know everyone has their own goals,

462
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,760
but if we don't pull this off,

463
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,073
it's going to get rough ahead...

464
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,089
and I can't promise anything.

465
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:40,240
So let's make sure to stay focused...

466
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,666
and give everything to the project.
Got it?

467
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,250
- Okay.
- All right.

468
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:46,427
Okay, let's go.

469
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:51,450
What a nice room.

470
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,255
Mi Rye, which room will you take?

471
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,462
Me? I'm not sure.

472
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:03,827
I'm taking this one, so find another.

473
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:07,260
Don't we have to share since
there aren't many?

474
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,340
I can't sleep with someone else around.

475
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,018
- I'm that sensitive.
- I see.

476
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:13,798
What a nice room.

477
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:18,084
You two can share this one.

478
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,337
There is a living room couch,

479
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:24,553
so I'm good anywhere.

480
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:27,530
You could talk more in the same room.

481
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,827
We have our meetings for talking.

482
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:32,347
Then just for sleeping.

483
00:32:36,097 --> 00:32:37,697
I'm not fussy,

484
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:39,924
so I can sleep just anywhere.

485
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,722
This is so ridiculous.

486
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:51,305
- Since we're at it,
- Right.

487
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,266
- let's make it count.
- Chief Ko.

488
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:00,319
Make sure to prepare well
for the drama project.

489
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,977
I was at the state office for that.

490
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:03,977
The state office?

491
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,913
To look over the regional budget.

492
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,008
I see.

493
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:11,077
Your team can also take this...

494
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:12,649
and have it done promptly.

495
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:15,304
What's this?

496
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:18,005
You know that cruise by the coast?

497
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,174
Yes, it's been unattended for some time.

498
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,847
Now it's practically useless.

499
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,990
That's why you should get it running...

500
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,572
and make it a tourist attraction.

501
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,922
The Corporate Support Team
secured that budget...

502
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,055
Stop questioning your superior...

503
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:40,561
and shoulder whatever you're given.

504
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,740
Shouldn't you lead by example?

505
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:47,000
Work hard.

506
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,020
Yes, sir.

507
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:51,530
Chief, you know nobody wants it...

508
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,841
because it's a ticking bomb.

509
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,011
With all the squeezed budget...

510
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,191
The whole thing can blow up on us.

511
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:03,160
Let's go.

512
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,849
This is so frustrating.

513
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:12,206
Good grief, I'm hungry.

514
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,126
It should be here any minute.

515
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:15,126
What's coming?

516
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:21,933
Come in.

517
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:24,150
Hello. I got your delivery.

518
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,902
What are you doing here?

519
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:28,350
I ordered us some takeout.

520
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,510
Aren't you that guy?

521
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,961
The producer's boyfriend?

522
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,565
You're a handsome guy who even cooks.

523
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm flattered. Enjoy.

524
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,255
Aren't you swamped with work?

525
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:48,622
It gives him an excuse to see you again.

526
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,150
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

527
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,012
You seem perfectly dashing and young,

528
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,686
so what do you even see in her?

529
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,145
Well...

530
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,842
She's an amazing and beautiful woman.

531
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,451
Unlike those who speak without thinking,

532
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:07,689
she is very considerate.

533
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,074
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:14,149
It's okay. Let's eat.

535
00:35:14,149 --> 00:35:15,950
I'll enjoy it. Thanks.

536
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,830
Are you surprised I came abruptly?

537
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,430
No, I'm very grateful.

538
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,537
Are you sure?

539
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,023
Honestly, it makes me uncomfortable.

540
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:35,837
I see.

541
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,573
Just ring me up next time.

542
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:40,573
Sure thing.

543
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,824
I won't show up abruptly next time,

544
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,938
but call you to get permission beforehand.

545
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,576
Is Ji Seon at the cafe?

546
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,222
Why? Does it bother you?

547
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:53,641
No.

548
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:59,267
Even if she doesn't admit it,
she'd be hurting.

549
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:03,372
So you're not annoyed by her,

550
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:04,695
but just concerned.

551
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:07,644
After breaking up with you,

552
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:10,101
she'd feel cut off from the world.

553
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:15,155
As if everything has ended.

554
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:17,894
How do you know her so well?

555
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:21,934
I've been there before.

556
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:24,805
Your first love?

557
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,419
Yes.

558
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:33,397
Love was everything then.

559
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:41,543
I had even sent out wedding invitations.

560
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:44,015
Is that right?

561
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:47,907
But?

562
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,103
There was an accident.

563
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:58,165
When I reached the hospital,
it was too late.

564
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,837
It must have been painful.

565
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:13,199
Ji Seon also lost her parents
in an accident, right?

566
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:18,377
You left when she relied on you.

567
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:20,197
So coming after you like this...

568
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:24,158
is expected and understandable.

569
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,078
But being too nice to her...

570
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,057
would only make things harder.

571
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:32,365
Anyway, don't be too worried.

572
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:34,471
She just needs some time...

573
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,320
to mature on her own.

574
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:48,466
Why did they shut it down
when it looks decent?

575
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,109
The fare was expensive,

576
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,391
and the ride wasn't special.

577
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:56,837
- Have you brought a camera?
- Yes, sir.

578
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:59,495
- Get some photos of the front.
- Sure.

579
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:00,800
And some more shots of the side.

580
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,930
All right.

581
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:12,857
What a hunk.

582
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,327
Are you taking shots of me?

583
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:28,516
Nope.

584
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,855
Then are you taking photos of a plane?

585
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:38,160
Isn't that Chief Ko?

586
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:40,872
You're right.

587
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:45,684
- Sang Sik.
- Hello.

588
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:47,934
Chief Ko, are you working out here?

589
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,247
Yes, what brings you here?

590
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:51,148
There was a meeting nearby.

591
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:54,213
Mi Rye said it was a quiet place to talk.

592
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:56,477
And Jun Woo brought over a packed lunch.

593
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:58,213
Is that so?

594
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,197
Are you preparing for our city drama?

595
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:01,204
Yes.

596
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:03,310
I saw your video post online.

597
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,516
You're a true star now.

598
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:07,231
I saw it, too. It was cute and fun.

599
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:10,744
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

600
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:12,362
Ms. Han, it's been a while.

601
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:14,008
Indeed.

602
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:16,817
Are you here to see Chief Ko?

603
00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:18,474
No.

604
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:20,296
I was in the area for work,

605
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,768
then spotted him here.

606
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:25,175
Could you take our picture?

607
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,709
What picture?

608
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,557
There is a nice view here.

609
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:32,900
When will I get another chance
to take it with you?

610
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,958
- But...
- You're a star now.

611
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,141
Make sure it's a good one.

612
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,542
Here, I can take it.

613
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:42,451
No, please take a nice photo.

614
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,120
Sure.

615
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,049
Why are you asking to take photos?

616
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:51,764
Stand closer together.

617
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,764
Okay.

618
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,780
- What's with you?
- Hold still.

619
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,355
We're short on time, so hurry.

620
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,482
All right.

621
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:02,442
Ready? One, two, three.

622
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,743
Thanks for that.

623
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:12,878
Don't we look great together?

624
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,526
Yes, indeed.

625
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:18,236
See? We have good chemistry.

626
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,205
Mystery?

627
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:22,247
Chemistry.

628
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,525
We'll get going. Ms. Han, take care.

629
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:26,941
Goodbye.

630
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,149
I'll see you later.

631
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:29,743
I'm off then.

632
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:36,375
What's gotten into you?

633
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,772
I was seeking revenge.

634
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:39,846
Revenge?

635
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,165
You called her a friend and a neighbor,

636
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,827
but something struck different.

637
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:50,309
I sensed something peculiar between you.

638
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,788
What are you talking about?

639
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:55,052
It's a gut feeling.

640
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,251
There is something awkward,

641
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,923
but it also feels like a signal.

642
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,606
That's why I acted that way.

643
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,710
Good heavens.

644
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:07,750
Wait for me.

645
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:13,229
It's really fixed.

646
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:24,435
Hello, Jun Woo.

647
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:26,284
Are you home?

648
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,562
Yes, I just came back.

649
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:33,870
Thanks, it's much brighter now.

650
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,183
No problem.

651
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,407
There is a cooking class today.

652
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,458
It starts soon, so come down.

653
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,230
Right now?

654
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,688
Yes. Why?

655
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:46,289
Okay, I'll be there.

656
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:56,369
- Delicious.
- Right?

657
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:02,079
But isn't Jun Woo such a hottie?

658
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,946
Who would get to marry him?

659
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,295
I'm dying to know.

660
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:06,465
He's totally my type.

661
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:09,568
We're single, so there is a chance.

662
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,497
I'm sure he has someone.

663
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:14,579
She must be cute and pretty, right?

664
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:15,725
I guess.

665
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:19,194
All right, good work today.

666
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:21,751
It's you who deserve praise.

667
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:24,105
By the way, are you seeing anybody?

668
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,839
Well, this is my...

669
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:28,678
No.

670
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:31,591
You're such a prankster.

671
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,935
Tell me about it.

672
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:34,862
You've got such great humor,

673
00:42:34,862 --> 00:42:37,249
and always looking out for us.

674
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:41,812
It's hot in here.

675
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:48,761
Are we not supposed to tell?

676
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:51,956
What would they think?

677
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:54,583
Who cares about them? This is about us.

678
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,439
Can't I introduce you as my girl?

679
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:00,585
What?

680
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,238
When you talk like that,

681
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,254
I must admit that it feels good.

682
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,262
I'm not trying to flatter you.

683
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:11,865
I mean what I say.

684
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:17,655
Deceived by your feelings,

685
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:21,057
you could be overestimating me.

686
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,599
What...

687
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:27,908
What is that supposed to mean?

688
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:34,641
I'm nothing more than an older woman.

689
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:36,760
Why are you suddenly losing confidence?

690
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,450
Don't listen to what others say.

691
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,092
That's become harder for me.

692
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:46,511
When I was younger, it didn't matter
if a potato was hot.

693
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,955
I grabbed at it, anyway.

694
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,801
Now I don't want to do that.

695
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:58,397
So what about now?

696
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:01,030
Now I wait for it to cool,

697
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,095
so I don't get burned and stay safe.

698
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:07,220
I've become more cautious like that,

699
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,319
and I don't take those leaps anymore.

700
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,776
All right.

701
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:17,079
I was only thinking of myself.

702
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:21,431
Sir, everyone is heading out.

703
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:23,630
All right.

704
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:20,207
Perhaps I didn't need someone to love,

705
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:23,489
but missed the feeling of being in love.

706
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:35,562
Is your class over?

707
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,745
Play something for me.

708
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:46,725
Good grief.

709
00:45:48,142 --> 00:45:49,347
Here you go.

710
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,374
Do you like it?

711
00:45:56,374 --> 00:46:00,847
Yes, I always like the tunes you play.

712
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:08,168
What is it, what's wrong?

713
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,304
It's nothing.

714
00:46:17,053 --> 00:46:18,216
Jun Woo.

715
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:25,065
It's tough with Min Ju.

716
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:27,718
What?

717
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,091
I liked that she's older.

718
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,452
I mean, I still like her.

719
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:35,133
But since she's more grown-up,

720
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,168
she's not pleased with my ways.

721
00:46:38,168 --> 00:46:40,280
No way.

722
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,820
What's lacking in your love and care?

723
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:46,181
I'm too young.

724
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:53,235
There could be an age difference.

725
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:57,456
But you have the soul of an old man.

726
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:58,491
Goodness.

727
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:01,304
Park Jun Woo.

728
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:05,408
You found someone you like,

729
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,175
and I'm glad for you.

730
00:47:07,175 --> 00:47:10,080
I thought you weren't a fan of Min Ju.

731
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,680
That's because I didn't know
what she was like before.

732
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,824
When you're with someone,

733
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:19,535
there is bound to be trouble.

734
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:22,455
You might not like some things,

735
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:26,344
and you learn what ticks her off.

736
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:30,598
It's just a part of getting
to know each other.

737
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:36,458
Thanks, Sang Sik.

738
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,472
I should be thanking you.

739
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:40,650
Why is that?

740
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:45,464
Despite being young and everything,

741
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:47,404
I was worried you wouldn't date anyone.

742
00:47:47,404 --> 00:47:51,263
What does age have to do with it?

743
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:54,790
I just hope you find someone yourself.

744
00:47:55,427 --> 00:47:56,558
You son of a gun.

745
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,876
Hello, Mom.

746
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:04,017
How is Dad doing?

747
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,026
He is showing early symptoms.

748
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:09,097
But if he stays on treatment,
they won't get worse.

749
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,508
Goodness, I hope that's true.

750
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,541
I'm here for him, so don't worry.

751
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,091
Why keep calling me when you're busy?

752
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:20,777
I just wanted to hear your voice.

753
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:22,538
I must be getting old.

754
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:25,914
Who are you complaining so much about age?

755
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:27,802
You're still young.

756
00:48:27,802 --> 00:48:30,747
Maybe you're lonely after all the work
without any romance.

757
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:32,785
That could be.

758
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,370
After not dating for very long,

759
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,673
I think my heart's broken.

760
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:42,528
If you can't find someone to love,

761
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:45,905
meet someone who loves you
and treats you well.

762
00:48:45,905 --> 00:48:47,732
That makes life easier.

763
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:50,109
Really?

764
00:48:51,538 --> 00:48:53,212
Do you really think so?

765
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,106
Sweetheart.

766
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:11,122
Are you coming home early today?

767
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:13,626
- Why?
- What do you think?

768
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:16,241
You've been getting back late.

769
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,904
Dad's been hitting the gym after school.

770
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:21,328
He's even gained some muscles.

771
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:22,465
The gym?

772
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:24,787
I'm doing it to build strength.

773
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:27,815
Does he exercise?

774
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:29,945
Exercise?

775
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:31,609
He doesn't go near it.

776
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:34,273
Even when I ask to take a walk,
he keeps to the house.

777
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:36,042
Breathing is his exercise.

778
00:49:36,951 --> 00:49:39,185
So that's what it was.

779
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,466
Why didn't you tell me? I can join you.

780
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:43,167
Where? What exercise?

781
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,034
It's just a gym near the school.

782
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,697
I had no idea about that.

783
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:49,449
I'll get you some restoratives.

784
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,890
Forget it. Don't waste money.

785
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,919
Why is spending on you wasting money?

786
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,202
I'll make ginseng chicken soup tonight,

787
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,605
so come home early.

788
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:00,284
I want my chicken locally bred.

789
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:03,130
You should take a hint.

790
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,782
Do you know what day it is?

791
00:50:06,782 --> 00:50:08,238
Of course.

792
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,920
The class evaluations are due today.

793
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:12,949
We'll head out first.

794
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,000
All right.

795
00:50:19,093 --> 00:50:20,208
What's the matter?

796
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,619
Sang Sik, why did I get married?

797
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,267
Not again. I'm off.

798
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:35,387
My word.

799
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:41,011
Come on, wake up.

800
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:44,106
- Goodness.
- Look at the time.

801
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:45,426
Did you come already?

802
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,725
My stomach hurts.

803
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,132
It's urgent.

804
00:50:56,282 --> 00:50:58,232
I'm in a rush.

805
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,010
Can you close the door?

806
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,392
Why are you out here?

807
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,003
Ms. Na was in a hurry.

808
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,009
What?

809
00:51:18,845 --> 00:51:20,246
Good grief.

810
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:22,583
Come with me.

811
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,682
You can use the tap here, it's all right.

812
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,921
My word, you're even cuter in the morning.

813
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:44,095
Ms. Han.

814
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:47,961
What's this for?

815
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,199
Well, you see...

816
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:55,333
I suppose it could happen,

817
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,848
but isn't that a bit too much?

818
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:00,644
What do you mean?

819
00:52:00,644 --> 00:52:02,949
I know he's a widower,

820
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:05,486
but you and the Chief...

821
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:08,378
Did I give out wedding invitations?

822
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,299
It's just called dating.

823
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:15,096
Are you saying he's okay with dating...

824
00:52:15,096 --> 00:52:16,937
someone who is so much younger?

825
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:20,312
You see, I'm not underage.

826
00:52:20,312 --> 00:52:24,520
And why do you assume that
Chief Ko won't date?

827
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,129
Well, as someone executing public duties,

828
00:52:28,129 --> 00:52:29,512
having this in our office...

829
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:32,078
Has my relationship with Chief Ko...

830
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,872
disrupted work in any way?

831
00:52:34,872 --> 00:52:38,432
This is just my personal life.

832
00:52:38,432 --> 00:52:42,564
So if you're not being jealous,
please don't bother.

833
00:52:42,564 --> 00:52:45,088
I'll go now.

834
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,931
I think the female lead's character...

835
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:57,276
will be more relatable to what
I've established for her.

836
00:52:57,276 --> 00:52:59,791
She waits for the man she loves.

837
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:02,492
Any other thoughts?

838
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:04,543
I don't see it that way.

839
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:07,389
Instead of waiting for the man,

840
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:10,038
she waits for a chance to love again.

841
00:53:10,038 --> 00:53:11,973
That seems more convincing.

842
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:14,509
I must side with Ms. Ko on this.

843
00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:16,957
Ms. Ko, you don't understand drama.

844
00:53:16,957 --> 00:53:20,142
I love dramas, and I've watched a lot.

845
00:53:20,142 --> 00:53:22,568
Watching and writing aren't the same.

846
00:53:22,568 --> 00:53:24,524
Why are you picking at...

847
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:26,277
Let's not argue about this.

848
00:53:26,277 --> 00:53:28,944
Okay, we can discuss this later.

849
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:41,290
You used to play the piano so well.

850
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,706
What does that matter now?

851
00:53:42,706 --> 00:53:46,322
It's been ages, and my fingers are stiff.

852
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:48,660
I'm just getting old now.

853
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,362
Don't say that.

854
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:52,299
You should start playing again.

855
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:54,234
Hun will be a senior next year.

856
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:58,266
And my husband needs a promotion
to become a principal.

857
00:53:58,266 --> 00:54:01,931
They need me more than the piano.

858
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:04,083
You should live your own life.

859
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,802
They can manage on their own.

860
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:08,349
I couldn't ask for more.

861
00:54:09,299 --> 00:54:11,733
Why did I have to get married?

862
00:54:16,137 --> 00:54:17,461
(Sang Hee's wedding anniversary)

863
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:22,060
Isn't today your anniversary?

864
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,742
You're sweet as always.

865
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:28,619
But doesn't your husband know?

866
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,917
If he knew what today meant,

867
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:33,358
I wouldn't be regretting my marriage.

868
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:43,756
It must have been rough
after your divorce.

869
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:45,469
Of course.

870
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,320
But I'm okay now.

871
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,948
Doesn't it get lonely?

872
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:52,144
There is always loneliness whether
you're alone or with someone.

873
00:54:52,144 --> 00:54:53,432
Don't you agree?

874
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:54,587
That's true.

875
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:58,121
How long has it been since
you got divorced?

876
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,897
Well, you see...

877
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:05,977
- I'm sorry.
- You can take the call.

878
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:07,763
(Person Staying at Home)

879
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:12,256
I think marriage...

880
00:55:12,256 --> 00:55:15,312
comes with sacrifice,
responsibility, and pressure.

881
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,567
You have to say and do things
regardless of how you feel.

882
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,514
It's like wearing a mask.

883
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:24,282
I'm not sure how to live without regrets.

884
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:27,425
"I knew if I stayed long enough,
this would happen."

885
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:29,819
Yes, Bernard Shaw.

886
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,111
That's a great quote.

887
00:55:31,943 --> 00:55:33,639
Let's drink.

888
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:34,725
I'll pass.

889
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:37,078
I have to teach yoga tomorrow.

890
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:39,278
But we just got warmed up.

891
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:40,472
Let's go.

892
00:55:41,094 --> 00:55:43,216
Just one more drink.

893
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,156
- Sang Hee.
- Aunt.

894
00:56:10,156 --> 00:56:11,936
- Mom.
- Sister.

895
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:17,641
Where is your dad?

896
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,199
He's not home yet.

897
00:56:27,045 --> 00:56:29,190
Today is their wedding anniversary.

898
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,143
I can't believe my dad.

899
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,386
(Last Summer Clearance Sales)

900
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:44,440
What are you doing?

901
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:47,959
Hello there.

902
00:56:47,959 --> 00:56:51,232
Are you doing
another road inspection here?

903
00:56:51,232 --> 00:56:54,311
Yes, I'm checking unauthorized banners...

904
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,280
or what gets in the way of pedestrians.

905
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,903
That's what this is.

906
00:56:58,903 --> 00:57:00,335
I'm here to meet someone.

907
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:01,715
- I see.
- Take care.

908
00:57:01,715 --> 00:57:02,868
Yes, have a good night.

909
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,701
- Producer Han.
- Hello.

910
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:10,672
Who do we have here?

911
00:57:12,477 --> 00:57:13,499
Hello.

912
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:15,140
Do you know each other?

913
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,101
How do you know Chief Ko?

914
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,588
Well, before...

915
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:19,826
Before,

916
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:24,872
I met him at a city event.

917
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:26,709
Right.

918
00:57:27,387 --> 00:57:29,148
But how do you know him?

919
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:31,295
We met about the plagiarism issue.

920
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,887
Right, you're Ms. Ko's brother.

921
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,039
Now we're neighbors.

922
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,322
He lives next door.

923
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:40,682
So the guy next door is...

924
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,671
- What is it?
- What?

925
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:49,877
I'll get going.

926
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:51,316
Okay.

927
00:57:57,496 --> 00:57:58,833
Here.

928
00:57:58,833 --> 00:57:59,833
Right.

929
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:08,494
Are you dating that neighbor guy?

930
00:58:08,494 --> 00:58:10,025
What are you talking about?

931
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:12,557
Never mind.

932
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:14,533
How did your reference check go?

933
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,063
I just looked around.

934
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:21,811
What? Your socks mismatch.

935
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:23,316
Really?

936
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:25,083
Can't you tell blue from gray?

937
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,644
- This is me.
- Good grief.

938
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,005
To tell you the truth, I got divorced.

939
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:34,825
- What?
- It's been about a year.

940
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:36,353
Why didn't you say anything?

941
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:40,075
Just because.
I didn't want things to get awkward.

942
00:58:40,075 --> 00:58:42,939
What's there to be awkward about?

943
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:43,981
Divorce?

944
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,508
Gang Min Ju.

945
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:52,125
Have you moved on from it all?

946
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:54,305
From what?

947
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:55,438
Eun Ho.

948
00:59:00,113 --> 00:59:01,861
Why are you mentioning him?

949
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,142
I'm just reminiscing.

950
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,975
For crying out loud.

951
00:59:15,215 --> 00:59:16,453
You're back.

952
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:17,453
Yes.

953
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:22,326
Ji Seon.

954
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:27,621
I'm saying this out of concern for you.

955
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:29,308
Excuse me?

956
00:59:29,308 --> 00:59:31,252
I'm just saying that...

957
00:59:31,252 --> 00:59:34,434
this might be out of line from worry.

958
00:59:34,434 --> 00:59:37,407
It's okay. You can tell me.

959
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,423
I know you're staying here briefly,

960
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:44,496
and that Jun Woo agreed to it.

961
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:46,447
But for your future,

962
00:59:46,447 --> 00:59:50,323
I don't think being here will help you.

963
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:54,686
First, thank you for caring.

964
00:59:54,686 --> 00:59:57,105
I know what you're trying to say.

965
00:59:59,486 --> 01:00:02,631
But there is no other way.

966
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:04,634
This is all I can do right now.

967
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,992
I see.

968
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:12,866
Then I hope you find some peace
during your stay here.

969
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,569
Yes, thank you.

970
01:00:17,032 --> 01:00:18,604
I'll head in now.

01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,635
"SS."

972
01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:48,835
It's exactly like mine.

973
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:51,775
That can't be.

974
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:55,146
Mine has "SS" marked on it.

975
01:00:56,464 --> 01:01:00,061
Where did you get this?

976
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:01,472
My wife gave it to me.

977
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,549
Come on now, take a seat.

978
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:16,229
Don't worry about it.

979
01:01:16,229 --> 01:01:19,437
Why would you bother when
my husband doesn't?

980
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:20,660
Come on.

981
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,149
There are days like this in marriage.

982
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:25,413
Ye Ji, how can you say that?

983
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:27,220
You celebrated the 50th and 100th Day
with your boyfriend.

984
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,964
So why should I have to suffer
this indignity?

985
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:30,844
He's probably busy today.

986
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:34,959
Busy? I'm sure he doesn't know about it.

987
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:37,420
Uncle, can I have this now?

988
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,468
Not yet. I need to marinate it.

989
01:01:40,106 --> 01:01:41,409
You wait here.

990
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:43,642
I'll finish up and bring Sang Sik.

991
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:45,853
Let's have a drink, okay?

992
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:48,466
I'll take care of that.

993
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:51,850
No, you get to sit and relax today.

994
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,850
Okay?

("Paradise for Youth")

996
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:10,847
Hello.

What brings you here?

998
01:02:17,907 --> 01:02:19,021
Look...

999
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:24,940
Have you seen this before?

1000
01:02:33,004 --> 01:02:35,940
It looks exactly like yours.

1001
01:02:37,907 --> 01:02:40,879
Where did you get that?

1002
01:02:46,235 --> 01:02:50,912
It's a keepsake of my boyfriend.

1003
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:52,457
The person I talked about.

1004
01:02:55,408 --> 01:02:56,515
Is that right?

1005
01:02:59,897 --> 01:03:01,889
I don't know what this says.

1006
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:04,800
It seems to be a name.

1007
01:03:06,462 --> 01:03:07,541

- Sang Sik!

No.

1012
01:03:38,337 --> 01:03:42,146
Hurry and escape.

1013
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,329
Don't let go.

1014
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:45,929
Don't let go!

1015
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:47,538
Grab on!

1016
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:49,180
Grab on, Eun Ho!

1017
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,676
- Eun Ho!
- Sang Sik.

1018
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:52,600
Don't let go of me!

1019
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,290
- Eun Ho!
- Sang Sik.

1020
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:57,858
Eun Ho!

1021
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:00,736
Eun Ho!

1022
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,088
Eun Ho!

1023
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:21,457
What's wrong?

1024
01:04:33,397 --> 01:04:34,424
The truth is...

1025
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:36,376
Sang Sik.

1026
01:04:38,397 --> 01:04:39,521
Min Ju.

1027
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:11,469
(Second To Last Love)

1028
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:13,858
Min Ju, what did you want to ask him?

1029
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:14,914
Is it between you guys?

1030
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:17,051
I like it here. I'm not leaving.

1031
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,224
It's so hard to love.

1032
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:20,247
I don't want to end it.

1033
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:21,615
This hurts too much.

1034
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:23,051
Join me for...

1035
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:24,276
You're a disappointment.

1036
01:05:24,276 --> 01:05:25,908
- She's too young for you.
- What?

1037
01:05:25,908 --> 01:05:30,357
I think... Sang Sik likes her.

1038
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:31,571
I know.

1039
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,507
It was all my fault.

1040
01:05:34,088 --> 01:05:35,866
What are you talking about?

1041
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:37,866
