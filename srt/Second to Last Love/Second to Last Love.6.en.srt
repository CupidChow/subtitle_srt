1
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:14,261
I'm capable of keeping a garden.

2
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,609
That's one of the reasons
why I moved here.

3
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,951
In my younger years,

4
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:27,342
what could have made me so frantic
that I didn't even try?

5
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:32,629
Now, afraid of people's stares,

6
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,253
I have grown into someone
who doesn't take risks.

7
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:37,381
People are staring.

8
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:40,084
Come on, why do you care
what others think?

9
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,804
Who cares if they stare?

10
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:44,029
Starting now, focus on yourself.

11
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,790
Hop on and push.

12
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,324
This won't work.

13
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:05,706
It's okay. One more time.

14
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,322
Good, you're doing it.

15
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,025
My word! This is cool!

16
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,380
(Second to Last Love)

17
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,695
Are you okay?

18
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:02,435
I'm going to collapse.

19
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:04,987
You can do better if you're not nervous.

20
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:06,275
Same time tomorrow?

21
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,420
No, I really can't do this.

22
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:10,960
I just remembered.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,813
There is a cooking class today.

24
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:16,077
Class? Right, your culinary course.

25
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:19,258
Yes, we hold a dessert party tonight.

26
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:21,577
Sorry for taking up your time.

27
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:23,505
No, you made time for me.

28
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,888
Join us. You were keen on cooking.

29
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:28,323
No, I'm quite swamped.

30
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:30,876
Is that how you shied away
from new interests?

31
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:33,020
And tired of living that way,

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,837
you brought this out.

33
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:36,119
You figured me out.

34
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,333
But I can't really help it.

35
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,974
Just take it one step at a time.

36
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,856
You'll miss out and regret it
if you wait longer.

37
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:47,995
Let's go.

38
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:02,256
My dad bought it on a whim
three years back.

39
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,138
It's unused, not even for my graduation.

40
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,953
Three years makes it old.

41
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:09,270
Sell it for 350 dollars.

42
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:13,782
Are you crazy? It's an expensive camera.

43
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,038
You can look elsewhere.

44
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:17,558
I can pay 420 dollars.

45
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:20,495
It must be 500 dollars. No more discount.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,939
Thanks for coming all this way.

47
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,364
We're lucky our neighbor knows
such an excellent tutor.

48
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,693
You're too kind.

49
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:29,821
Is Hun in his room?

50
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:31,779
Yes, he's been expecting you.

51
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,467
Hun, your essay tutor is here.

52
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,651
Hello.

53
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,308
You must be Hun.

54
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,336
You're handsome like your father.

55
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:40,681
I take after my mom.

56
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,182
Right, I see.

57
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,197
Getting her as a teacher wasn't easy,
so study hard.

58
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,254
Okay.

59
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,180
Then I'll bring you some fruit.

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,599
- Get to know each other.
- Okay.

61
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,662
- You can sit over here.
- This here is fine.

62
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,925
My word, what's this?

63
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,071
The lens!

64
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:04,965
You broke my camera.

65
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:07,488
Why did you leave it here?

66
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,593
Just pay me 53 dollars for repair.

67
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,489
No haggling!

68
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,712
My goodness!

69
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,058
- Hello.
- You made it.

70
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,696
It sure is hot today.

71
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,500
You're here. Hello.

72
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,115
Are you expecting someone?

73
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,320
How did you know?

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,512
You know me.

75
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:36,951
Even your shadow tells me
whether you're happy or sad.

76
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:38,551
I'm expecting Min Ju.

77
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you mean our neighbor?

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,057
Are you two really dating?

79
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,016
If she shows up today,

80
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:48,438
- I'll make it Day One for us.
- Day One?

81
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,949
Do you know how people count
their days together?

82
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,020
If she comes today,

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,411
I'm going to make it official.

84
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,506
Why do you need a definite date?

85
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,835
What's with the counting?

86
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,387
And what exactly makes it official?

87
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,925
Do you talk about it before
coming up with a date?

88
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,379
Or does someone randomly decide?

89
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,780
I'm taking the liberty. So what?

90
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,822
Why am I even discussing this with you?

91
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:09,264
My goodness.

92
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,293
That's new in your garden.
You bought them?

93
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:27,222
Of course, they can't grow themselves.

94
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,844
Step out of the way.

95
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,104
(Delicious Note)

96
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:59,295
Hello there, Mi Rye.

97
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,021
Hi.

98
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,870
What brings you here?

99
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:11,142
What brings me here?
I'm here to see Jun Woo.

100
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,812
- Did you have dinner?
- I ate already.

101
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:29,023
Aren't you going to Uncle Jun Woo's
dessert party tonight?

102
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,078
Stick to one thing at a time.

103
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,304
Whether it's studying or exercise.

104
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:38,726
Where are you going?

105
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,176
I'm finished.

106
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:45,745
Is this a teen thing after turning 17?

107
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,380
Hello, everyone.

108
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,377
Today is someone's birthday in class.

109
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,832
So we'll make birthday party desserts.

110
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:03,820
Let's see who can assist me.

111
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,563
It can be our new student.

112
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,729
Come out here.

113
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,627
It's nothing hard for someone new.

114
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,331
You should go out.

115
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,329
My goodness, it's been ages since
I've had Jun's food.

116
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,625
Ji Seon, Jun Woo's class is starting,

117
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,642
so I have to get out there.

118
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:29,955
I won't keep you.

119
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:33,992
Delicious.

120
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:37,369
The food is to be used
for the party later.

121
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,399
I'll just grab one since you have plenty.

122
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,583
I don't want to be stingy with food,

123
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,519
but if Jun Woo finds out...

124
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,247
Tell him I'm here.

125
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,738
I won't disturb the class.

126
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,814
Grated carrots and pecans.

127
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:57,894
And here we have coconut.

128
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,743
When you mix them,

129
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,162
a nutty and chewy flavor is created.

130
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,850
It's absolutely delicious.

131
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,714
And with this texture,

132
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,637
even folks who aren't fans of carrots
will be able to enjoy it.

133
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,047
Pour soy milk instead of milk.

134
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,243
My word!

135
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,313
Yes, I will.

136
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,460
How much should I add?

137
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,290
Three cups.

138
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,342
Okay.

139
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:44,044
How could you come here?

140
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:46,398
You really changed your number.

141
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:47,540
That's why I showed up.

142
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,156
Don't you have any pride?

143
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,772
I said you get on my nerves.

144
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,016
Was it that woman earlier?

145
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,776
- What?
- You said there is someone.

146
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,340
She's the one you cooked with.

147
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:02,942
The way you looked at her gave it away.

148
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,419
I couldn't help but notice.

149
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,855
Just bear with me for a month.

150
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:10,895
For a month?

151
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:12,974
The agency I worked with called.

152
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:15,061
I'll be back on the stage...

153
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,993
and even start modeling.

154
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:19,779
So let me stay just for a month.

155
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,731
I'll just be around.

156
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,462
Think of me as a part-timer.

157
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,523
Do you want to work here for a month?

158
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,370
Leave now, and don't ever come back.

159
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,818
I'll call the cops if you show your face.

160
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:35,319
Be nice to send me away faster,
if you hate me so much.

161
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,632
Bastard.

162
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:41,742
You're despicable.

163
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:49,923
Jun Woo.

164
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,103
People are waiting. Hurry out.

165
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,768
Yes, all right.

166
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,808
(Delicious Note)

167
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:10,683
Sorry, it's my fault.

168
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:12,925
No, it's okay.

169
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,748
You're pretty enough, but a bit old.

170
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:21,476
Are you talking to me?

171
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:22,831
You done with that?

172
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,178
Yes.

173
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,542
Then I'll take it.

174
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:31,018
I don't think you're supposed to.

175
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,579
Well, I'm a fan.

176
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,994
Do you like this guy?

177
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
What?

178
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,823
Have you tried his boiled rice
with assorted mixtures?

179
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,936
The one he made.

180
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:51,852
No.

181
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,772
What about his bulgogi and
stir-fried glass noodles?

182
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,190
I haven't.

183
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:58,771
Okay.

184
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Look here.

185
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,688
Why are you asking me all this?

186
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:14,246
Good grief, what's her problem?

187
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:16,066
Isn't she younger than me?

188
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,918
What a waste of long legs.

189
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,927
I'm not sure if I should be
even bringing it up.

190
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,723
Jun Woo's girlfriend?

191
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,554
I don't get what you're saying.

192
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:33,855
I happened to see Jun Woo
while on my blind date.

193
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,425
He was being cold and mean
to a young woman.

194
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:42,241
I could tell he had something
going on with her.

195
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,773
The Jun Woo you think you know...

196
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:46,673
might not be who he really is.

197
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,232
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

198
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,214
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,078
I asked you to help,
but made a mess of it.

200
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,557
No, I should've been more helpful.

201
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,039
I'm too clumsy.

202
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,881
Make sure you keep coming to class.

203
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,643
I'll try. It was quite enjoyable.

204
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,565
It seems you have fans.

205
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,687
What fans?

206
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,612
There was a tall woman earlier.

207
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,332
She took your magazine,
claiming to be one.

208
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,353
Did she really?

209
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,539
That must be nice.

210
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,747
Min Ju, have you ever cooked for
someone special?

211
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:32,423
Well, I probably have a few times.

212
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:35,217
I make good instant noodles,
don’t underestimate me!

213
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,036
I'd like to try those instant noodles.

214
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:40,092
Then who have you cooked for?

215
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,008
Well...

216
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,803
It was mostly for family and friends.

217
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,618
And back in Canada...

218
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,053
Never mind.

219
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:56,597
Why are you leaving it off there?

220
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,077
Today is Day One.

221
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,760
What do you mean by Day One?

222
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,335
That's all you need to know.
Thanks for coming.

223
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:05,462
Have a good night.

224
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,096
All right, take care.

225
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,783
Today is Day One.

226
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,974
You've planted all the seedlings already.

227
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,453
Can I look after these ones?

228
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,167
No.

229
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:21,053
Come on, I can do a good job.
I won't kill them.

230
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:25,864
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

231
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,285
You even have a notebook for it.

232
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,478
I just follow these steps, right?

233
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:33,685
It's not that simple.

234
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:36,672
Search online if you have questions.
It has all the information.

235
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:41,760
Really? Then I'll take this plot.

236
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,970
You can't back out.

237
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,537
I'll think of it as community service.

238
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,273
Community service?

239
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:51,115
Yes, now you're a resident here.

240
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,315
Well, thank you.

241
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,471
Community service? Good heavens.

242
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,259
Woori City's promotional campaign?

243
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,332
Yes, we need to promote the city
in the summer peak season,

244
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,490
so let's brainstorm ideas.

245
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,627
Focus on what is applicable right away.

246
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,106
That's social media.

247
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:14,050
By actively promoting it online,

248
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,738
it would be a piece of cake.

249
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:16,914
Let's go with that.

250
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,098
But the content and presentation
are what matters here.

251
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,403
What are we going to make and share?

252
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,067
I know. What about a city song?

253
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,506
Do you mean like, make a song?

254
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,795
Yes, a song.

255
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,154
We can use our squirrel mascot...

256
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:30,650
in the promotional song.

257
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,269
You know, like for election campaigns.

258
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,452
Woori City drama?

259
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,569
Gang Min Ju, you pitch for it.

260
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,832
Sir.

261
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:44,568
Are you throwing leftovers my way
because I got demoted?

262
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,608
What leftovers?

263
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,098
You want me to make a drama
promoting the city hall.

264
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,822
It's not a city hall promotional drama.
How many times must I...

265
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,054
Give it to someone else.

266
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:53,678
Are you sure you won't take it?

267
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,197
- Then let me have it.
- Stop it!

268
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,445
But she turned it down.

269
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:01,190
It's not something we can make
because we want to.

270
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,814
The networks are pitching like crazy...

271
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,596
to get their hands on it.

272
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,882
So why won't you do it?

273
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,367
Didn't you know?

274
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,719
Have you lost your inside track?

275
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:15,248
Your connections must have dried up.

276
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,367
If another network picks this up,

277
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,730
I'll get sacked.

278
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,480
Is that what it is?

279
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,323
Then I'll take a look at it.

280
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,953
Woori City song?

281
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:34,072
Do you want to make a promotional song?

282
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:37,271
Yes, it can attract tourists
in the peak season.

283
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,786
The idea came up today.

284
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:43,349
That's great. I'm good with songs.

285
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,372
- What?
- Let's make something nice.

286
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,752
Yes, all right.

287
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,581
As for the drama you mentioned...

288
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,148
The drama project...

289
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,517
will be handled by Director Shin.

290
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,346
So don't worry about it.

291
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:01,701
But tell me,

292
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,248
why are you never on board
when it's about dramas?

293
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,441
Don't you watch any dramas at all?

294
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,838
No, I watch news programs
and documentaries...

295
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,816
because they suit me more.

296
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:17,397
Where shall we have lunch today?

297
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:18,895
I'm going to the cafeteria.

298
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,199
Do you have something more to say?

299
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,558
No.

300
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,827
I wasn't sure what I should eat today,

301
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:33,954
so I wanted to take your suggestion.

302
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,296
Right.

303
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,824
Do you happen to like naengmyeon?

304
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:41,768
I know a decent place for it.

305
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,639
Which outfit do you think is better?

306
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:45,639
What?

307
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,541
Which one looks better on me?

308
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:53,477
Well, from the vibe I'm getting,
this one...

309
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,166
I think this is better.

310
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:00,182
Did you say naengmyeon?

311
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:01,182
Yes.

312
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,643
Text me the address of the restaurant.

313
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:10,438
And enjoy your cafeteria lunch.

314
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Yes.

315
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,276
Goodbye.

316
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,392
Come on in.

317
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,727
Please wait a moment.

318
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:31,839
Are you here alone?

319
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,570
Yes, why do you ask?

320
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,973
- Then come this way.
- Yes.

321
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,865
Take a seat here.

322
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:43,346
- Is this the only seat left?
- Yes.

323
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,751
Table 13 needs to order.

324
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,254
I'll take your order. What can I get you?

325
00:18:58,254 --> 00:18:59,701
I'd like naengmyeon.

326
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,951
Cold noodles without ice.

327
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,192
- The same for me.
- Okay.

328
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,418
It's okay, I don't need it.

329
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,024
Just leave it here.

330
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,945
I never said I don't need it.

331
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,732
I'm sorry, I thought you came together.

332
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,309
The naengmyeon here are better
without the sauce.

333
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:38,960
My goodness.

334
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,022
Just try without it.

335
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:45,225
Adding too much takes away its flavor.

336
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,808
What do you think?

337
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:58,192
It's somewhat bland but nice.

338
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,264
Less salt is good for our age.

339
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,710
Why are you assuming I'm your age?

340
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,694
A year or two difference isn't much
when you're growing old.

341
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:12,862
We're eating here alone at this time,

342
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,902
which spells out as old and lonely.

343
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:19,612
Who are you calling old?

344
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,550
I'm at least five years younger than you!

345
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:30,782
That outfit makes you look older.

346
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,831
What did you say?

347
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,709
Good heavens.

348
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,046
Hello, there.

349
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:41,046
Yes.

350
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,373
How about we team up for
the Woori City drama?

351
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:47,172
It's tempting, but I can't at the moment.

352
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,406
I'll have to take a rain check.

353
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,269
Thanks for the offer,

354
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:55,933
but I've already joined a network
for the same project.

355
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,065
I'll be competing against you.

356
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,945
You're so slow with the information.

357
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:01,343
The notice came out today,

358
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,546
but it has been discussed
internally for weeks.

359
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:07,421
Yes, I see.

360
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,609
Producer Gang.

361
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,685
Can I be honest with you?

362
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:13,817
Sure.

363
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:17,937
It's rumored that your position
at the network is uncertain.

364
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,676
So who would team with you?

365
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:23,233
What are you talking about?

366
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:27,201
People say you have lost your touch,

367
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:30,412
and that your production skills
can't be trusted.

368
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,650
And you turned down many good scripts.

369
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,133
So the writers are hesitant
to work with you.

370
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:37,917
Right...

371
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:42,723
Okay, then.

372
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:46,814
No, thank you for telling me.

373
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:13,570
If you keep dragging it out,

374
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,888
we won't even get a slot for next year.

375
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:19,477
So let's have you work it out
and reach an agreement.

376
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:21,812
Someone has to give in.

377
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:25,813
You can't even find another co-writer.

378
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,817
Boss, are you pitching for
the Woori City drama?

379
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,889
What do you mean? Woori City drama?

380
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:37,421
So when will I get to produce,
and what about Ms. Na?

381
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,572
What do you mean will happen?

382
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,067
You can produce when Ms. Na
delivers a good script.

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,151
Producer Gang, how can you do this to me?

384
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,734
While I'm slaving away,

385
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,755
you're pitching for something else?

386
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:54,148
That can't be true.

387
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:55,148
Right?

388
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,222
I'm considering it.

389
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:00,632
Producer Han started on another project...

390
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:03,320
while you kept wasting your time.

391
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,515
After all that, you might even
end up with nothing.

392
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,810
Good day.

393
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:12,802
What...

394
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:16,564
What did she say?

395
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,799
Let's see here.

396
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,012
(Customer Na Chun Woo, your sexy
nightwear has been shipped.)

397
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,035
What's this?

398
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,728
Sexy nightwear?

399
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:38,879
Customer Na Chun Woo?

400
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,266
Who is Na Chun Woo?

401
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,414
No.

402
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:58,705
You see, I was just...

403
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,756
Good grief.

404
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:06,026
That's when she took my phone.

405
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:09,618
Wait a second.

406
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,679
"Show off your sexy allure..."

407
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,401
"to your heart's content."

408
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:17,547
What an old weird pervert.

409
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:20,751
What? The battery...

410
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:22,887
Darn it.

411
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:27,148
What? This outfit makes me look old?

412
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:28,959
I can't believe that guy.

413
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,075
I don't take telemarketing calls.

414
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,374
Hello? Na Chun Woo?

415
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,092
Who is this?

416
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:47,672
Didn't you have naengmyeon
for lunch today?

417
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:49,170
Who the hell are you?

418
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,800
Have you been following me?

419
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Why would I chase an old granny?

420
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,937
I'm calling because you took
my phone by mistake.

421
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,145
What?

422
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,032
But this is my phone.

423
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:04,495
Who are you trying to fool?

424
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:09,159
Then hang up and take a good look.

425
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,096
Good grief.

426
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:15,168
What's this?

427
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:20,731
What?

428
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,784
Is he the naengmyeon creep?

429
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:35,947
People say you have lost your touch...

430
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:39,212
and that your production skills
can't be trusted.

431
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,428
And you turned down many good scripts.

432
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:44,848
So the writers are hesitant
to work with you.

433
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:50,376
Hello, Mi Rye.

434
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,276
You must be coming home from work.

435
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,382
Yes, what are you doing here?

436
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,206
I'm just observing the people.

437
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,687
- The people?
- Yes.

438
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:06,124
I hit a mental block when
cooped up at home.

439
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:08,927
So I sometimes go hiking...

440
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,412
and take the subway anywhere.

441
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:13,916
Then when it gets crowded,
I become anxious...

442
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,437
and end up rushing back home.

443
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:19,740
Working from home can do that to you.

444
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,525
Being immersed in work is great,

445
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:23,622
but also nurture your social skills.

446
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:25,948
Mi Rye!

447
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:28,622
It's here! You have to hurry!

448
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:29,660
Really? Right now?

449
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,180
- Yes.
- Hurry!

450
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,494
There won't be any if I don't go now.

451
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:36,194
Look, hold onto this for me.

452
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,197
What's going on?

453
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:40,422
The store just restocked this.
I need to get a bunch.

454
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:41,897
Let's hurry!

455
00:26:41,897 --> 00:26:43,464
- Okay.
- Let's go.

456
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:44,698
I'll be here waiting.

457
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,873
Good heavens.

458
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,528
("Love and Cooking" by Ko Mi Rye)

459
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:11,422
(Wash your hands. I'm holding a knife!)

460
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:17,710
When you are tired and lonely,

461
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,358
You should visit Woori City

462
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:25,055
The green forests are breezy cool

463
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:29,030
The coastal seas shine brilliantly

464
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,424
Let's run to Woori City

465
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:36,360
Squirrels will welcome you here

466
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,043
You have worked hard

467
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:43,571
Well done with everything

468
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:47,451
Now you can take a break

469
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:51,195
Your vacation and life can be great

470
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:54,611
Make some fond memories

471
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:59,778
And then let's begin again

472
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,258
Good job, everybody.

473
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,344
They did well.

474
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,675
I'm taking the laptop after waiting.

475
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,177
See you at home, Mi Rye.

476
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:25,601
My word, that's a relief.

477
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:36,774
Ye Ji's dad.

478
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,094
Hae Dam's mom, hello.

479
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,651
Why didn't you come yesterday?

480
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,622
There was a meetup with the moms.

481
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,668
Didn't Ye Ji tell you?

482
00:28:44,668 --> 00:28:46,500
No. What was it about?

483
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,155
It was just moms with daughters.

484
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:52,044
We shared advice on teen issues...

485
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,108
and exchanged information in the group.

486
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,597
I see. If there is another meetup,

487
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,558
please let me know about it.

488
00:28:58,558 --> 00:28:59,988
How is Ye Ji these days?

489
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,804
I heard she goes to study cafes
with Hyun Seok,

490
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,460
and they download music for each other.

491
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,929
That's what Hae Dam told me.

492
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,944
Yes, I see. Thank you.

493
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:10,922
- Enjoy your shopping.
- Yes.

494
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:20,799
I'm not ready to kiss yet,
but a light peck is okay.

495
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,258
A light peck?

496
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:27,605
No, I'm happy with just holding hands.

497
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:28,746
For real.

498
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,744
This much is okay.

499
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:35,313
Ye Ji...

500
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,613
What's the matter?

501
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,585
Why that woman of all people?

502
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,777
This drives me nuts.

503
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,176
Wait a minute.

504
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,811
Why should I be the one running away?

505
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:05,389
Kids these days sure rush into things.

506
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,976
- Look, here lady!
- My goodness!

507
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,701
What do you want?

508
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,760
What concept is that?

509
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,257
Are you playing shy or innocent?

510
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:17,266
Shy?

511
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:18,530
Innocent?

512
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:20,888
You saw what happened.

513
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:24,472
Yes, I did see it. So what?

514
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:26,321
Just don't tell my dad.

515
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:29,159
Why would I tell him such a thing?

516
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,827
Such a thing?

517
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,570
I can't believe you adults.

518
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,508
Then why are you telling me
not to tell your dad?

519
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:39,043
He is a stick in the mud.

520
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:40,156
It shouldn't be a big deal,

521
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:43,284
but he could overreact
after hearing it from you.

522
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,843
I don't want to cause an issue.

523
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,932
So let's pretend you didn't see it.

524
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,653
Doesn't that laptop belong to Aunt Mi Rye?

525
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:57,782
Right.

526
00:30:57,782 --> 00:30:59,926
So why do you have it?

527
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,445
She asked me to hold onto it.

528
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,013
Then give it to me.

529
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,513
No, she can pick it up herself.

530
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:10,194
Anyway, are you going to
keep what you saw a secret or what?

531
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:11,255
Keep it a secret?

532
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:16,158
Then what do I get in return?

533
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,253
You're so sneaky.

534
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,114
What do you want from me?

535
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,521
Thank you.

536
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:32,238
Mi Rye.

537
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:35,598
How about you work with me?

538
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:39,313
What do you mean?

539
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,909
Why don't we take your webtoon...

540
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:45,025
and turn it into a drama on the network?

541
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,026
Me?

542
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:50,015
No, I can't write a drama.

543
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:52,265
The process went backwards last time,

544
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:55,723
but you had your work out there.

545
00:31:57,107 --> 00:32:00,982
Actually, I saw your latest work
on the laptop earlier.

546
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:04,006
What? But it's not ready to be seen.

547
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:07,352
I've only recently started drawing it.

548
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:09,164
It was quite entertaining.

549
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:11,903
I'm offering you a proposition here.

550
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:14,822
No, I can't.

551
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:17,638
Then I'll have to talk with people,

552
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:21,805
hold meetings, compromise,
interact, and all that.

553
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:23,285
That's right.

554
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:26,583
It's a great chance to improve
your social skills.

555
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,020
Don't just be nervous,

556
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,925
but think it over and decide.

557
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:34,977
Decide again?

558
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,545
No, I won't be doing it.

559
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,617
Anyway, thank you.

560
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,261
Good grief.

561
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:54,138
Aunt Mi Rye, I'm coming in.

562
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,138
Sure.

563
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,714
Goodness, you're always cooped up in here.

564
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:06,386
Why are you suddenly on my back?

565
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,077
Who me?

566
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:11,940
Shouldn't you look for a real job?

567
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:14,761
Are you saying I'm slacking off?

568
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,770
I know you're making a great effort,

569
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,737
but effort alone doesn't cut it.

570
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:23,755
You need luck and the right people
to give you a chance.

571
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,187
What? What have you heard?

572
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,113
Why would I have heard anything?

573
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:32,783
They say life presents three big chances.

574
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,017
You don't have much time left.

575
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:36,640
What did you say?

576
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,528
Not much time is left, is there?

577
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:40,528
Look.

578
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,972
Wait, if there are three chances left,
how many are left?

579
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:47,732
Darn it.

580
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,042
I just talked to Aunt Mi Rye.

581
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,993
I'll get her around to work with you.

582
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:56,995
So keep my secret from Dad, okay?

583
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:08,789
You're home.

584
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,181
Look, I have something to ask.

585
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:17,399
The cherry tomato leaves are wilting.

586
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,537
I can't figure it out.

587
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:25,798
What?

588
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:29,622
Good grief, it's an aphid problem
limited to this part.

589
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:31,109
Aphid?

590
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:32,890
Then are they going to die?

591
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,198
They can be saved.

592
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:39,510
You can just spray some water
mixed with vinegar.

593
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,615
Water with vinegar?

594
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:42,568
How much?

595
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,623
Wait here for a moment.

596
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,317
- Sang Sik.
- Hey.

597
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:51,933
You're out here as well.

598
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:52,998
What do you have there?

599
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:56,151
This is mine, and this is for Min Ju.

600
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:58,719
What for?

601
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,717
What for? to wear it together, of course.

602
00:35:00,717 --> 00:35:02,895
It's for the motorbike and skateboard.

603
00:35:03,773 --> 00:35:06,631
My word, it would look good on you.

604
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,625
What do you think? Do you like it?

605
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:21,680
Ye Ji.

606
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,352
Ye Ji, open the door.

607
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,482
Ko Ye Ji.

608
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,136
Ko Ye Ji!

609
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,773
What? I couldn't hear over the music.

610
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:33,773
Well.

611
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,310
Why is your door locked?

612
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,625
I want to be alone sometimes,
and not be disturbed.

613
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:42,646
Were you on the phone?

614
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:43,646
No.

615
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,803
Are you going to keep me standing here?

616
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:48,850
What do you want?

617
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:53,205
Well, is everything okay?

618
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:54,311
Like what?

619
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,455
Are your friends giving you a hard time?

620
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,885
No.

621
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:02,133
Dad, I was texting my friends
about important stuff.

622
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,667
So what's important?

623
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,968
Seriously.

624
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:08,413
Okay, I get it.

625
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:11,605
Just know that you can always
talk to me, okay?

626
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:13,230
- Okay.
- All right.

627
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:49,643
What's going on this late?

628
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:56,317
Good heavens, that woke me up.

629
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,535
Who's there?

630
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,343
Wait.

631
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm a family member here.

632
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,668
Who are you trying to fool?

633
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,433
Look, there is someone here!

634
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:36,199
Wait!

635
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:40,065
I'm the brother-in-law of this family.

636
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:42,626
Then we can go inside and check.

637
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,474
Ko Sang Sik!

638
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:47,609
Look, please.

639
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:49,708
Please be quiet.

640
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:53,409
- My word, Ms. Producer.
- Dad.

641
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,427
Sweetheart.

642
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,804
Good grief.

643
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:03,010
I should have given you a heads-up.

644
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,049
I'm really sorry we startled you.

645
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:08,926
It really gave me a scare.

646
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:11,853
Just bear with us for tonight.

647
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:14,684
Everyone will know by tomorrow morning.

648
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:17,365
I don't get what you're saying.

649
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,278
What's all this commotion at night?

650
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:22,582
My brother won't kick me out
once we pitch the tent.

651
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:25,041
What tent?

652
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:30,859
My bad.

653
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:32,945
I told you to be careful.

654
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:35,820
We still got it done.

655
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,731
Do we have to do this every summer?

656
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,921
The other kids go on vacations
abroad and what else,

657
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,708
and they have a great time.

658
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,928
But Mom lets her friends rent
our house for money.

659
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,268
Hun, don't talk like that.

660
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:51,747
This is only for two weeks.

661
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,188
It's all about making family memories,

662
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:56,163
so think positively.

663
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:58,522
All right, that's enough nagging
out of you.

664
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:00,419
Make the bedding now. I'm sleepy.

665
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:01,491
I'm tired too, Mom.

666
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:02,790
All right.

667
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:08,124
Good grief, mosquitoes.
Is there any repellent?

668
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:09,124
What?

669
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:22,459
Look, Ms. Producer.

670
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:29,542
Sorry to wake you.
Despite bringing a lot of stuff,

671
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,461
I forgot our mosquito repellent.

672
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,943
Do you happen to have any?

673
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:40,224
Thank you. Have a good night.

674
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:46,785
Excuse me, Ms. Producer.

675
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:50,457
Ms. Producer.

676
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,853
Hello, I'm Park Hun.

677
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,541
I'm sorry, but can I get some water?

678
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,322
I won't forget this favor.

679
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,091
Look, excuse me.

680
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,616
I'm sorry to bother you.

681
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,664
I must have drank a lot of water...

682
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,276
because I really have to go.

683
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,826
What's this?

684
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:42,787
Ko Sang Hee.

685
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,443
Ko Sang Hee!

686
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:49,854
What?

687
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:51,631
Why are you...

688
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:57,425
- My back hurts.
- What?

689
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:58,816
Why are you coming from there?

690
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:02,137
You see, last night...

691
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:04,465
We kept going back and forth...

692
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:06,192
So she offered her place.

693
00:41:06,192 --> 00:41:07,192
What?

694
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:12,338
Did you sleep out here?

695
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:13,542
Isn't that obvious?

696
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,580
You let them stay at your house?

697
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,294
Yes, that's what happened.

698
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:19,932
Why would you do such a thing?

699
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:21,989
Last night, you see...

700
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:23,030
There was no other way...

701
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,685
Sang Sik, don't yell at our neighbor.

702
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:26,808
You!

703
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:28,305
I'll leave you to it.

704
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:30,312
Since you let us crash at your place,

705
00:41:30,312 --> 00:41:31,826
I'll make you breakfast.

706
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:35,396
That's okay. I didn't get any sleep.

707
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,907
Everyone in the house.

708
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:37,925
Now!

709
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:42,316
See? He told everyone to come.

710
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:44,435
Yes, let's get inside.

711
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,724
No, I...

712
00:41:45,724 --> 00:41:46,847
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

713
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,614
This is a bit awkward.

714
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,351
Come on, let's dig in.

715
00:41:58,198 --> 00:41:59,421
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

716
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:00,421
Anyway,

717
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:04,034
I'm sorry my thoughtless family
troubled you.

718
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:08,690
Well, I did move here for some quiet.

719
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,454
Are you sure this is everyone?

720
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,642
It appears so,

721
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:16,157
but there might be more lurking.

722
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,849
That's so funny.

723
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,359
This is everyone in our family.

724
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,918
After breakfast, take your tent back home.

725
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,341
I need to get to work.

726
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:28,799
My friends are only staying for a week.

727
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,695
Help me make some allowance money.

728
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,183
Finding a place is too expensive,

729
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,263
and their kids are excited to come.

730
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,286
But you even troubled our neighbor.

731
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,359
- Are you out of your mind?
- See?

732
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:40,194
I told you we'd get kicked out.

733
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:41,226
- Son.
- Hun.

734
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,621
What are neighbors for?

735
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:46,294
- Right, Mi Rye?
- What?

736
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:48,421
Why are you asking me?

737
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,431
I hear Aunt Mi Rye might start
working at the network.

738
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:56,703
Really?

739
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,056
Is that true?

740
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:00,783
No.

741
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:03,354
Nothing is decided.

742
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:06,135
What is she talking about?

743
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:08,582
I made her an offer.

744
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:11,129
To work together at the network.

745
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:13,352
That won't happen.

746
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:15,311
Why is that, Dad?

747
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:16,510
I said no.

748
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,705
She would get hurt in such a place.

749
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,030
Such a place?

750
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,906
And what makes you say that?

751
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:24,463
With viewer ratings and ads,

752
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:26,911
it's the epitome of capitalism.

753
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:29,719
Mi Rye is purely engaged in
her creative work,

754
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:32,132
so it would be more than
distressing there.

755
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:35,659
On what grounds are you saying this?

756
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:38,331
My family doesn't care or enjoy...

757
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,196
broadcasting networks and dramas.

758
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:43,008
- I love dramas.
- Me, too.

759
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:47,456
But you can also get by
without watching any.

760
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:49,361
- Isn't that right?
- What?

761
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:50,368
Yes, sure.

762
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,857
My family doesn't watch dramas at home.

763
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:56,218
I watch the news, Hun plays games,
and Sang Hee does home shopping.

764
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,753
She is a lost cause.

765
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:01,632
We're the reason for this.

766
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:04,808
Since we have our neighbor over,

767
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,895
let's talk about food, hobbies,
and even ideal types.

768
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,852
That would be more fun.

769
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:10,552
My ideal type?

770
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:12,409
There is a man oblivious about his family,

771
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:16,594
but is overbearing and stubborn
when it comes to them.

772
00:44:16,594 --> 00:44:18,556
Just anyone but him.

773
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,643
For me, women who live alone...

774
00:44:20,643 --> 00:44:23,909
without any consideration of others
are the most despicable.

775
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:30,645
You'll have to excuse me.

776
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:33,346
Why are you acting this way?

777
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,759
- Please don't go like that.
- Take your seats.

778
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:36,980
Sit and eat your food.

779
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:41,298
I let his family crash at my place,

780
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:43,401
but he slandered my job.

781
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:47,259
What's with the viewer ratings and ads?

782
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:50,316
My stomach hurts.

783
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:53,732
Why does it hurt again?

784
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,479
All this stress.

785
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:59,051
My goodness.

786
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:09,708
What's the big news?

787
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:13,306
Out with it already.

788
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:18,029
Good word, what's with her?

789
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:20,963
You know what?

790
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:24,338
My period is back.

791
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:28,127
It wasn't menopausal, just irregular.

792
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:30,521
Really?

793
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:32,211
That was well done!

794
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:37,649
See? I told you to get it checked.

795
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:39,152
Between menopause and irregular cycles,

796
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:41,644
are you going back and forth as
a woman and just human?

797
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:46,825
Here is to becoming a woman again.

798
00:45:46,825 --> 00:45:47,897
Cheers.

799
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:48,897
Thanks.

800
00:45:50,593 --> 00:45:53,432
- You should thank the skateboard.
- What skateboard?

801
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,352
Jun Woo taught me how to ride it.

802
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,745
But did you ask him about her?

803
00:45:57,745 --> 00:46:00,000
That woman I saw him with.

804
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,280
Why are you ruining it for the couple?

805
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,498
He probably lent her money.

806
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:07,337
The mood wasn't like that.

807
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:09,465
I don't feel comfortable asking him.

808
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:10,904
I'm not even his girlfriend.

809
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,169
But he said it's Day One.

810
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,953
I know, but she didn't even get that.

811
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:16,386
It's like speaking to a wall.

812
00:46:16,386 --> 00:46:18,913
Yes, I'm old and out of touch.

813
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:21,043
That's how they treat me at work.

814
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:24,669
What is it now?

815
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:33,306
As long you land this Woori City project,

816
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:37,746
we can all escape from the Planning Team.

817
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:41,116
But how will you find a writer?

818
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,055
There is Na Ae Ri.

819
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:45,780
Are you going to work with her?

820
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,616
There is one more,
but I will find out about her today.

821
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:50,640
- But before that...
- Yes?

822
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,905
The writers are inexperienced,
so I need a good cast.

823
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:55,010
What actors are there?

824
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,333
Mr. Wook already has another
drama scheduled.

825
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:01,723
Joo Yeon.

826
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:04,100
You cannot mean Na Joo Yeon!

827
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,619
Yes, why?

828
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:08,619
Why would she even do this?

829
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:10,559
Let's hope she is loyal.

830
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,605
Cut. Let's take five.

831
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:32,799
Hand me my phone.

832
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:37,291
My word, Producer Gang.

833
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,756
How are you?

834
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,959
It's the same old routine for me.

835
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:45,026
You sure are a star with so many ads.

836
00:47:45,026 --> 00:47:46,291
Nonsense.

837
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,187
It's a struggle competing with new faces.

838
00:47:49,187 --> 00:47:50,895
But you're still on top.

839
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:54,436
Have a seat.

840
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:56,483
No, you sit down.

841
00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:57,495
Okay.

842
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,278
What brings you all this way?

843
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,419
Well, you see...

844
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:08,608
It's like this.

845
00:48:08,608 --> 00:48:10,807
There is a drama in the works.

846
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,872
I think you should hear about it.

847
00:48:13,872 --> 00:48:15,159
When do you have time?

848
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:18,687
Is that why you came and waited?

849
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:21,036
Why not just call me?

850
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:23,164
I did, but you didn't answer.

851
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:24,660
Really?

852
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,895
I didn't know because
your number wasn't saved.

853
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:31,215
Is it because of the Woori City drama?

854
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:35,301
Did you already hear from others?

855
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:37,179
Of course.

856
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:40,831
They kept calling, trying to get
what they couldn't have.

857
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:45,224
Are you just not interested?

858
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:49,176
I would consider it out of
respect for you.

859
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:52,516
But Producer Gang,

860
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,781
you should think of your age.

861
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,890
There need to be current trends.

862
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,654
So how could yours get picked?

863
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:05,683
What do you mean? I still have it.

864
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:06,808
I'm all right.

865
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:12,065
That's when you were in your heyday.

866
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:14,204
Just like I'm no longer
a rookie actress...

867
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,790
who cried when I was told off.

868
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,370
And dramas can be draining.

869
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,046
So I'll stick with movies for a while.

870
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:27,068
You still have that attitude.

871
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:29,045
What did you say?

872
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:30,999
Don't you wonder
why you have so many haters?

873
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,893
It's because of your mouth.

874
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:37,400
A slip of the tongue could kill
your career in showbiz.

875
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,596
If you want to keep going,

876
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:42,292
don't think about fixing your face,

877
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:43,592
but work on your mouth.

878
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:50,188
My word, I'm speechless.

879
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:52,254
Why tick me off after coming all this way?

880
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,870
Stop that!

881
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:57,110
You guys worked hard.

882
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,172
All right.

883
00:49:58,172 --> 00:49:59,732
Chief Ko, you're two left feet.

884
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:01,964
How could you miss the beat?

885
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:04,556
Can't you make this move?

886
00:50:04,556 --> 00:50:06,580
Just like this.

887
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,819
I guess it's your age.

888
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:09,823
What?

889
00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:11,436
Why are you teasing him?

890
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:14,681
Chief Ko was the cutest like the squirrel.

891
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,850
Ms. Han, you did great with the song.

892
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,569
This is the least I can do.

893
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:20,897
Let's practice more before uploading...

894
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,001
and see what response we get.

895
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,364
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

896
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:37,547
Mi Rye.

897
00:50:38,194 --> 00:50:39,884
Yes, hello.

898
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:43,234
It must have been a hard decision.

899
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:45,202
Thank you for coming.

900
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:47,714
No, I appreciate it.

901
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,170
Let's talk inside.

902
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,500
Wait.

903
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,885
I'll tell you now and leave.

904
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,849
After putting in a lot of thought,

905
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:00,637
it would be best that I don't.

906
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:02,237
If it's because of your brother...

907
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:03,396
No.

908
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:06,047
I don't want to bother him
because of my needs.

909
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,497
What are you talking about?

910
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,726
You should give me a valid reason.

911
00:51:13,726 --> 00:51:15,542
The thing is,

912
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:19,921
my brother had some incident
with the network.

913
00:51:21,374 --> 00:51:22,769
What do you mean by an incident?

914
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:26,743
Well, you see...

915
00:51:27,846 --> 00:51:32,072
It's something he doesn't
want to remember...

916
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:37,318
Are you saying that because of the past,

917
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:41,705
he is against you working at the network?

918
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:48,702
This is really frustrating.

919
00:51:48,702 --> 00:51:52,258
Anyway, you heard me, so I'll go now.

920
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,258
Mi Rye.

921
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,899
Mi Rye.

922
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:10,273
Are you back from work?

923
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:11,313
Yes.

924
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,122
Has your brother gotten back?

925
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:14,369
Yes, just now.

926
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:16,274
Where can I find him?

927
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:19,162
Over there.

928
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:20,804
Up there.

929
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,404
What's with this room?

930
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:41,121
How did you get in here?

931
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:43,497
The door was open.

932
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:46,647
You have an impressive collection
of albums and movies.

933
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:49,059
It's my personal space. Please leave.

934
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,872
I have something to talk about.

935
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:55,993
I apologize for what I said.

936
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:58,833
I didn't mean to belittle your profession,

937
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:02,429
but I have no intention of Mi Rye
working at the network.

938
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,253
She hates interacting with people...

939
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:07,144
and hasn't been out in the world.

940
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:10,024
Mi Rye came to meet me at the network.

941
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:14,629
She wants to give it a try...

942
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:16,482
but can't out of fear
because of her concern for you.

943
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:19,598
I have already warned you.

944
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:22,357
Keep my family out of your business,

945
00:53:22,357 --> 00:53:24,090
and stay away from them.

946
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:28,558
I don't know what happened before,

947
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:30,142
but you're living in the past,

948
00:53:30,142 --> 00:53:32,209
and it's dragging your family with you.

949
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,850
I don't know what Mi Rye told you,

950
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,892
but mind your own business
and focus on yourself.

951
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,037
Is being the family head everything?

952
00:53:40,665 --> 00:53:43,649
You use it as an excuse to keep
them from everything...

953
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:46,261
while you can't get enough
space to yourself.

954
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,259
What do you know to speak that way?

955
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,809
It looks like you think highly
of yourself.

956
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:54,327
Do you actually believe that
you're so capable?

957
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:55,327
What?

958
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,042
Who are you to give Mi Rye a chance?

959
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,634
She said she doesn't need it.

960
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:00,651
You're so uptight.

961
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,258
Are you happy that way?

962
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:03,963
Wishing nothing would happen,

963
00:54:03,963 --> 00:54:06,058
you overreact when something does.

964
00:54:06,058 --> 00:54:07,987
Is that why you've behaved that way...

965
00:54:09,535 --> 00:54:11,051
and acted harshly to me?

966
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:14,424
That's nonsense. Leave now.

967
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:16,301
- Ko Sang Sik.
- Get out.

968
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,475
Fine, you can keep living this way.

969
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:21,827
With family in your arms,

970
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:24,570
give up everything in your life
to live in the past.

971
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:25,851
What did you say?

972
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:28,141
If you keep on this way
putting yourself first,

973
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:30,654
there won't be anyone left next to you,

974
00:54:30,654 --> 00:54:32,037
like there isn't anyone now.

975
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,302
Hee Su.

976
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:46,415
Hee Su.

977
00:55:50,377 --> 00:55:51,933
Hee Su, wake up.

978
00:55:52,964 --> 00:55:54,020
Hee Su.

979
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:56,133
Hee Su, wake up!

980
00:55:56,794 --> 00:55:57,844
Hee Su.

981
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,389
Hee Su, I'm sorry.

982
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:04,254
I'm sorry for being late.

983
00:56:05,076 --> 00:56:07,391
I'm sorry for being late, Hee Su.

984
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:08,590
Wake up.

985
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,378
Open your eyes, Hee Su!

986
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,017
Hee Su.

987
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:16,248
Hee Su!

988
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:21,147
I'm sorry...

989
00:57:23,863 --> 00:57:26,441
It looks like you think
highly of yourself.

990
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,736
Do you actually believe that
you're so capable?

991
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,080
If you keep on this way
putting yourself first,

992
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,542
there won't be anyone left next to you,

993
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,130
like there isn't anyone now.

994
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:49,771
Min Ju, where are you?

995
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:54,747
I'm still out. Why?

996
00:57:55,768 --> 00:57:57,420
Your light wasn't on yet.

997
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,856
I got worried since it got late,
and decided to call.

998
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:05,490
Now I have someone worrying about me.

999
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,138
Of course.

1000
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:09,186
Why does your voice sound so depressed?

1001
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,405
Is something wrong?

1002
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:15,036
There must be since you won't answer.

1003
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,851
I don't know what's going on,
but hang in there.

1004
00:58:19,851 --> 00:58:21,063
Gang Min Ju, be strong!

1005
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:34,077
(Green Forest Study Cafe)

1006
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:41,033
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1007
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:44,615
Where can I find Ko Ye Ji's spot?

1008
00:58:44,615 --> 00:58:45,658
Wait a moment.

1009
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,499
Ko Ye Ji.

1010
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:51,126
What? She didn't come today.

1011
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:02,979
Ye Ji, where are you?

1012
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:04,568
I'm at the study cafe.

1013
00:59:05,964 --> 00:59:07,978
Right, I see.

1014
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:08,996
Why?

1015
00:59:09,442 --> 00:59:11,947
I got worried since you said
that you'd be late.

1016
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:14,707
Dad, I'll be out studying a bit more.

1017
00:59:14,707 --> 00:59:16,428
Don't worry, and go to bed.

1018
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,645
- Hanging up.
- Ye Ji, wait a minute.

1019
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:36,891
Hi, Mom.

1020
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:40,315
Min Ju, can you talk right now?

1021
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:43,537
Sure. What's wrong with your voice?

1022
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:45,233
Is something wrong?

1023
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:48,805
No, I was just thinking of you.

1024
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,370
Mom, are you crying?

1025
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:53,554
No.

1026
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,347
Come on, what's wrong?

1027
00:59:56,919 --> 01:00:00,561
Your dad is starting to forget things.

1028
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,379
He got it checked, but...

1029
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:04,685
Never mind.

1030
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:08,080
Are you saying it's dementia?

1031
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,711
No.

1032
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:12,142
Your dad isn't that weak.

1033
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,517
Everyone forgets things in old age.

1034
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:16,716
The result will be out in a few days.

1035
01:00:20,938 --> 01:00:22,948
At least I'm healthy.

1036
01:00:23,658 --> 01:00:26,695
This is why you need someone
in your old age.

1037
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:30,154
Can you come here, or should I go?

1038
01:00:30,154 --> 01:00:31,458
No.

1039
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,850
Why waste money going back and forth?

1040
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:35,539
You just take care of yourself.

1041
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:39,545
Mom, I'm doing well,
so don't be stressed about money.

1042
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:42,188
I've worked hard all those years.

1043
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,644
And I'll keep getting paid.

1044
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:50,476
All right.

1045
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:54,502
Don't worry, it won't be dementia.

1046
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:57,284
Okay.

1047
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:00,164
Talk to you later.

1048
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:11,314
What have I run for all this time?

1049
01:01:17,327 --> 01:01:21,289
I thought this life would be the answer.

1050
01:01:36,374 --> 01:01:39,771
But I'm left with shabby wounds.

1051
01:01:51,045 --> 01:01:52,375
Are you badly hurt? Let me see.

1052
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,138
Don't worry. I'm okay.

1053
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,048
Here.

1054
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:02,539
Just leave me alone.

1055
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,567
Since becoming an adult,

1056
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,840
I can't say it's painful anymore.

1057
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:34,348
It's because I have to run again
when tomorrow comes.

1058
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:01,823
No, you don't have to take strength.

1059
01:03:04,315 --> 01:03:05,868
It's okay to take a break.

1060
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:13,926
Don't do anything for now.

1061
01:03:13,926 --> 01:03:15,407
That's okay.

1062
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:53,117
(Second to Last Love)

1063
01:03:54,891 --> 01:03:56,723
Are you sure nothing happened?

1064
01:03:56,723 --> 01:03:57,883
Why would there be?

1065
01:03:57,883 --> 01:03:59,011
That's good to know.

1066
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:00,674
Good? Good to know?

1067
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,954
My brother isn't like that.

1068
01:04:02,954 --> 01:04:04,179
Ko Mi Rye disappeared.

1069
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:06,092
She took everything she owned.

1070
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,594
What accident?

1071
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,628
The emergency room?

1072
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:10,628
