1
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:16,241
I must make it hard for you.

2
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,265
I want you to be happy, Ko Sang Sik.

3
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:44,833
If you consider me for a tiny bit,

4
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,104
you could let go of the past.

5
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,084
I thought it was behind me, but...

6
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,399
Okay, then.

7
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:54,737
We can bury our past for each other.

8
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:57,898
I can't look at you...

9
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,411
as if nothing happened.

10
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,713
I came here to be happy.

11
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:13,670
And there were such moments.

12
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,130
But for his sake,

13
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,499
I realize that I can't stay here.

14
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:24,119
(Second to Last Love)

15
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,029
(Episode 14)

16
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,764
What? What's happened?

17
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:39,139
She packed her stuff and left.

18
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,524
Didn't she reach out to you?

19
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,284
To me? Why would she?

20
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,419
It was you who signed the lease.

21
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,785
You're right. Hold on.

22
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,539
My word.

23
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:54,453
I'm sorry for not saying goodbye.

24
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,362
I'll contact you later.

25
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,138
I didn't know she had texted.

26
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,210
Where were you when she left?

27
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,926
We were at the stable because
Honey has been unwell.

28
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:08,016
Did you give him the bracelets?

29
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,410
Right, here.

30
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,323
Why do you have them?

31
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:19,158
I was cleaning out your desk...

32
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,649
and found out that she left it there.

33
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:25,229
Why didn't you give it back sooner?

34
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:35,520
So you packed your things and left?

35
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
Yes.

36
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,631
What about your other stuff?

37
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,114
There is a storage place you can rent.

38
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,470
Unbelievable.

39
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,590
I don't mind having you crash here,

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,642
but why would you run like a fugitive?

41
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,230
I don't know.

42
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,730
Do you know what this looks like?

43
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:03,408
It's like you're a newlywed...

44
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,629
who came running from your first fight.

45
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,842
- What?
- You left Jun Woo...

46
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,354
and poured out your feelings.

47
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:13,189
So why are you running away
instead of being happy?

48
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,968
I didn't run away, he did.

49
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:20,743
I feel sorry for the guy.

50
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,159
Life isn't that long.

51
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,760
So why live miserably because of his past?

52
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,836
Solve the next question on your own.

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,276
It's already autumn.

54
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,975
We broke up.

55
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,795
Ye Ji, I know a great study cafe.

56
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:11,134
Would you like to go with me?

57
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,455
Don't text during class.

58
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,846
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

59
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,691
You guys, it's not speed that counts.

60
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,235
You should be on point.

61
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,099
The same goes for life.

62
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,378
It's not about going faster,

63
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,801
but knowing where you're headed.

64
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,392
Have that sense of direction.

65
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:54,519
Mr. Park, I need the bathroom.

66
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,416
Mr. Park, I need the snack bar.

67
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,089
I'm hungry.

68
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,258
Goodness.

69
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:02,783
Whose turn is it for parent speaker day?

70
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:04,245
- Ye Ji.
- Ye Ji.

71
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,668
Ask someone to come in next time.

72
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:08,760
Okay.

73
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:12,943
Don't you think this is a better spot?

74
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,044
You're right.

75
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:18,621
The place has great facilities,
but isn't widely known yet.

76
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,439
It could be a dating spot in the drama.

77
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,727
- Right.
- Then it's settled.

78
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,385
Let's hope it brings in more tourists.

79
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,296
- Chief Ko.
- Yes?

80
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:30,361
(Chief Ko, hang in there)

81
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,506
Are you feeling unwell?

82
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,701
It's nothing.

83
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,773
So which spot should we go with?

84
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,133
Something is really up with you.

85
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,384
Chief Ko.

86
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,357
Is this how you handle your work?

87
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:54,265
You must have some connection
with Producer Gang...

88
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,419
to take her there and mess it up.

89
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,419
What connection?

90
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,752
Why show her a non-operating ferry...

91
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,648
to create such a mess?

92
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,319
The city promised active support
to the production teams...

93
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,177
that were competing for the drama.

94
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,192
Active support?

95
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,904
You should have kicked out
the troublemakers...

96
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,898
and even canceled their win.

97
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,961
As for the ferry,

98
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,080
I assigned you to make it float.

99
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Exactly.

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,920
Despite using the taxpayers' money
with a reckless budget,

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,584
there were shoddy repairs, a collusion,
and more to investigate.

102
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,000
What did you say?

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,920
Are you saying it was because
of botched repairs?

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,056
A contractor is working on it,

105
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:34,577
so look forward to how my team
promotes and handles it.

106
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,944
What if you waste this investment?

107
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:40,255
Then there won't be a drama to produce,

108
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,991
and you won't keep your job.

109
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,218
Keep that in mind.

110
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:52,403
Boss.

111
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,360
- Boss.
- There you are.

112
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,618
What happened? Why did you move out?

113
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:02,059
Well, it just happened.

114
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,949
We were so worried.

115
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,019
Who?

116
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,974
My brother and the entire family.

117
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,395
I'm grateful.

118
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:14,281
I mean, where are you staying?

119
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,139
Let's go in.

120
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,136
- Producer Gang, congratulations.
- Thank you.

121
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,295
Hello.

122
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,222
We got the Woori City Drama.

123
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,772
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:38,491
You don't seem to know this industry.

125
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,880
Productions could get put on hold...

126
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,856
or not get aired despite all the work.

127
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,872
Okay. I'll work hard.

128
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,227
I hope you enjoy our drama.

129
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,138
Does she get what I said?

130
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,146
The girl should leave at this point.

131
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:59,065
- Leave?
- Why?

132
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,005
How could she not in this case?

133
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,991
But that wouldn't be true love.

134
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,431
Exactly. Why would the girl leave
if she wants to stay?

135
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,885
But it doesn't add up for them.

136
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,012
They could be feeling awkward and uneasy,

137
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,663
but it's all in the past now.

138
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,181
Why would that be a problem?

139
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,084
Shouldn't their bond grow deeper?

140
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:20,830
The guy can't bear looking at her.

141
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,382
So what choice does she have?

142
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:24,919
I wouldn't leave.

143
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,141
They should face it together.

144
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:32,016
That's real love, and it's what he needs.

145
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,634
Why can't you see my point?

146
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:40,237
Are all young people like this?
Am I being lame?

147
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,164
Jun.

148
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,683
Do you work here now?

149
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,352
Yes.

150
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,974
Right, I see.

151
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,471
I heard about Min Ju.

152
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:04,471
Yes.

153
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,086
It must have been hard.

154
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,844
No, I'm okay.

155
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:11,137
- What about you?
- I've recovered.

156
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,059
And my feelings are getting better.

157
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:15,775
Yes, that's good.

158
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,625
I've been working hard as a model,

159
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,982
and I take acting lessons.

160
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:22,391
Really? That's great.

161
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,339
Gang Min Ju set me up with it.

162
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,994
It's a first for me to love something
other than you.

163
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,064
I see.

164
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,530
Min Ju is better for you than me.

165
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,202
You're still a good person to me.

166
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,271
I know.

167
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,945
Okay. Good.

168
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:48,362
All right.

169
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,234
The press conference is in two days.

170
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:53,362
How can the male lead quit?
That's ridiculous.

171
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,922
We'll have to convince him.

172
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,883
There is even this poster shoot.

173
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,043
- It won't work.
- What?

174
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:02,528
He's in a legal battle against
his former agency.

175
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,233
And being a rookie actor,

176
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,281
he seems to lack confidence
against Na Joo Yeon.

177
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,462
Wait a minute.

178
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,045
Look at the time.

179
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,873
Why isn't he here yet?

180
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,793
What now? There isn't time.

181
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,741
How about Mr. Wook?

182
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,798
He's preparing for another drama.

183
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:22,764
I know the drama's director.

184
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:24,925
He called to vent about Mr. Wook,

185
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:27,577
saying it would do well to replace him.

186
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:28,682
Seriously?

187
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,320
Figures. Only you can handle him.

188
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,199
But how do we convince the actor?

189
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,398
We need what he wants.

190
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:38,417
There might be something like that.

191
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,771
PR ambassador of Woori City.

192
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,154
Right.

193
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,304
Woori City's PR ambassador?

194
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:49,855
With a city drama underway,

195
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:53,503
shouldn't we have a new face
that represents the city?

196
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:54,923
I see.

197
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,562
How about Mr. Wook?

198
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,651
Do you mean from the grape festival?

199
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:02,332
He helped us manage the grape crisis.

200
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,799
Yes, all the farmers are grateful.

201
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,258
Mr. Wook can be our lead in the drama,

202
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,739
and serve as our PR ambassador.

203
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,526
But is that feasible?

204
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,978
Whose idea was this?

205
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:17,408
Producer Gang suggested it, of course.

206
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:21,253
You two make a great team.

207
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,239
Why don't you make a move on it?

208
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:26,424
Now excuse me, I have a date planned.

209
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,329
Ta-da.

210
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,241
I'm here.

211
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,296
You should come on time.

212
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,950
I was here ten minutes before.

213
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,097
What? Then why are you late?

214
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:11,998
I watched you from over there.

215
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,607
My word, really?

216
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,686
I can't believe you did that.

217
00:14:20,348 --> 00:14:21,859
Why does that matter?

218
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,646
I found you very lovely.

219
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:29,870
I came early to capture the moment...

220
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,855
when you are waiting here for me.

221
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,305
Goodness, you're making me blush.

222
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,242
Isn't it nice? The Wind Hill.

223
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,148
Like those pinwheels there,

224
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,558
people might appear glamorous.

225
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:48,334
But we all come like the wind...

226
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:51,197
and disappear like morning dew.

227
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:53,337
We don't have much time left,

228
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,279
so don't go home tonight.

229
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,497
What?

230
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,571
Spend the night with me.

231
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,378
My goodness.

232
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:04,741
What are you saying?

233
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:09,099
Goodness me.

234
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,059
People are staring. Stop that.

235
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,349
They must be jealous.

236
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:17,757
My word.

237
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:21,148
With all of you here today,

238
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:24,764
we're honored to have Mr. Wook
deliver his special lecture.

239
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:30,516
Let's hear about his journey
in life as an actor...

240
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:32,340
and give him a warm welcome.

241
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:48,142
I have everything I need.

242
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,275
There is air that I can breathe...

243
00:15:56,275 --> 00:16:00,374
and passion that fuels my dream.

244
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:02,970
But most importantly,

245
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,472
every day is unpredictable...

246
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:11,983
Since each day is unpredictable...

247
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:17,213
In this unpredictable life...

248
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:19,963
You don't know who you'll meet
or where you'll end up?

249
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:21,502
Yes, bingo.

250
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:24,954
Life is a gift, so don't waste it.

251
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,680
You don't know what hand
you'll get dealt next,

252
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,848
so take life as it comes at you...

253
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,719
to make each day count.

254
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,321
Make it count.

255
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,898
Titanic.

256
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,528
Bingo.

257
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,607
It's a quote from "Titanic."

258
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:43,857
Give him applause.

259
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,561
What's he doing here?

260
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,811
There is Mr. Wook!

261
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,888
You must have wheels on your feet.

262
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,312
Are you on board with it?

263
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,424
I'll think about it.

264
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,702
There isn't time. You have to decide.

265
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:07,335
The grape festival improved your image.

266
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,289
You could even be the PR ambassador.

267
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,002
Okay, I'll think about it.

268
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,617
Why did he come here?

269
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:22,920
Did he already leave?

270
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,282
Wait a minute.

271
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,651
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,517
- You're the Titanic guy.
- Yes.

273
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,437
Here.

274
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,632
What's this?

275
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,025
Take a look at it on your way.
You'll like it.

276
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,167
And if you do, please contact me.

277
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:53,693
Okay.

278
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,765
Look, Director Kim.

279
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm not saying I won't do it.

280
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,468
But you keep brushing off my opinion.

281
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:09,169
Do you take me for a mindless drone?

282
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,930
I'm a person with a mind and emotions!

283
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,252
Forget it.

284
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:25,307
This is so annoying.

285
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,784
The grape festival...

286
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,758
would've been a total disaster
without Mr. Wook.

287
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:43,616
I sent grapes abroad for the first time.

288
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,248
That made me so proud.

289
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:46,991
Since he's a world star,

290
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,927
I thought he was nothing like
us common people.

291
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,653
But thanks to him,

292
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,813
I could pay my granddaughter's tuition.

293
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,931
I was too busy to watch dramas,

294
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:08,563
but after shipping grapes to China,
I bawled my eyes out.

295
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,475
That made me so happy.

296
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,333
I shed tears of joy.

297
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:26,882
Really? Mr. Wook said "Yes?"

298
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,889
Okay. Thank you.

299
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,238
That's great! Boss.

300
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,348
Mr. Wook decided on our drama.

301
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,675
He's going to appear in our drama.

302
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,754
Really?

303
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,476
How did he decide so fast?

304
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,524
You see, Chief Ko from Woori City...

305
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:44,443
had it out with him in person.

306
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:46,011
What? Really?

307
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:49,130
Saying he trusts your skills and insight,

308
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,300
he called the City Hall...

309
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,765
and assured them it would surely succeed.

310
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:55,200
Really? That's great.

311
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,452
Boss.

312
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:03,397
Shouldn't you at least
thank Chief Ko for it?

313
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,962
Goodness, is this a study cafe?

314
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,019
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

315
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,099
People study here these days.

316
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,238
I see.

317
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,219
I'm glad you're here.

318
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,305
First, let's check Ye Ji's learning style.

319
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,189
She scored the highest in visual learning.

320
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,265
Studying in a visually soothing space...

321
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,191
might be the most effective.

322
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,722
Then we'd like such a spot for her.

323
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,724
Okay.

324
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:38,937
Hello.

325
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,569
You're Hyun Seok, right?

326
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:41,986
Yes.

327
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:43,937
Ye Ji, did you enroll here?

328
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,674
I'm not here because of you.

329
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:48,926
- Dad, let's go.
- Okay.

330
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,700
Hyun Seok, just try to get along.

331
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,324
I don't know what caused the rift,

332
00:20:56,324 --> 00:20:58,426
but kids your age are all buddies.

333
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,421
Ye Ji is more than just a friend.

334
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,373
Okay, then.

335
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,890
Are you good with Hyun Seok?

336
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,383
No.

337
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:11,830
Then what?

338
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,771
I can't get my heart
to soften up toward him.

339
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,453
But all I need is one real apology.

340
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,003
You said you wouldn't see anyone.

341
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,035
Did you intentionally go there
to run into Hyun Seok?

342
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,848
No, I'm just going to study.

343
00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:30,998
What? What's this?

344
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,047
What?

345
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:35,008
- Wait a minute.
- You look good together.

346
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,767
Did you have a date with her?

347
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,087
No. Goodness.

348
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:42,529
Dad, are you dating her?

349
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:43,790
I said no.

350
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,096
Why did she move out suddenly?

351
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,670
You see...

352
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,690
Did you fight?

353
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,351
So you did.

354
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,599
Then you're dating her.

355
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,513
You're so sneaky.

356
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,120
What? Sneaky?

357
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
What's the big deal?

358
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,488
It didn't work out with Uncle Jun Woo.

359
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,431
Patch it up. Why make her move?

360
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,045
You're a man without manners.

361
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,446
What did you say?

362
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,995
Adult relationships seem harder.

363
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,847
She even had to move out.

364
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:24,503
- Let's eat.
- It looks delicious.

365
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,398
Sang Sik isn't eating again.

366
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,236
I know why he's not eating right.

367
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:30,451
What do you know?

368
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,948
It's because of our neighbor lady.

369
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,888
What are you talking about?

370
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,646
Uncle Jun Woo, are you okay?

371
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:42,075
Are you guys bothered that
I know all this stuff?

372
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:45,341
Why would I be bothered?
You're just smart.

373
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:47,163
I don't really care.

374
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:49,251
They're adults who can sort it out.

375
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,742
What's that about adults?

376
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:54,465
Not having breakfast again?

377
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:56,106
No, I'm not feeling well.

378
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,582
You go ahead.

379
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,431
Just tell her sorry.

380
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,867
If you're into her, just apologize...

381
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,510
and bring her back here, holding hands.

382
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:10,089
What are you talking about?

383
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:11,815
It's nothing.

384
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:15,082
You, Hyun Seok, and all men are the same.

385
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,218
Turning into adults,

386
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:42,801
we say "Not yet" and "That won't do"

387
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,177
as we become more cautious.

388
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:48,409
But as we live in adulthood,
perhaps the words "not yet..."

389
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:53,532
is nothing but fear and cowardice.

390
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:01,034
Turning into adults,

391
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,315
we say "I should or shouldn't have,"

392
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:07,671
and repeatedly regret the choices we make.

393
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:11,539
But even if they feel wrong,

394
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:15,013
let's remember that was our best.

395
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:25,729
Hello?

396
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,947
Yes, I'm nearby there.

397
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,478
What brings you two here?

398
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,896
It's just for something.

399
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,845
I'll leave you to talk.

400
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:39,855
Thanks.

401
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:46,565
I don't know what happened
with my brother,

402
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,927
but how can you leave like this?

403
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,781
There's still time left on the lease,

404
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,477
so if you're overwhelmed,

405
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,133
just spend a few days outside
and then come back.

406
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:02,101
It's not that simple.
Let's just end the lease.

407
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:06,547
Well, there is this situation.

408
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,187
Why? What's the matter?

409
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:10,827
It's because of Hun.

410
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:12,532
Preparing for his study abroad,

411
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:16,236
I already submitted the lease papers
as evidence of sponsorship.

412
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:17,323
Really?

413
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:20,378
How did my brother upset you?

414
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:21,932
What did he do wrong?

415
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:25,262
Me and my family will do better, okay?

416
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:33,291
Some say food is a feast for the eyes.

417
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,634
That's why plating is important.

418
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,787
The Nordic colors and simplicity...

419
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,909
elevate the taste of the food.

420
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,089
What?

421
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,436
I need to take a picture.

422
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,058
Did you upload everything?

423
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,449
Yes, take a look. Do you like it?

424
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:02,937
Goodness, you're a great photographer.

425
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,780
This comes with good sense.

426
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,495
You're superb.

427
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,949
What, why is this only shots of my face?

428
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,296
What?

429
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,463
I was just taking random shots.

430
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,263
Did you unintentionally fall...
for my handsome face?

431
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:42,220
Sang Sik should learn social media.

432
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,248
He wouldn't be interested.

433
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:47,784
The city blog is even a hassle for him.

434
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:50,503
But he should keep learning.

435
00:26:50,503 --> 00:26:54,613
That way, he can keep contact
even from a distance.

436
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,616
With whom?

437
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,071
That's a good idea.

438
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,369
Should I handle her?

439
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:04,833
Okay?

440
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,837
Okay.

441
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:14,793
- Boss.
- Yes?

442
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:16,991
Do you post on social media?

443
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:20,343
No, I used to post, but not anymore.

444
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:21,343
Why not?

445
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,048
It's just a hassle.

446
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:26,602
Sharing what belongs in a diary...

447
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,901
with the public is a bit too much.

448
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:31,361
Now it's flooded with ads, anyway.

449
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:34,755
As a star director, she used to get
comments like a celebrity.

450
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,696
That's what I'm saying.

451
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,833
Posting updates to promote
about our drama...

452
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,320
would be a good thing.

453
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,441
My account doesn't get many views.

454
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:47,335
Should I reactivate yours?

455
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,540
That's a good idea.

456
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,523
To promote the drama?

457
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,459
Perhaps we should.

458
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,305
Social media?

459
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,951
Yes.

460
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,504
You've become a star since
the Woori City song,

461
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,449
so it's a chance to promote the city.

462
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:05,641
I couldn't manage after making
something like that.

463
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,683
Just post about tourist spots,

464
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:10,282
safety guidelines for facilities,

465
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:13,625
wildfire, heatwave, earthquake warnings,

466
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,227
and all that kind of stuff.

467
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,635
That sounds pretty good.

468
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,980
Once you have an account,

469
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,386
you'll get used to managing it well.

470
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,314
I'll activate one for you.

471
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:24,719
Sure, let's do that.

472
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,231
Name, Ko Sang Sik.

473
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:31,067
So she can't return your money?

474
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:33,540
Not for quite some time.

475
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,955
Why don't you just talk to him?

476
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:39,539
I already tried before leaving.

477
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,053
You decided to keep away...

478
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,101
for the sake of the other person.

479
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,285
But I don't buy that.

480
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:49,062
You claim you left for him,

481
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:53,270
but perhaps you left because
he didn't ask you to stay.

482
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,750
Give it some thought.

483
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,855
Hang on.

484
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:04,041
Hello. I'm with a friend now.

485
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:07,228
Goodness, was that today?

486
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:10,812
I can't believe that I forgot.

487
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:12,584
Okay, I got it.

488
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:14,854
What's it about?

489
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,925
It was the student I mentioned.

490
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:20,653
I promised to accompany him
to the city education fair.

491
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:22,247
Today is the last day.

492
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,228
I'm okay, so you should go.

493
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,607
Then I'll see you at home.

494
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,621
You should head home first.

495
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:30,823
All right.

496
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:32,663
- Sorry.
- No problem.

497
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:49,341
How did you like it?

498
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:52,551
It was very helpful. Thanks.

499
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:55,413
Where are you going? One more drink.

500
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:56,927
For crying out loud.

501
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,965
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

502
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,535
What's with this guy?

503
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,565
Just move along.

504
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:06,205
You're looking good.

505
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,508
How much older are you?

506
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:11,190
She looks at least ten years older.

507
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,127
He might be her son.

508
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,779
- What did you say?
- Let's just go.

509
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,723
You can't leave yet.

510
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,072
There is trash on the ground.

511
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,517
Just move along if you're drunk, okay?

512
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:27,118
Lady, don't bother with kids
when you have men like us.

513
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,550
Please don't...

514
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,305
What are you doing?

515
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:32,599
What's this kid's problem?

516
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,038
Look, let's just go.

517
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,566
Let go. I'm going because of you.

518
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,223
I can't with those geezers.

519
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:45,926
I'm embarrassed they're my age.

520
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,401
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

521
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:54,543
You're not hurt?

522
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:55,977
I'm okay.

523
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:04,575
My word.

524
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:08,402
(People who you might know)

525
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,713
(Ko Sang Sik)

526
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,455
Goodness, this is unexpected.

527
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:20,303
These are recent updates.

528
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:28,639
Shouldn't you thank Chief Ko for it?

529
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:40,001
I wanted to drop a thank you
about Mr. Wook.

530
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,580
As the SBC's producer,
let me express my gratitude.

531
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:45,973
This Wednesday after work,

532
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,864
I'll wait in front of Cheonglim Station.

533
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:52,316
Sorry.

534
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:55,219
You should have stayed out longer.

535
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:58,350
Why would I be out all night?

536
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,095
You could if you like him.

537
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:02,372
He's my student.

538
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,798
Right. You hate younger guys.

539
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,626
But he was quite manly today.

540
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
What?

541
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,413
Drunk guys were coming at me.

542
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:18,557
Just move along, okay?

543
00:32:18,557 --> 00:32:20,323
What are you doing?

544
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:23,016
That must have been nice.

545
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:25,471
Dating must be as fun as this.

546
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,285
Has he contacted you?

547
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:33,065
Why would he?

548
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,556
But are you waiting for him?

549
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,689
Since he helped with work,

550
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,810
I messaged him online to meet me.

551
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,509
But who knows?

552
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,126
Heartbreak is also a part of love.

553
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:47,897
It's not over yet.

554
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:59,181
Are you here with your friends
for a live broadcast?

555
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,181
Yes.

556
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,734
I recently looked up your dramas...

557
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:04,960
- and watched them.
- Really?

558
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,408
Every single one of your works...

559
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:09,401
strangely touched my heart.

560
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,785
And they weren't just light entertainment,

561
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:14,345
so there was a lingering feeling.

562
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:17,857
That made me like you even more.

563
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:20,504
But you were cool before that
and quite modern.

564
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,179
So what did you want to tell me?

565
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,682
Just get to know my dad.

566
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,771
What?

567
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:33,014
I've seen you two bickering a lot,

568
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,588
but friendship would work for now.

569
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:36,602
For now?

570
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:38,466
Best friends don't break up.

571
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:41,094
But it happens to people in love
and married couples.

572
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:43,562
You know everything.

573
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:46,662
Of course. I've been there with Hyun Seok.

574
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:51,003
Aren't you hungry? Let's grab some food.

575
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:53,834
No, I know you're busy.

576
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,267
I should get back anyway since
my friends are waiting.

577
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,172
Really?

578
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:59,691
Then I won't stop you.

579
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,014
Could you do something for my class...

580
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:06,845
- What?
- Never mind.

581
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:07,885
I'll get going.

582
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:08,945
Okay.

583
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,095
(Min Ji Seon)

584
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,366
What's the happy news you
want to tell me first?

585
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:28,851
I got picked as a sub-model
for Woori City.

586
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:32,572
Really? Do you mean with Mr. Wook?

587
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,583
Yes.

588
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:37,398
That's great news. Congratulations.

589
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,163
It's all thanks to you.

590
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,379
No, it was an open audition.

591
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:45,888
I'm a model with good skills,
unlike my acting.

592
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:48,617
Your wish came true.

593
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:50,343
You said this is your second home.

594
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,039
Do you have a date here?

595
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:54,860
Jun.

596
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,093
Is there good news?

597
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:59,293
Ji Seon was picked as our city model.

598
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:00,918
I'm only a sub-model.

599
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:02,293
That's just as great.

600
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:05,872
Really? That's great. Congratulations.

601
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:11,271
There is something I want to ask you.

602
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:12,344
Me, too.

603
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:17,494
Among the characters in our drama,

604
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:20,464
there is an excellent chef like you.

605
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:22,999
I thought you could help with
preparing the food.

606
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,742
Mi Rye told me about it.

607
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:28,430
So you're in need of a food stylist,
right?

608
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,433
Exactly.

609
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,370
That sounds good.

610
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,729
Thanks a lot.

611
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,314
No worries.

612
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,980
I should be there for you as a neighbor.

613
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:42,310
Your neighbor?

614
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,488
That's what I want to ask you.

615
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:45,802
Get some rest.

616
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,296
Rest?

617
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:49,842
You should return to rest at home.

618
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,058
I truly have the best neighbors.

619
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,778
All your family members asked me
to come back.

620
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,689
Well, except for one person.

621
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,390
I see.

622
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,466
All right.

623
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,122
One more time.

624
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,112
Great.

625
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:37,934
(Ko Sang Sik)

626
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,600
(I wanted to drop a thank you note
to Mr. Wook.)

627
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
(Unread)

628
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:48,088
The PR ambassadors are here.

629
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,711
Chief Ko, the drama posters are out!

630
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,953
Got it.

631
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,689
Can you email me pictures of that?

632
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:56,720
Sure.

633
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,777
Actually, never mind.

634
00:36:58,777 --> 00:36:59,851
Let's see here.

635
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,132
Ms. Han, out of the way.

636
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:14,184
Chief Ko, do you post on social media?

637
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:16,317
- Yes.
- Really? Let me see.

638
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,291
- No.
- We can follow each other.

639
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,395
I'll find your username.

640
00:37:23,795 --> 00:37:25,708
(Read)

641
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,859
He read the message.

642
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:36,758
Hello, Ye Ji.

643
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,393
I'm sorry to bother you,

644
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:41,895
but I have a quick favor to ask.

645
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:43,114
What is it?

646
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:46,984
We had many parents come to class...

647
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:49,639
and explain their various professions.

648
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,607
Today, Ye Ji has invited a special guest.

649
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:54,828
So let's look forward to it.

650
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,572
Please come in.

651
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,713
Hello.

652
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,643
- Hello.
- Hello.

653
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:08,794
I'm SBC's Producer Gang Min Ju,

654
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:12,556
and I make dramas at the network.

655
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:17,726
- You're pretty.
- That's amazing.

656
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,024
All the repairs have been finished,

657
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:31,329
including the damaged and botched spots.

658
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:32,752
All right, good work.

659
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:36,653
I've discovered during the repairs...

660
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:39,718
that repair materials were swapped
and rebates were taken,

661
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,973
which yielded quite a profit
for Director Shin.

662
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:45,334
Are you going to let that go?

663
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,334
No.

664
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:51,144
But first, we must save the ferry
to cut back on costs.

665
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:52,815
Do you have any plans?

666
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,368
You wanted to hold the drama's
press conference here.

667
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,750
Yes, it was a suggestion
made by our team.

668
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,960
That's not a bad idea.

669
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,904
Afterwards, it can be a marine museum...

670
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:03,911
or perhaps a bird museum.

671
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,320
Then should we hold
the press conference here?

672
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,363
Let's do that.

673
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,575
(Moms with daughters to meet on
October 5th at 4 p.m.)

674
00:39:18,645 --> 00:39:21,925
I didn't expect such a huge response.

675
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,861
Thanks for coming on short notice.

676
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:27,404
No, I enjoyed it more.

677
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,149
Today was such a great time.

678
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,027
It gave me a chance to reflect on my work.

679
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:33,603
I'll tell Dad about this when I get home.

680
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,197
That you came today.

681
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:37,100
No, just leave it.

682
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,675
This was a favor I did for you.

683
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:43,580
Then you two should make up
and get along now.

684
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:47,554
Okay, get back to class.

685
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,362
All right. Take care.

686
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:50,402
Bye.

687
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:01,881
Your new car runs like a dream.

688
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:03,771
Of course, you helped pick it out.

689
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,401
This is really nice.

690
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,217
It's been a while...

691
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:14,073
since I went on a drive with a woman.

692
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:17,443
That's why you shouldn't
get too lost in work.

693
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,881
Come out and enjoy things.

694
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:22,632
You should feel the seasons change.

695
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:24,089
Tell me about it.

696
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,019
I'm stuck in my office all the time.

697
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:28,092
Why is that?

698
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,486
Don't you travel a lot for global trade?

699
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,399
What?

700
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:37,217
Well, my employees handle that.

701
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:40,373
All I do is exercise and sign papers off.

702
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,804
For school.

703
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,698
There is Ye Ji's dad.

704
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,647
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

705
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:53,775
You can sit here.

706
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:56,614
- Is Hae Dam doing well?
- Of course.

707
00:40:56,614 --> 00:41:00,387
You're such a sweet dad to come like this.

708
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:01,588
I know.

709
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:05,049
I wish my husband were more like you.

710
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,912
You're too kind.

711
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:10,247
Ye Ji might have been happier
if her mom were around.

712
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:13,046
What makes you say that?

713
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:15,455
Though her grades are impressive,

714
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:19,022
she has been hanging out
with problematic friends lately.

715
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:20,936
Problematic friends?

716
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:25,591
After spending more time with them
instead of Hae Dam,

717
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,932
she ditched her English contest
and goes to idol concerts.

718
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:30,853
I see.

719
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:33,447
It's okay, kids her age are like that.

720
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,745
Even Hyun Seok tired of Ye Ji...

721
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,785
and asked her to break up.

722
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,613
Well, about that.

723
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:45,089
The thing about Hyun Seok is,

724
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:47,722
Hae Dam keeps showing interest in him.

725
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,183
My little Hae Dam?

726
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:53,839
That doesn't seem right.

727
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,830
Maybe you should have a talk with her.

728
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,734
I guess I should.

729
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,105
Ye Ji is so fortunate.

730
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:03,129
She has a dad who communicates with her.

731
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm so envious.

732
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,796
(Cheonglim Station)

733
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,245
On this upcoming Wednesday after work,

734
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:19,208
I'll be waiting in front
of Cheonglim Station.

735
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:38,109
It's raining.

736
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,499
The forecast was right about it.

737
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:43,922
- Thanks, I forgot to bring an umbrella.
- No problem.

738
00:42:43,922 --> 00:42:47,072
I'm told Ye Ji brought someone special...

739
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:49,409
to career lecture day at school.

740
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,065
She did? Who?

741
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,240
It was a producer lady for a network.

742
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,850
The kids were fascinated,
and she was a hit.

743
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,532
Is that right?

744
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:08,289
Thanks for waiting with an umbrella.

745
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,925
Wasn't it great spicy seafood noodle soup?

746
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:13,309
Yes, on rainy days...

747
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:14,623
- Spicy seafood noodle soup is the best.
- Spicy seafood noodle soup is the best.

748
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:17,596
Hurry along.

749
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:18,623
Ms. Koo.

750
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,305
Do you know you were my first love?

751
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:26,896
What?

752
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:29,765
I'm just saying. You should go.

753
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:31,055
And take this umbrella.

754
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:32,886
Hurry.

755
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,694
- Okay. Bye.
- See you.

756
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,366
Min Ju!

757
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:58,641
Thank you.

758
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,541
I forgot to leave you my key.

759
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,122
Why didn't you buy an umbrella?

760
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,707
I wasn't in the mood.

761
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,357
Why? Did something happen?

762
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,446
He didn't show up like I expected.

763
00:45:13,446 --> 00:45:16,325
I saw him share an umbrella
with another woman.

764
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:17,670
Seriously? Chief Ko?

765
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,160
Yes.

766
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,915
You might have seen it wrong.

767
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,650
No, I saw it clear as day.

768
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,319
Maybe she's an acquaintance.

769
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:31,614
He was laughing and acting
too sweet for that.

770
00:45:31,614 --> 00:45:34,031
They even clicked so well.

771
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,108
Is that jealousy I hear?

772
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:39,324
Don't be absurd.

773
00:45:39,324 --> 00:45:41,092
Then what is it?

774
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:44,855
I just never thought...

775
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,817
he would be so cool about it
like nothing happened.

776
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,754
Then should he be moping
like at a funeral?

777
00:45:50,754 --> 00:45:52,833
That's not what I mean.

778
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,273
But still, that was wrong of him.

779
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:56,184
Why don't you just call him?

780
00:45:56,184 --> 00:45:57,434
Why should I?

781
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:59,137
You're obviously waiting for his call.

782
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:01,264
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

783
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:02,597
I said I'm not!

784
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,916
Ye Ji.

785
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:10,049
Yes?

786
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:15,024
For your career lecture day,

787
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:16,376
did you invite someone?

788
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:17,919
How did you know?

789
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:20,719
You see, I wasn't prepared for that day,

790
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,968
so I asked our neighbor for a quick favor.

791
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:24,562
And she came right away.

792
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,332
Really?

793
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:29,703
- But I wasn't supposed to tell.
- What?

794
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,495
Since it's just something between us,

795
00:46:32,495 --> 00:46:34,089
she said you don't need to know.

796
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,377
Is that what she said?

797
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,566
You should call and thank her.

798
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:40,169
All right.

799
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:05,947
(Gang Min Ju)

800
00:47:10,813 --> 00:47:12,733
(Gang Min Ju)

801
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:27,325
(Ko Sang Sik)

802
00:47:37,195 --> 00:47:39,870
Your call cannot be connected...

803
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,003
I married him without question
since he was a lawyer,

804
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,238
thinking it would be a secure life.

805
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:58,300
But who knew he'd cheat on me so quickly?

806
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:02,282
Hearing your life story tells me...

807
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:04,050
you've had it really tough.

808
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,058
At our age,

809
00:48:06,058 --> 00:48:09,028
everyone has faced some hardship.

810
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:13,236
I wanted to become a teacher
respected by students.

811
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:16,247
But now, I want to live as I please.

812
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:18,519
A teacher?

813
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:20,745
What?

814
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:24,152
I mean, that was my dream before.

815
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,333
I see.

816
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,566
- Here.
- No, this is enough.

817
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:31,752
What? Let's talk some more.

818
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:34,409
I'm tired. Let's sleep now.

819
00:48:36,943 --> 00:48:39,910
Sleep?

820
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,657
Aren't you going to?
I must take a shower.

821
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:47,377
Right, then you should wash up first.

822
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,360
All right.

823
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,783
Are you going somewhere?

824
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:59,077
I was just putting it down here.

825
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:01,052
I see.

826
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:02,877
You should get washed.

827
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:04,974
I should.

828
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,718
How could he not come home
and have his phone turned off?

829
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,645
Mom, didn't Dad come home?

830
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:29,063
Don't worry about it. Hurry to school.

831
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:34,659
I know where he works out.

832
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:35,980
Do you want to know?

833
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,674
You know where?

834
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:39,157
It's Aegyeong Sports Center.

835
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:41,202
That's not it.

836
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:43,516
Really? But I found a towel.

837
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,841
- A towel?
- It was with his sweatsuit.

838
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:49,799
So I put it in the hamper.

839
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:53,460
I'm off to school.

840
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,631
Okay, have a good one.

841
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,502
(Aegyeong Sports Center)

842
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:11,173
My goodness.

843
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:13,497
Aren't you friends with my neighbor?

844
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:14,705
Yes, that's right.

845
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,186
Have you seen my husband here?

846
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:19,296
Who is your husband?

847
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:20,982
Park Cheon Su.

848
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,868
There isn't anyone like that.

849
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,573
What? There isn't anyone like him?

850
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:32,083
Can I ask for your name?

851
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,930
Who are you to ask that?

852
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,911
Come on, Ae Gyeong. Get in the car.

853
00:51:38,797 --> 00:51:41,551
I'm sure he said Ae Gyeong.

854
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,950
Ae Gyeong.

855
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,142
What? Ae Gyeong?

856
00:51:48,444 --> 00:51:50,272
So "Angel without Wings" is...

857
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,054
our neighbor's friend?

858
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:13,359
Are you sleeping, Richard?

859
00:52:14,404 --> 00:52:16,360
No, not yet.

860
00:52:19,276 --> 00:52:21,202
Sleep if you're tired.

861
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:23,362
No.

862
00:52:23,362 --> 00:52:25,333
We should do it.

863
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,677
Do what?

864
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:31,562
What?

865
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:35,092
Never mind.

866
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:11,773
Wait a minute.

867
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:17,862
(Homebody)

868
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:21,014
The ringtone is "Angel without Wings."

869
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:29,107
Ae Gyeong.

870
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,327
Just go.

871
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:34,358
What?

872
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:37,864
I'm tired, so I should sleep.

873
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:40,697
I see.

874
00:53:41,462 --> 00:53:43,008
Okay, then.

875
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:48,221
Have a good night.

876
00:54:00,466 --> 00:54:03,115
What an idiot.

877
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:06,278
How could I be such a fool?

878
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:09,920
Hurry up, you'll be late.

879
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:13,208
What a naive man.

880
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,725
He seems innocent and nice.

881
00:54:15,725 --> 00:54:17,285
No way.

882
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:19,789
I'm not looking for a first love here.

883
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,732
I was someone's first love.

884
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:23,117
Who?

885
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:26,628
My student from the blind date.

886
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:29,158
He said you're his first love?

887
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:32,708
Kids often crush on their teachers.

888
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:35,345
I guess you're both dating now.

889
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:37,274
- Dating?
- No.

890
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:41,002
I doubt it. Your faces look thrilled.

891
00:54:41,002 --> 00:54:42,174
- You mean us?
- You mean us?

892
00:54:42,174 --> 00:54:43,724
Jinx, you read my mind.

893
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:51,884
So what are you going to do?

894
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,586
Do what? It's over after moving out.

895
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,376
To be honest, he's not exactly a catch.

896
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:04,768
The guy is widowed with a daughter,

897
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,617
and he has a bustling family.

898
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:10,054
Right. You're neither friends nor lovers.

899
00:55:10,054 --> 00:55:12,215
You work together but separately,

900
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:15,176
so you're not his office wife
or business partner.

901
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:17,747
He's nothing but my contact for
the drama, so what?

902
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,225
Goodness.

903
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:43,650
I'm home.

904
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:48,226
Didn't you hear me?

905
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:51,922
You're such a lazy sloth.

906
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:54,776
What? Lazy sloth?

907
00:55:54,776 --> 00:55:56,872
Look, Park Cheon Su!

908
00:55:56,872 --> 00:55:58,723
Where were you last night?

909
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,399
Where did you sleep?

910
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,048
I slept at the sauna, so what?

911
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:03,252
The sauna?

912
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,841
Which sauna are you talking about?

913
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:10,385
Good grief.

914
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:12,017
So now you start talking.

915
00:56:12,017 --> 00:56:14,201
Do I have to not come home
to get you to talk?

916
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:16,233
How about we don't speak at all?

917
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:17,725
That's best for us.

918
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:22,526
Where are you going? Where's my food?

919
00:56:24,836 --> 00:56:26,200
Goodness.

920
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:52,263
My word.

921
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,670
What are you doing here?

922
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,005
I'm here to exercise.

923
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:02,791
Really?

924
00:57:03,427 --> 00:57:05,627
- Yes.
- Why all of a sudden?

925
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:08,601
Not so much for anti-aging,

926
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:10,462
but to build more strength.

927
00:57:10,462 --> 00:57:12,239
- Strength?
- Yes.

928
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,400
To fight and pull at someone's hair,

929
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,527
I need courage, strength, and guts.

930
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:20,359
Is that right?

931
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:22,577
You got the right idea. This way.

932
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:37,216
(Gang Min Ju)

933
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:43,255
This Wednesday after work,

934
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,266
I'll wait in front of Cheonglim Station.

935
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:48,927
Wednesday? It's Thursday.

936
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,642
I should go see her.

937
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:12,567
Nobody leaves until the 3rd round, okay?

938
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,182
- Let's go.
- Okay, you got it.

939
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,765
All right.

940
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,934
What are you doing? Leave it alone.

941
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:20,460
Just do your own work.

942
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,720
Why? We always did this together.

943
00:59:24,044 --> 00:59:25,380
I told you to leave it.

944
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,530
Get in here.

945
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:35,120
You were too busy dating,
so why bother now?

946
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
What?

947
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,828
I even cleaned the windows by myself...

948
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:39,381
when I couldn't even reach them.

949
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:41,028
Did you really?

950
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:42,711
You little brat.

951
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:46,333
That's why I told you to wait.

952
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:50,195
Look.

953
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:59,595
Look, Ko Mi Rye. You...

954
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,364
What?

955
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,427
You're too tall, like a giant.

956
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:08,906
Why are you still so short?

957
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,961
You even eat more than me.

958
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:13,279
Just step on it.

959
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,864
- Good heavens.
- For crying out loud.

960
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,175
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

961
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,693
Are these all the filming locations?

962
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:33,252
Why? Don't you like them?

963
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:36,157
Well, they're okay.

964
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:39,244
But we could use someplace special.

965
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:42,703
Then how about this place?

966
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,644
(Woori City's Suspension Bridge)

967
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:48,521
Well, I'm not sure.

968
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,557
I'll have to see it myself.

969
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:55,844
Are you going alone there?

970
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,964
Everyone else is busy with the conference.

971
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,133
Work hard.

972
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,315
Stay safe, Boss.

973
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:05,338
These are what you asked for.

974
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:07,092
- Here.
- Thank you.

975
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,398
I got you one each.

976
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,087
This is the Regional Tourism Team.

977
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:19,158
What? Lost her footing?

978
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:21,863
Is she badly hurt?

979
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:26,010
Okay, that's a relief.

980
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,893
Tell me her name and contact details.

981
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:32,681
Yes, all right.

982
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:34,497
What happened?

983
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:37,776
A tourist slipped and fell
on Gamak Mountain.

984
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:40,596
The emergency team is on its way.

985
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,947
They asked if there was an issue
with the facility.

986
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:46,283
Chief Ko.

987
01:01:48,064 --> 01:01:49,657
Sir, what's happened?

988
01:01:49,657 --> 01:01:51,208
You need to fence off this place.

989
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,446
She was in there picking acorns.

990
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:55,950
That's not good. Is anyone else hurt?

991
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,356
No, they're all okay.

992
01:01:57,356 --> 01:02:00,093
You can't go in there.

993
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:02,311
Collecting acorns like this is illegal.

994
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:03,573
Illegal?

995
01:02:03,573 --> 01:02:05,854
Why is this such a big deal?

996
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:07,677
It might not seem like much,

997
01:02:07,677 --> 01:02:10,933
but these acorns feed animals like
squirrels, deer, and raccoons.

998
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,767
If you sweep them from the mountain,

999
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,837
the critters starve in the winter.

1000
01:02:14,837 --> 01:02:16,762
Taking acorns like this could even...

1001
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:18,983
get you fined. Did you know that?

1002
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,020
- Yes, I did.
- Please don't do it again.

1003
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,020
Okay.

1004
01:03:09,132 --> 01:03:11,335
Those who are destined will meet.

1005
01:03:12,877 --> 01:03:15,349
Even if you try to run.

1006
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:17,482
Even if you circle Earth ten times.

1007
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:24,247
Those who are destined will meet.

1008
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:28,814
Even if you try to run.

1009
01:03:28,814 --> 01:03:30,754
Even if you circle Earth ten times.

(Second to Last Love)

1011
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:53,337
A press conference on the ferry?

1012
01:03:53,337 --> 01:03:55,522
Problems are sure to arise.

1013
01:03:55,522 --> 01:03:57,770

1014
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,313
Richard Park? I got you now.

1015

You should come with me.

Are you heading home?

1017
01:04:04,623 --> 01:04:05,623
Where is Chief Ko?

01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:11,301
Come back.

1021
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:13,070
