1
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,339
- You're home.
- Yes, I am.

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,086
Ko Sang Sik.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,396
Why were you nice to me that day?

4
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:25,155
You showed me the fireflies
and rode a cable car with me.

5
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:30,373
Well, it was because of the inspection.

6
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:36,422
The movie quote you said in the cable car.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,893
Yes?

8
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,378
My late boyfriend...

9
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,707
used to say it all the time.

10
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,763
Is that right?

11
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:49,826
I visited his mother today.

12
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:55,673
Is she doing well?

13
00:00:57,272 --> 00:00:58,304
No.

14
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,416
Things aren't looking good.

15
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:06,659
She has advanced pancreatic cancer.

16
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:12,147
Before she passes away,

17
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,995
I want to ease her deep sorrow.

18
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:21,282
No one came forward to explain
when she lost her son.

19
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:27,036
The fire was from spontaneous combustion,

20
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,482
so there wasn't anyone to blame.

21
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:38,090
He probably stayed back to save everyone,

22
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,802
and couldn't get out in time.

23
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,514
Gang Min Ju.

24
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,555
Why are you telling me this?

25
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,170
Chief Ko.

26
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,312
You talk about principles, safety,
and responsibility,

27
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,322
and take them seriously.

28
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:04,773
So what's your point?

29
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:08,557
Even though it's all in the past,
I want to know.

30
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,526
I need to know the truth.

31
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:30,082
The bracelet he clung to at the end...

32
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,960
Wasn't it yours?

33
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,599
The one marked with SS.

34
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,811
Being grown-up means...

35
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,711
taking responsibility for one's choices.

36
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,251
Are we truly...

37
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,488
owning up to our decisions?

38
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,297
Am I right?

39
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,536
- That bracelet...
- It's mine.

40
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:30,086
Did you say it's yours?

41
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:34,293
Yes.

42
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,024
How...

43
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,835
How...

44
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:47,290
How did he get your bracelet?

45
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,274
At the scene,

46
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,752
I was there with him.

47
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,256
You were with him?

48
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,502
When the fire broke out,

49
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,412
you were with Eun Ho?

50
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,884
Yes.

51
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,649
But why did you lie?

52
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:14,509
You said you don't know him
or the bracelet.

53
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,732
Why did you hide that?

54
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,013
You see...

55
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,761
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:34,082
No matter what I tell you,

57
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,754
you'll take it as an excuse.

58
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,613
Even if it's an excuse,

59
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,333
I want you to tell me.

60
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,468
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:45,628
Ko Sang Sik.

62
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,046
What on earth happened...

63
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,274
that would make you run away like this?

64
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,811
It was an accident.

65
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,228
Wasn't it?

66
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,401
Tell me. What happened?

67
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:23,186
What on earth happened?

68
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,241
Why did Eun Ho...

69
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:35,717
Why did he have to die?

70
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:41,177
Tell me. Tell me why!

71
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,423
I can no longer...

72
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,005
run away from this now.

73
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:01,350
What was his name?

74
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:03,423
Jang Eun Ho.

75
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,389
He knew about Eun Ho.

76
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:15,734
But why didn't he tell me?

77
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,459
But you haven't done much.

78
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,212
You haven't ridden cable cars...

79
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,518
or even been to theme parks.

80
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,251
Don't look at the watch.

81
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:29,383
Always live in the present.

82
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,367
I had been blind.

83
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,678
Oblivious to it all,

84
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,549
I was naively happy.

85
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,060
(Second to Last Love)

86
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,186
(Episode 12)

87
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,139
Aren't you going to tell me?

88
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:18,964
Okay.

89
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:24,407
Ko Sang Sik was my assistant...

90
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,937
when I was at KBN.

91
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,146
What?

92
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,786
Why didn't you tell me that?

93
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:42,136
Well, you see...

94
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:45,397
Why would I bring up old wounds?

95
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,197
It would only upset you.

96
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,920
Was he the assistant who quit,
after getting shocked by it all?

97
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:51,794
Yes.

98
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,976
But why do you suddenly ask?

99
00:08:56,198 --> 00:09:00,485
What on Earth happened that day?

100
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:01,964
You said it was an accident.

101
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,644
What are you talking about?

102
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:09,531
Did Ko Sang Sik tell you something?

103
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,965
No.

104
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,534
He won't talk.

105
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,263
That's why I'm asking you about it.

106
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,533
You barely moved on from it,

107
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,084
so stop revisiting the past.

108
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:23,464
You're only hurting yourself.

109
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,084
It was at a garment factory,

110
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,244
and the cops said it caught fire.

111
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,003
That's what I thought.

112
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:35,307
But the way he reacted...

113
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:38,781
He wouldn't talk.

114
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,894
That felt like something was off.

115
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:58,404
You should have informed
the grieving family.

116
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,580
It's behind us now.

117
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,624
You're also doing well with other work.

118
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,062
He didn't say what happened?

119
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,267
Sang Sik must have feelings for her.

120
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,590
It was an accident.

121
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,519
What on Earth happened?

122
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,389
With you taking up all the space,

123
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,364
tourists can't even take pictures.

124
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,370
What if something goes wrong here?

125
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,457
I'm the chief producer of this crew.

126
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:40,904
Then let's see you take charge.

127
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,400
You're not cleared to film, so leave.

128
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,808
Are you patting yourself on the back
for nearly killing someone?

129
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,662
This wouldn't have happened
if you had followed the rules.

130
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,541
To film in the bungee jump area,

131
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,837
you were required to submit
a proper request.

132
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:56,251
If you had taken this basic step,

133
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,605
you wouldn't have taken a plunge
or put your life at risk.

134
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,850
With viewer ratings and ads,

135
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,149
it's the epitome of capitalism.

136
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,819
My family doesn't care or enjoy...

137
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,676
broadcasting networks and dramas.

138
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:37,867
Aren't the writers here today?

139
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,307
No, they're busy writing the script...

140
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,458
since it's almost the deadline.

141
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,961
Here you go.

142
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:49,235
- Thank you.
- Is there anything else?

143
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,007
Would you like a drink?

144
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,489
No, thank you.

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,287
Chief Ko, here.

146
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:58,355
Thanks.

147
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:04,235
Can you scoot in for me?

148
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:09,954
I want the aisle seat.

149
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,052
Let's go.

150
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,792
Goodness, I really like this spot.

151
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,063
It would look great for scenes.

152
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,584
It would be hard to film on the boat...

153
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:38,472
because it's not running now.

154
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,692
Boss, have you been here before?

155
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,792
Yes, after our meeting in the area.

156
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,199
Yes, we met you here.

157
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:51,726
Then can we use it docked?

158
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:55,094
Well, we had some initial issues,

159
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:58,337
but now it's safe after making repairs.

160
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:01,593
We are developing ideas for the community.

161
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,377
You're welcome to check it out.

162
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,840
Then can we take a look?

163
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,418
It's perfect for a romance scene.

164
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,865
The repairs are complete,

165
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,871
- but it hasn't run for long.
- I see.

166
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:21,903
But it looks nice after fixing it up.

167
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:25,447
Tourists take pictures over here.

168
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,898
And if you look there...

169
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:36,233
Chief Ko, you should try some.

170
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,353
That's okay. You eat it.

171
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:42,088
I prepared it in the morning for you.

172
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,143
So how can I eat it alone?

173
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:47,499
Open your mouth.

174
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,775
Water.

175
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,400
Do you need water?

176
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,331
I'll bring it over now.

177
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:12,880
Mr. Cha, don't you have any water left?

178
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,799
Yes, I think so.

179
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,666
But I need to hurry.

180
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,055
Have you had breakfast?

181
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,074
Yes.

182
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,733
Can you also fish here?

183
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,807
Yes, that's possible.

184
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:42,038
We're thinking about turning this ferry...

185
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:45,024
into a marine museum for the kids.

186
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:47,983
I suggest making videos about...

187
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,103
the local fish and birds.

188
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,436
Sure.

189
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,418
You could produce it yourself.

190
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:55,929
What?

191
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,332
You produce dramas as an assistant, right?

192
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:06,572
That explains your vast collection
of movies and music.

193
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,532
Why were you scared to tell me...

194
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,375
that you had my job before?

195
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,404
At the filming site,

196
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:23,115
did something happen that
I don't know about?

197
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,183
Why can't you say anything?

198
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,088
You didn't start the fire.

199
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:29,088
That's enough.

200
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,081
Goodness me.

201
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:49,682
What's this?

202
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,646
- What?
- What was this sound?

203
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,627
What was that sound?

204
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:05,685
I'm not sure.

205
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,971
Aren't you hurt?

206
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,036
- Gi Cheol.
- Producer Nam.

207
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,215
- How did this happen?
- Are you okay?

208
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,019
Are you okay? Look here.

209
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,044
The camera.

210
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,424
What should we do about the camera?

211
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,527
How did this happen?

212
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:25,718
What's wrong with the ceiling?

213
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,968
I asked you to shoot over there,
so why did you come in here?

214
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,447
What did you say?

215
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,440
There was no warning to stay out.

216
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,823
I clearly stated
it was under construction.

217
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,086
You claimed it was safe
with the repairs finished.

218
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:38,490
Hold on, let's not argue here.

219
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,548
What's going on?

220
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,594
Boss.

221
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:44,578
The ceiling...

222
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,101
- Are you injured anywhere?
- I'm okay.

223
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:49,468
But the camera...

224
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,013
What happened?

225
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,465
No way.

226
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:04,250
How could a little water tank
cause it to collapse?

227
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,058
It was probably an issue with the repair.

228
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,313
Your assistance is appreciated,

229
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:11,154
but we need to get reimbursement for this.

230
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,138
This latest camera costs about a grand.

231
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,970
Why should our city cover the cost?

232
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,234
It's your fault for entering
without permission.

233
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,329
But you assured us of full support...

234
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,027
and said it was safe after the repairs.

235
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:23,234
That spot was off-limits.

236
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,558
That's enough, Mr. Cha.

237
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,997
I'll have it reported at the city hall.

238
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,686
What will you tell them?

239
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:32,134
We came all this way assured
of your cooperation.

240
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,974
But after getting into this mess,

241
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:37,061
what if it becomes an issue
in the drama selection?

242
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:40,512
Well, that won't happen for you.

243
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,215
I'll report about your camera
damaged in the collapse,

244
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,368
and see if you can be compensated.

245
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,062
Good work. Enjoy the food.

246
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:57,382
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:58,402
Let's dig in.

248
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:02,766
I love marinated crabs.

249
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,036
Wait, Ms. Han.

250
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,914
Have some marinated crabs.

251
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,855
- Let's share.
- That's not necessary.

252
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,131
Thank you.

253
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,096
Chief Ko, I wanted some.

254
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,016
I love soy sauce marinated crabs.

255
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,215
Crabs?

256
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,953
Here.

257
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,168
You can have crab meat.

258
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:30,801
Crab meat?

259
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,287
(Woori City Hall)

260
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:39,170
Chief Ko, do we have to compensate for it?

261
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,170
It looks like it.

262
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,094
Then I'll be blamed as their guide...

263
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,736
when it was their mistake.

264
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,591
You didn't tell them it was off-limits...

265
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,968
or knew if they had filmed there.

266
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,695
That's why I would get blamed.

267
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,102
Then what should we do?

268
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,165
Are you going to pay for it personally?

269
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,861
Why should I do that?

270
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,445
Then look up who repaired the ferry.

271
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:00,342
- The contractors?
- Yes.

272
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:02,163
I thought they did a thorough job,

273
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:03,498
but it's all botched up.

274
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,235
If it gets revealed as shoddy repair,

275
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,426
there will be more who get blamed.

276
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,521
That seems inevitable.

277
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,375
I just hope it's not you and me...

278
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,796
who are left holding the bag.

279
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,882
Let's go.

280
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,387
At the filming site,

281
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:32,743
did something happen that
I don't know about?

282
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,723
Why can't you say anything?

283
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,588
You didn't start the fire.

284
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,605
That's enough.

285
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:50,206
What?

286
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,620
How can you be connected like that?

287
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,031
So the guilt you mentioned...

288
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,415
Yes.

289
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,390
This is exactly why...

290
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,902
destined souls meet, no matter what.

291
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,342
But if you're not fated to be together,

292
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:08,392
you can be face-to-face
and yet also worlds apart.

293
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,267
What are you going to do?

294
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,002
I want to come clean with her,

295
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:17,979
and take whatever resentment and blame.

296
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,734
I'm not afraid of that.

297
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:20,798
But?

298
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,840
That's what my head says,

299
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,719
but my heart tells me otherwise.

300
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,199
It's like a heavy boulder
is weighing me down.

301
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,110
Do you know what that is?

302
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:39,867
Your heart is already filled
with that woman.

303
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,732
You're afraid of losing her.

304
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,392
That's why you can't talk.

305
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,677
Don't blame yourself.

306
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:53,025
People pass on, and those
left behind live on.

307
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,075
But I feel like such a coward.

308
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,649
You're being honest with how you feel.

309
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,206
It's been so long since you felt
this way about someone.

310
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,674
What can I say to her?

311
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,959
How my mistake killed her fiancé?

312
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,598
But instead of facing the blame,

313
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:12,174
how I ran away from it all?

314
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:14,369
What are you talking about?

315
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:17,380
You didn't kill him,
but tried to save him.

316
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,348
It was my fault.

317
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,681
I made the fire happen.

318
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:28,072
I made him die, and that woman...

319
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,758
She faced all those hardships.

320
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,128
All right.

321
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,726
Allow yourself to feel guilty.

322
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:45,480
That's how much you like her.

323
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,224
So just for today.

324
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,727
Who is that with you?

325
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:44,211
Isn't she pretty?

326
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:45,248
Is she your aunt?

327
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:48,471
Come on.

328
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,507
Thank you.

329
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,036
Why are you alone today?

330
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:56,407
What didn't you bring that woman?

331
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:22,616
As a kid, I used to hang out here
with friends.

332
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,848
It must be filled with memories.

333
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,517
But I hated this place.

334
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:28,394
Why?

335
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:32,763
When the sun started setting
while we played,

336
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:36,565
mothers came along and took
my friends home for dinner.

337
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:40,917
When we become adults,

338
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:43,424
everyone has some pain tucked away.

339
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:49,560
Whether it's old or new,

340
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,192
these wounds deepen with more years.

341
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:58,777
That's how we continue to mature.

342
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:07,758
I've dealt with my share of heartbreaks...

343
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,368
and grew this way.

344
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,533
What's wrong?

345
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,579
Never mind.

346
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,242
Should I cook you some ham?

347
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:29,706
That's okay.

348
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:33,182
The plates look luxurious and pretty.

349
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,704
Jun Woo likes the Northern European style.

350
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,111
Is there not much to eat?

351
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:41,116
We seem poor without Uncle Jun Woo.

352
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:43,420
Just bear it until today.

353
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,569
I'll buy groceries and cook after work.

354
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,678
Wait till he comes back.

355
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:49,834
Put that thing down.

356
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,184
I've been busy with all the drawing.

357
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,914
Jun Woo needs some alone time.

358
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:58,272
He's looked after the family for years.

359
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:00,589
He was more than a mother.

360
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:04,058
Did things not work out
with the next-door lady?

361
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,962
Why would you care about that?

362
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:11,360
Uncle Jun Woo isn't getting younger.

363
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,914
What if he gets hitched and leaves?

364
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,863
Are you worried about starving?

365
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,699
Does everyone leave when married?

366
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,930
You can't bear the thought, right?

367
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,421
We're each on our own, then.

368
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,389
(Woori City Hall)

369
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,062
Shoddy repairs?

370
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,146
From the selection of the contractor,

371
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,713
it should be investigated.

372
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:40,723
It's bad enough that it's not running,

373
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,348
but there are even repair problems?

374
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,842
Here.

375
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:47,649
What's this?

376
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:50,298
These are bidding papers
from the contractor.

377
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,919
After doing a thorough review
since I took over,

378
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,937
there are discrepancies with
the materials used.

379
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:58,768
It should be reviewed again
despite all this time.

380
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:00,207
All right.

381
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:04,226
Are things going smoothly before
the drama selection?

382
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:05,273
Yes.

383
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:11,294
But regarding Director Shin
in the selection...

384
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:12,616
What about him?

385
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:16,229
Never mind.

386
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:19,789
I hope it's a just and fair selection.

387
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,490
- Thank you.
- Chief Ko.

388
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,944
Which color do you think is better?

389
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,183
I think this color is better.

390
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:30,479
Then I'll use this one.

391
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,726
Then why would you ask?

392
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:36,265
Your dancing was awful the other day.

393
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:37,380
You're excused.

394
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:45,019
All right, the drama selection deadline...

395
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,618
falls within this week.

396
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,906
So let's hang in there to the end...

397
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:50,801
- and get this.
- All right.

398
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:52,732
- We can do this.
- Go, team.

399
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:56,273
You've worked hard all this time.

400
00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:57,898
I hope there's good news for you.

401
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:59,692
Of course.

402
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,584
Chief Ko.

403
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:04,292
Thanks to your team's support,

404
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,681
we did a great job on the research.

405
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,723
- I'll buy you drinks.
- It's okay.

406
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:12,839
What's with that look?

407
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,515
I hope nothing goes wrong.

408
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,550
Take care.

409
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,283
Don't worry about him.

410
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,996
You've already won before the fight,

411
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:29,516
so just pretend to be in the ring.

412
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:32,135
Is that how he feels about Min Ju?

413
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:35,928
How dare he want her?

414
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,077
What?

415
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:40,324
It's nothing.

416
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:41,382
Let's go.

417
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,588
Boss.

418
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,606
The audition results are out.

419
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,364
The interviews are set for this morning.

420
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:52,364
Okay.

421
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,786
(Min Ji Seon)

422
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:55,865
What's this?

423
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:58,386
I put her on the list.

424
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,802
Should I take her out?

425
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:03,320
She seems like a great catch
with standout visuals.

426
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,935
You have a good eye.

427
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:09,435
But she didn't fill the family section.

428
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,326
She doesn't have any.

429
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:13,377
What?

430
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,394
Hello.

431
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:19,502
Hi.

432
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,539
How are you feeling?

433
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:27,846
It's okay.

434
00:28:28,614 --> 00:28:30,238
I'm still young.

435
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,565
Are you serious about this?

436
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:36,581
That's why I came.

437
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,377
You said I can come if I wanted.

438
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:41,036
Aren't you going to Canada in a month?

439
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:44,408
Of course, I lied.

440
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:46,379
I wanted to be with Jun.

441
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,484
What about now?

442
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:52,104
I got some help at the hospital.

443
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,346
Some counseling.

444
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,235
That's good.

445
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:02,112
Then I'll set you up with
the best acting teacher I know.

446
00:29:02,112 --> 00:29:03,567
So get the basics down.

447
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,712
Are you for real?

448
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:06,719
But you have to hold out.

449
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,479
It could take a long time.

450
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,377
I'm good at waiting.

451
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:13,280
Okay.

452
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,437
You know Mr. Wook and Na Joo Yeon?

453
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,636
Of course.

454
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:21,293
They learned from him, so start next week.

455
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,293
Okay?

456
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:26,344
Thank you.

457
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,402
I said thank you.

458
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:35,211
Don't you know what it means?

459
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,037
It's too early to thank me.

460
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,275
There are many steps left.

461
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,512
Tests, you know?

462
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,907
Welcome, Deputy Mayor.

463
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:55,019
I especially prepared a room.

464
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,019
A room?

465
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,789
You can enjoy some space
since you eat alone.

466
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,678
No, I'll take a seat in the hall.

467
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:02,681
Really? Then this way.

468
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:05,325
Over here.

469
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:13,983
I'm sorry, she's the Deputy Mayor.

470
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:15,142
So what?

471
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:18,774
There isn't a seat, so maybe next time.

472
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:21,272
What are you talking about?

473
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:24,024
She's my woman, you know?

474
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,334
Why are you staring at me?

475
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,231
Never mind.

476
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:39,948
Sir, we'd like two
rich soybean paste stews.

477
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,361
Yes, all right.

478
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,408
What's with your lips today?

479
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,286
Why? Don't they look good?

480
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:54,974
I mean to say...

481
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,373
You look like a new bride.

482
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:01,143
My goodness.

483
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,445
But what will we do about this
difference in status?

484
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,837
Hanging out with the Deputy Mayor,

485
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:11,980
I'm given the cold shoulder.

486
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,830
You'll have to overcome that.

487
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,083
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

488
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,071
This place has tasty organic dishes.

489
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:29,606
Wait a minute.

490
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:32,464
Bong.

491
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,677
It's been so long.

492
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:38,498
Choi Hee, you look stunning.

493
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:41,227
But who is this grandma?

494
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,931
Grandma?

495
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:49,314
Get to your waiting boyfriend.

496
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:52,141
Okay, I'll see you later.

497
00:31:57,704 --> 00:32:00,082
How many more women do you
know that are like that?

498
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:04,017
She's not a woman, but just a fan.

499
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,414
I know quite a few women,

500
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:10,543
but none have left with hard feelings.

501
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:13,627
It's more important to remove
than apply makeup,

502
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:16,518
and dramas are all about the finale
than the beginning.

503
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,511
The same goes for how love ends.

504
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:25,662
Like how we shouldn't burden others...

505
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,739
when we depart from this world.

506
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,403
Why are you talking about death
when we're still young?

507
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:31,718
That killed my appetite.

508
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,630
Then open your mouth and say, "Ah."

509
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:45,939
"Ah."

510
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:48,406
- It's too hot.
- Too hot?

511
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:49,632
Here is some water.

512
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:00,961
It's delicious.

513
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,943
Chief Ko, SBC Producer Gang called,

514
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,799
asking to have dinner since
she submitted her work.

515
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,799
Dinner?

516
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:14,123
- Great work.
- You worked hard.

517
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:17,654
It's Korean beef.

518
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,840
Korean beef is the best for dinner.

519
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,460
You worked hard.

520
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,204
Thank you for everything.

521
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:25,476
Don't mention it.

522
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:28,022
We should have given more support.

523
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,582
When will we get paid for the camera?

524
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:31,429
Why are you spoiling the day?

525
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:32,630
What?

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,045
We should address what needs addressing.

527
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,699
- It's being processed.
- That's a relief.

528
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:40,396
Drink up.

529
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,287
Did you submit your work okay?

530
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:46,914
Of course. Why?

531
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,968
Even if it doesn't turn out well,

532
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,636
please don't take it too hard.

533
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,535
I'm sure it came out great.

534
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,036
Don't worry, it won't fail.

535
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:03,052
Don't you agree?

536
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:04,670
- Of course.
- Of course.

537
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,878
Why are you so worried?

538
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,630
I hope your hard work pays off.

539
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,663
You bet.

540
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:14,902
We tried our best, so let's drink.

541
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:17,191
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

542
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:19,563
Mi Rye, you worked so hard.

543
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:22,216
I learned a lot from your great work.

544
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,315
What about me?

545
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,111
Who's going to applaud me?

546
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:32,143
That will be me.
I know how hard you worked.

547
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:33,143
Right?

548
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:34,348
I'm with you on that.

549
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,136
Then it's everyone.

550
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,173
I really hope it turns out well.

551
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:44,878
Cheers.

552
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,258
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

553
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:05,370
Why are you outside?

554
00:35:06,494 --> 00:35:08,696
It felt stuffy.

555
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,258
Is something bothering you?

556
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:17,192
No.

557
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:19,513
You went through a lot preparing for this.

558
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,642
It wasn't any trouble since it's work.

559
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:24,864
I heard you're not judging.

560
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:27,427
No, I opted out since Mi Rye is involved.

561
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:31,330
That's too bad since you're an expert.

562
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,873
You'd be valued on the panel
if it weren't for Ms. Ko.

563
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:36,189
You flatter me.

564
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:43,305
Don't you regret it?

565
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,037
How you quit your dream.

566
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:48,234
From what I heard,

567
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,828
you quit from the shock.

568
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,243
Who told you that?

569
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,948
Producer Han told me.

570
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:09,962
I hope you can let go and move on.

571
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,957
Everyone has been through
something painful...

572
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,529
they would rather forget about.

573
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,621
Since this is very important to me,

574
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:24,114
I'd like to press you for answers,

575
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:28,230
but I know that causes you pain.

576
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,607
So tell me if you can talk about it.

577
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:35,071
Maybe there was something
I didn't know about.

578
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:40,335
I just hope it won't be too late.

579
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,340
Please let me be wrong.

580
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:28,306
I pray this bad feeling isn't right.

581
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:02,592
It might be a painful memory of his past.

582
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,323
Perhaps that's why he runs away.

583
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,962
Hun, put down your phone.

584
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:28,591
Okay, Mom.

585
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:30,526
Why are you like that?

586
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,065
And is this all the food?

587
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:36,421
Hun, where does your dad exercise?

588
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:39,371
Where do you exercise?

589
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,791
Tell her I quit.

590
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,598
So where did he exercise?

591
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:47,390
Where was it?

592
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:51,638
Forget it. You talk it out. I'm tired.

593
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:55,484
Why are you prying when I quit?

594
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:57,558
Are you snooping around about me?

595
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:03,045
Goodness.

596
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,050
That's a great phrase.

597
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,779
Your words excite me this morning.

598
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,089
There is nothing more beautiful
than getting older.

599
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:25,362
Each day is new to everyone.

600
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,953
Whether dreaming in our 20s...

601
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:30,392
or living today in our 40s,

602
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,706
the excitement remains the same.

603
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,100
Richard Park.

604
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:38,750
Richard? Richard Park?

605
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:50,445
You still came.
I told you Ju Woo wasn't here.

606
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:54,319
I just got worried.

607
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,621
He's never left for this long.

608
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:05,210
It's Jun Woo.

609
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,762
He came.

610
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:07,970
- Jun Woo.
- Hurry to him.

611
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,414
How have you been?

612
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:14,073
Is Honey doing well?

613
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:16,415
Of course.

614
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:18,990
Are you okay?

615
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,305
What if I'm not?

616
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:24,984
Ta-da.

617
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,627
You went all the way to Jeju?

618
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:29,711
Yes.

619
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:33,840
Then are these hallabong I love
from Mr. Ko's orchard?

620
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,491
Of course.

621
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:39,816
You little punk.

622
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,991
You should have called or texted.

623
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,531
That really hurts.

624
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:46,109
You deserve to be hit.

625
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:48,479
I was so worried about you.

626
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,964
Welcome.

627
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,587
Professor Ma.

628
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,808
Hello, I'm Han Jeong Sik.

629
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,512
Yes, I've heard you went
to Director Shin's school.

630
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:05,559
I see.

631
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:08,120
I hope you can do me a favor
in the drama selection.

632
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,792
There's no need.

633
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,960
I hope for the best drama myself.

634
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:13,941
Of course.

635
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:15,487
- Here.
- Nice to meet you.

636
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,356
(The 1st Woori City Drama Panel)

637
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,386
The panel of judges...

638
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:45,011
are discussing a leading contender.

639
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:46,723
Is that right?

640
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:50,859
But unfortunately, it's not your network,

641
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,780
but KBN.

642
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,891
I once worked for that network.

643
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,923
Which chief producer submitted the work?

644
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:06,171
It's KBN Producer Yang Yun Seok.

645
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,937
- Chief Ko, you are here.
- Hello.

646
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:28,114
Your sign was in the path's way,

647
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:29,769
so I moved it inside.

648
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:31,123
I hope you can take care.

649
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:34,396
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll make sure.

650
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:35,607
Have a good night.

651
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,380
Three people.

652
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,530
Please give us some soju.

653
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,085
Take a seat.

654
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:43,975
We're drinking too much.

655
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:46,968
Don't be a crybaby.

656
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:48,914
Ko Sang Sik.

657
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:54,621
Producer Yang.

658
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,054
It's been so long.

659
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,198
I'm a chief producer now.

660
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:00,749
I see. Are you doing well?

661
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:01,935
Of course.

662
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,801
Why don't you join us?

663
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:09,547
No, I'm busy. You go ahead.

664
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:14,542
What's taking you? Sit down.

665
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,544
Let's have that soju.

666
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,107
There it comes.

667
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,006
All right.

668
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:28,051
No, I'll pour you a shot.

669
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:30,292
You're working so hard.

670
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:31,748
- All right.
- Okay.

671
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,911
Here are some for you.

672
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,504
Okay, cheers.

673
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:39,756
("Blooming")

674
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:42,114
Good morning.

675
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:46,935
Why are you so nervous?

676
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:49,584
They will announce the drama pick today.

677
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:51,275
We have 15 minutes left.

678
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,392
- Mi Rye, what are you doing?
- What?

679
00:43:56,941 --> 00:44:00,663
I do this whenever I'm nervous.

680
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:04,709
That's new. How unique and pretty.

681
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:05,744
Give it here.

682
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,629
So this is how it turns out.

683
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:14,206
It's cute, right?

684
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,816
(The 1st Woori City Drama Selection)

685
00:44:29,078 --> 00:44:30,698
There are five minutes left.

686
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:02,153
- Good work.
- Thanks for everything.

687
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:08,501
Chief Ko, it's connected.

688
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:09,501
Okay.

689
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,701
What drama will be picked?

690
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:15,871
I hope it's fun.

691
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,478
Something that shows off the city.

692
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:18,951
How much longer?

693
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,238
It's about time.

694
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:23,316
(Woori City Drama's winner)

695
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:24,959
It came out.

696
00:45:25,997 --> 00:45:27,978
(KBN's "The Name of Us" by Yang Yun Seok)

697
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:29,685
What?

698
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,325
What's wrong with this?

699
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:33,694
How did this even happen?

700
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,328
Gang Min Ju, did we both get dropped?

701
00:45:38,795 --> 00:45:40,436
KBN got picked.

702
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:43,061
It's the team we supported.

703
00:45:43,061 --> 00:45:45,091
- This is great.
- Yay!

704
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:48,396
SBC submitted two, but both lost.

705
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:49,909
I told you it would get it.

00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:51,638
(Produced by Yang Yun Seok)

707
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,239
Yang Yun Seok?

708
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:57,922
Sir, I'm a chief producer now.

709
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,812
Why don't you join us?

710
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:13,904
Great work.

711
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,230
Director Shin, you did well.

712
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,983
No, I haven't done much.

713
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,568
Now it's another start.

714
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,991
Great job. Let's get to our places.

715
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,751
Goodness.

716
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:28,399
I can't believe it.

717
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,197
You did well.

718
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:37,711
You worked hard.

719
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:41,361
Are you okay?

720
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,762
I've learned a lot and had fun.

721
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:50,018
I thought we'd get it.

722
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:00,024
What? You didn't get picked?

723
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,024
No.

724
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:03,623
I thought after ending it with Jun Woo,

725
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:05,633
you were all about this work.

726
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:07,102
I did work hard.

727
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:09,840
Yes, you know Min Ju.

728
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,554
But even my best wasn't enough.

729
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:13,823
I'm not as strong as I was myself.

730
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:16,830
It's a struggle to teach and work out.

731
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,342
Me, too.

732
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:20,309
The education curriculum is evolving,

733
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,534
along with the trends in exams.

734
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:25,153
But my mind can't keep up with it.

735
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:27,151
What would happen to me now?

736
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:28,551
How will I support myself after I quit?

737
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:30,750
They couldn't possibly fire you.

738
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,519
No, it's serious.
This is my biggest crisis yet.

739
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,109
Cheer up. There must be a way.

740
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:39,623
Yes, remember when a cable TV
wanted to scout you?

741
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,675
Scout me?

742
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:46,394
Maybe you should've taken the offer.

743
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:54,379
(KBN)

744
00:47:55,936 --> 00:47:57,202
Don't even get me started.

745
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,987
Producer Han hasn't changed a bit.

746
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,923
What? What do you mean?

747
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:11,464
Are you sure our pitch got dropped?

748
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:14,568
What's so great about KBN that
you'd reject our work?

749
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:17,648
The panel was fair and square.

750
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:20,944
Don't be upset. There will be a next time.

751
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,671
If mine wasn't good enough,

752
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:25,011
you should have picked Producer Gang's.

753
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,240
Is this enough?

754
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:32,335
I'll hang up now.

755
00:48:39,013 --> 00:48:41,256
What can we do? It's decided.

756
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:42,568
What did I tell you?

757
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,389
I'm a goner if this fails.

758
00:48:44,899 --> 00:48:46,423
I should start packing.

759
00:48:48,828 --> 00:48:51,054
Gang Min Ju. Are you okay?

760
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:54,883
I'm sorry, sir.

761
00:48:54,883 --> 00:48:57,405
I tried my best but came short.

762
00:48:58,515 --> 00:48:59,614
Goodness.

763
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:03,313
Division Head. Boss.

764
00:49:03,313 --> 00:49:05,735
- What's going on?
- Producer Han's got picked.

765
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:07,797
What?

766
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:09,403
The Woori City Drama.

767
00:49:09,403 --> 00:49:12,548
Producer Han's pitch got picked.

768
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:13,612
Are you sure?

769
00:49:13,612 --> 00:49:16,020
The city hall reposted it online.

770
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,276
The KBN drama was submitted twice

771
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:20,380
at another city selection.

772
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,108
He pitched the same work to another city?

773
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:24,372
Yes.

774
00:49:24,372 --> 00:49:27,620
So the next highest score bumped up,

775
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,405
which is Producer Han's.

776
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:33,308
What are you waiting for? Go check.

777
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:34,308
All right.

778
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:39,372
That's good to know.

779
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,035
I know.

780
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:43,461
At least our network grabbed it.

781
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:46,869
Don't worry. You worked hard.

782
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:58,653
- Good work.
- You worked hard.

783
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:03,671
Deputy Mayor.

784
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,739
Welcome, Chief Ko.
Did you catch the repost?

785
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,813
This is wrong.

786
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,441
What do you mean it's wrong?

787
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:14,283
This win isn't valid.

788
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:18,681
Chief Ko, what are you talking about?

789
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,535
Do you know how painstaking
it was for our panel...

790
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:24,076
to finalize this selection?

791
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,695
Let's see the post on the monitor.

792
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:37,474
Okay, you must be happy.

793
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:47,042
(The SBC Network's "Love and Cooking")

794
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:54,653
The KBN Network's "The Name of Us"
was double-submitted to another contest,

795
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,352
which makes it disqualified.

796
00:50:56,352 --> 00:51:01,644
Therefore, the SBC's "Love and Cooking"
has been chosen as the final winner...

797
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:02,876
through a fair and clear process.

798
00:51:03,922 --> 00:51:05,666
- What's going on?
- Boss.

799
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,992
You guys did great.

800
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:22,254
Yes. Congratulations.

801
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:26,609
I can't make anything of this.

802
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:28,241
What happened?

803
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:30,723
May I speak with you now?

804
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:36,109
No, let's meet outside.
There is something I must say.

805
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,582
Okay, then.

806
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,628

807
00:51:58,258 --> 00:51:59,258
What?

808
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:03,685
Ko Sang Sik is meeting with whom?

809
00:52:04,979 --> 00:52:06,237
Good grief.

810
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:18,618
Yes, Deputy Mayor.

811
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:20,401
I saw your announcement.

812
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:22,650
There was a bit of confusion.

813
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,273
I'd like to apologize for that.

814
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:28,146
No worries. I'm glad for the good news.

815
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,604
I'll see you tomorrow.

816
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:32,406
Min Ju. Gang Min Ju!

817
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,854
Are you going to meet with Ko Sang Sik?

818
00:52:46,854 --> 00:52:47,854
Yes.

819
00:52:48,613 --> 00:52:50,554
Are you acting furious because I won?

820
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:53,324
Gang Min Ju, listen carefully.

821
00:52:53,324 --> 00:52:56,788
I know he appears to like you,

822
00:52:56,788 --> 00:53:00,176
but I can't hold my tongue any longer.

823
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,724
What is this about?

824
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,603
You don't know that man.

825
00:53:05,603 --> 00:53:08,602
He was at the fire with Jang Eun Ho,

826
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,818
the guy you planned to marry.

827
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,218
Eun Ho died because of him,
do you know that?

828
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:17,874
What?

829
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:43,298
I can't be a coward anymore.

830
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,096
Even if it means losing her,
I must tell her.

831
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:49,433
The whole truth.

832
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:59,374
Cut. Okay.

833
00:53:59,374 --> 00:54:01,423
Okay, to the next location.

834
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:02,462

- Good work.

00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,590
Eun Ho, help me with this.

837
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,416
Okay, I'm coming.

838
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,372
- What needs to be done?
- Put this here.

839
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,673
Now, that's a cool bracelet.

840
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,344
- Is it from your wife?
- That's right.

841
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:20,300
Good grief, I want to get married already.
I envy you so much.

842
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,855
I heard you set the date.

843
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:23,731
You have to come.

844
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,821
Come and see my beautiful bride.

845
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:28,363
Of course, congratulations.

846
00:54:28,363 --> 00:54:30,827
My girlfriend recently got into SBC.

847
00:54:30,827 --> 00:54:32,446
- The SBC?
- Yes.

848
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:34,806
She wants to produce dramas like you.

849
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:37,807
I popped the question before anyone.

850
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,862
That's good. You did well.

851
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:43,286
I'm meeting her after today.
How about a drink?

852
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:44,446
No.

853
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:47,022
- Why not?
- I have to meet my wife.

854
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,094
Let's go.

855
00:54:48,094 --> 00:54:49,854
You're such a devoted husband.

856
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:51,329
- Bring that over.
- Okay.

857
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:55,446
Producer Han, what are you doing?

858
00:54:55,446 --> 00:54:56,703
Isn't it obvious?

859
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:59,447
We need to set up the electricity
to wrap up the shoot.

860
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:01,345
Let's wait for the generator truck.

861
00:55:02,774 --> 00:55:05,166
It's hot, and look at the time.

862
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,758
How can we wait until then?

863
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,997
It left shortly, so it'll be here soon.

864
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:13,174
Director, how long do we have to wait?

865
00:55:13,174 --> 00:55:16,344
I haven't slept for five days.

866
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:18,542
Okay, all right.

867
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:20,197
Let's do this.

868
00:55:20,844 --> 00:55:22,101
Let's start rolling.

869
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:27,054
Honey, I'll be waiting nearby.

870
00:55:29,763 --> 00:55:33,649
I won't give up my dream.

871
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,845
Cut. No good.

872
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:41,434
Why? It was good acting.

873
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:44,250
Yes, but with more emotion.

874
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,541
One more time.

875
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:50,861
Yes?

876
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,389
No, it's almost over. I'll be there.

877
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:55,389
Okay.

878
00:55:58,676 --> 00:56:01,699
Sang Sik, you shoot this last scene.

879
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:02,699
What?

880
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:05,324
The division head and president
are discussing programming.

881
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:06,621
I have to be there.

882
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:08,010
My neck is on the line here.

883
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,611
You shouldn't leave during the shoot.

884
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:12,594
But we need to air it tonight.

885
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:14,898
Stop complaining and get it done.

886
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:17,001
What's an assistant director?

887
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:18,738
You take responsibility when I'm away.

888
00:56:18,738 --> 00:56:21,946
Then I'll wait for the generator truck.

889
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:24,662
Sure, if you can make the airtime.

890
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:28,546
Look, there's been an issue with Team B.

891
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:31,906
I have to hurry, so roll till the end.

892
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:33,468
Work hard.

893
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,034
What's taking the generator truck?

894
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:39,435
There was a road accident,

895
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:42,929
so I made a call to another place.

896
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:44,932
But they can't make it right away.

897
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:54,559
What's wrong?

898
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,163
No, it's nothing.

899
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,590
Hurry, let's roll it.

900
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,363
Okay, wait a minute.

901
00:57:02,428 --> 00:57:03,876
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

902
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:05,012
What?

903
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:06,783
Sorry. I'll check what's wrong.

904
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:13,365
Hurry, get out!

905
00:57:14,011 --> 00:57:15,255
Get out, everyone!

906
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,497
Hurry! Get out!

907
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,209
Get out!

908
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:29,670
Are you okay?

909
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,066
Hurry! Go!

910
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,842
It's hot!

911
00:57:35,523 --> 00:57:36,523
Are you okay?

912
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:40,267
Get out!

913
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:49,526
Eun Ho!

914
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:58,234
Eun Ho, no!

915
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:05,634
Hurry and escape.

916
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:06,912
Don't let go!

917
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:10,142
Eun Ho!

918
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,125
Eun Ho!

919
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:35,316
All he did was work hard,
and it cost his life!

920
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:37,267
- You killed him!
- Mom.

921
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,643
Tell him to come out!

922
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:40,403
Tell him to come out!

923
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:44,104
Bring back my son!

924
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,622
How could this happen?

925
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:53,063
How could this happen to my son?

926
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,377
How could this even happen?

927
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:05,564
("Paradise for Youth")

(KBN Ko Sang Sik)

929
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:17,543
Now, Ko Sang Sik.

930
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:22,630
How would it make me look if you leave?

931
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,432
This is killing me.

932
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,448
It was just an accident.

933
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,938
Why are you taking the blame?

934
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,921
It was an accident!

935
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:17,401
You don't know that man.

936
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,039
He was at the fire with Jang Eun Ho,

937
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,912
the guy you planned to marry.

938
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:26,658
Eun Ho died because of him,
do you know that?

939
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:53,142
Save it. My crew will be here soon.

940
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:54,952
Why are you acting up again?

941
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,996
You never said it would be locked.

942
01:00:56,996 --> 01:01:00,265
Weren't you taught to say
sorry or thank you?

943
01:01:00,974 --> 01:01:02,781
No stepping into the fountain.

944
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:05,118
You shouldn't ever come here alone.

945
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:06,626
Are you looking out for me?

946
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:19,838
You punk!

947
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:21,109
This isn't the booze talking.

948
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:23,254
I'm a thief, fraud, and opportunist!

949
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:24,367
So what?

950
01:01:27,294 --> 01:01:29,745
Do you have feelings for me?

951
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:41,682
I'm sorry.

952
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,628
I should have done something.

953
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,468
I'm sorry.

954
01:01:46,778 --> 01:01:50,447
The bracelet he clung to at the end...

955
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:52,043
Wasn't it yours?

956
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:54,818
- I'm sorry.
- Ko Sang Sik.

Ko Sang Sik.

958
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,571
I've got so much to tell you.

959
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:33,926
I don't want to hear it.

960
01:02:35,738 --> 01:02:37,068
What do you mean?

961
01:02:37,593 --> 01:02:39,965
The reason you couldn't tell me.

962
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,877
I know that now.

963
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:48,026
And it wasn't just out of guilt.

964
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:51,663
Gang Min Ju.

965
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:56,226
But what makes me angry is this.

966
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:04,064
Despite it all,

967
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,832
Ko Sang Sik,

968
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,258

You can't stand in my way.

972
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:24,159
I'll take you down with one strike.

973
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,161
Bang!

974
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,161
You can leave.

975
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:28,469
Is this how you play the field?

976
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:29,773
I'm so happy.

977
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:32,557
There is someone genuinely thrilled
for me.

978

Are you still feeling uneasy
about Producer Gang?

979

We can bury our past for each other.

I can't pretend that nothing happened.
