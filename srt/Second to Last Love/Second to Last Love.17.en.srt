1
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,846
What happened?

2
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,622
(Audit Results)

3
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,528
(Grade five Ko Sang Sik
demoted to grade six)

4
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,138
You got demoted?

5
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,840
This is absurd.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,283
How could they do this?

7
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,224
- Don't worry.
- How could I not worry?

8
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,733
For the time being,

9
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,800
I can always raise objections.

10
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:23,120
There is a way to fight back.

11
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:38,863
(Second to Last Love)

12
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,330
I can't believe this.

13
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,293
We'll get the full story when he arrives.

14
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,606
The lady next door caused all this.

15
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,380
There was even that scandal.

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,761
Why are you blaming her?

17
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,945
If she hadn't moved here, he'd be okay.

18
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,014
No matter who moved in,

19
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,824
we should respect his feelings.

20
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:02,360
You know who my husband cheated with.

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,849
It was her friend...

22
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,713
That's enough already.

23
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:09,129
Something isn't right here.

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,056
I feel like someone is setting him up.

25
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,967
Exactly. This isn't like him.

26
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,769
But love can make you blind.

27
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,000
Look at my husband.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,391
Are you saying our brother is guilty?

29
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:20,461
I didn't mean it that way.

30
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,095
- Sang Sik.
- Hello.

31
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,751
Are you okay, Sang Sik?

32
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,428
Don't worry, it's no big deal.

33
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,396
You got this handled?

34
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,081
Yes.

35
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,475
Let's have dinner together. Come up.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,373
I really hope it's nothing.

37
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:51,277
Why come all the way here
instead of just drinking soju?

38
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:54,343
I've been marking the days for this.

39
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:55,810
The street diner won't cut it.

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,236
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

41
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,914
Because of Ko Sang Sik's audit results?

42
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,164
Exactly.

43
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:04,888
That guy, Director Shin.

44
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,338
I'm suspicious of him.

45
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:10,057
Why would you doubt someone
who works hard?

46
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,561
After you helped with my budget,

47
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,410
I'm also skeptical about you.

48
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,993
You can't be serious.

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,606
How can you question my act
of pure kindness?

50
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:24,253
No wonder a bad reputation never fades.

51
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:27,262
If you care about me at all,

52
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:28,497
tell me the truth.

53
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,256
About what?

54
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:32,867
The ferry.

55
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,703
The one in Forest Village?

56
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:38,751
Someone else was behind those
dodgy deals and repairs.

57
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,996
So why blame it on someone else?

58
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,772
Are you saying it's Director Shin?

59
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,406
Tell me if you know anything.

60
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,535
If not,

61
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,996
I'll make sure the police and reporters...

62
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,959
hear about your score tampering.

63
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,255
Goodness, Gang Min Ju.

64
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,581
You must really like Ko Sang Sik.

65
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:11,579
(Grade five Ko Sang Sik
demoted to grade six)

66
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,244
Sang Sik, come out and eat.

67
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:17,297
Okay.

68
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,390
Are you sure it's nothing?

69
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,048
Yes, don't worry.

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,961
It smells good.

71
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:39,511
Demoted?

72
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,856
Demoted? This is...

73
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:42,895
Sang Sik.

74
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,599
- Sang Sik.
- Okay, let's eat.

75
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,091
Sang Sik, what's this?

76
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:48,666
Give it here.

77
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,814
What is it?

78
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,336
- Sang Sik.
- What is this?

79
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,621
Why did you look in my drawer?

80
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,716
Well, I...

81
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,057
Demoted?

82
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,028
You said it was handled.

83
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,025
It's just a notice.

84
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,058
I can raise an objection.

85
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:06,341
They sometimes slip up without checking.

86
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,824
It's nothing. Just eat.

87
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,566
- Sit down.
- Okay.

88
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,176
This looks good.

89
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,176
Wait.

90
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:20,644
What now?

91
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,912
No, it's nothing.

92
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,053
Never mind.

93
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:45,333
It is indeed pricey, like I heard.

94
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,292
Given your son's grades
and scholastic aptitude,

95
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,196
I suggest Beijing's IT College...

96
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,270
or Sanghai's College of Economics Trade.

97
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,421
I heard you also handle loans.

98
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:00,384
Isn't your brother a public servant?

99
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:03,216
Yes, he's the Regional Tourism Chief.

100
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,245
I see.

101
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,416
You need these papers for a public loan.

102
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,658
A copy of his ID, resident registration,

103
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:13,233
real estate contract, lease contract...

104
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,332
Lease?

105
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:18,517
Yes, I can get all of these.

106
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,195
Hello, this is Park Hun's mother.

107
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:32,614
I have something to ask you.

108
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,414
It's about the public loan I got before.

109
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:38,887
If there are issues with my brother,

110
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,941
I was wondering what would happen.

111
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,488
What issues?

112
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:46,591
Like if my brother gets demoted...

113
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,030
or expulsed as a disciplinary measure.

114
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,918
I was wondering what would happen.

115
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,253
That wouldn't matter.

116
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:55,206
The loan is based on when it was issued.

117
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,213
Is that right?

118
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:58,646
That's a relief.

119
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:01,247
I thought I needed to pay it back.

120
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,102
No.

121
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:05,041
Okay, thanks for your help.

122
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,436
- What are you doing?
- My goodness!

123
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,028
You scared me.

124
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,070
Do you know about the mess
concerning my brother?

125
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,543
Is he inside?

126
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,204
Did you just get back?

127
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,675
- I hope I didn't disturb you.
- Not at all.

128
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,248
Are you worried about me?

129
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,024
I met with Producer Han.

130
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,307
I thought I might find out something.

131
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,634
So, did you get anything?

132
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,272
It seems like he knows something,

133
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:49,600
but he wouldn't talk.

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,440
Even if he does know,

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,944
why would he tell you?

136
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,087
I'll get to it somehow.

137
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,354
Raising your objection
won't make this fight any easier.

138
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,633
You can leave it to me.

139
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,693
Just focus on producing your drama.

140
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:07,391
Start by meeting with the contractors
that bid on the ferry repairs.

141
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:10,390
You could get some inside scoop
from the ones who lost the bid.

142
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,506
Also, contact everyone who worked
on the botched contract.

143
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,779
I'll do everything to help you.

144
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:31,000
With you here backing me,

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,583
I can manage more than enough.

146
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,545
There isn't any time to waste.

147
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:37,594
We should gather all the evidence
and clear your good name.

148
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:39,177
Yes, all right.

149
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,965
Seeing how you're worked up,
I definitely will.

150
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:46,337
About Director Shin Seok Gi,

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,346
what issue does he have against you?

152
00:08:58,142 --> 00:08:59,425
(Woori City Hall)

153
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,032
(Insulted and sexually harassed
contractual worker)

154
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:10,195
(Expulse Director Shin Seok Gi
of Economics and Trade!)

155
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,123
What is all that?

156
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,260
Insulted? Sexually harassed?

157
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:22,782
Wait, when did I sexually harass you?

158
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,726
When did I...

159
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,376
When did I sexually harass you?

160
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:36,109
I feel humiliated when you
touch me like that.

161
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,775
That's sexual harassment.

162
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:39,684
Goodness.

163
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:42,068
You seem to remember belittling me...

164
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,109
for being a mere contract worker,

165
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,951
and yet you forget about the harassment?

166
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:50,430
At the dinner the day you got appointed,

167
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,412
you said my behind is too small
for bearing kids.

168
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,333
Did you say that or not?

169
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:59,573
That was because...

170
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:02,787
I was joking about you being slow
with a heavy behind,

171
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,613
but you mentioned it being small.

172
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,404
That's what led to it.

173
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,166
Clearly, that's harassment.

174
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,125
Will you shut up?

175
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,404
Do you want to lose your job?

176
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,849
I handed in my resignation.

177
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:19,158
And watch your tone with me.

178
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:21,295
I'm not your daughter.

179
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:23,406
I can't believe you...

180
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,976
Step inside if you don't want to
get yourself expulsed.

181
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,480
Good grief.

182
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:36,645
(Chief Ko is cuter than a squirrel)

183
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:37,945
(Woori City's true worker and star)

184
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:38,968
(Love you)

185
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,462
Ms. Han.

186
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:48,023
Will you keep me standing
facing the squirrel?

187
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,614
You did enough, so get back.

188
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:05,580
Does that mean Chief Ko
is facing a demotion?

189
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,548
I can't believe that would happen
to someone like him.

190
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,061
We might get disbanded,

191
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,740
and this team could be restructured.

192
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,093
Are you serious?

193
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,429
- Good morning.
- Chief Ko.

194
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,600
Chief Ko.

195
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,017
Ms Han.

196
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:21,140
- Ms. Han.
- Ms. Han.

197
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:29,420
Here, handle the backlogged work.

198
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:30,881
Chief Ko.

199
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,290
Don't be rattled by baseless rumors,

200
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,401
but deliver your tasks flawlessly.

201
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,578
Now isn't the time for mistakes.

202
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:38,996
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

203
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,959
Just because you're on contract...

204
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,818
doesn't mean you can walk out
without checking with me.

205
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,152
I read the article about you...

206
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:52,823
and figured you were having enough stress.

207
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,537
So I decided to return.

208
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:56,384
That's good to hear.

209
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,336
But if you pull another stunt like this,

210
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:00,857
I'll process your resignation.

211
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,022
If you need any documents
about your matter,

212
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:08,218
I'll fetch them whenever you ask.

213
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,865
- Let's get to work.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:16,782
Boss.

215
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,997
So what's the update?

216
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,596
Why is Chief Ko getting the heat
for the ferry issue?

217
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,458
He should act fast and clear it up.

218
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,237
This came out of nowhere.

219
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,619
- Lodging for the shoots?
- Yes.

220
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,475
Producer Nam keeps mixing up the dates.

221
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,620
It might be best to lodge together...

222
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,787
and film for a week in Woori City.

223
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,059
Then let's do that.

224
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,931
Check with the Regional Tourism Team
for any suitable places.

225
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,395
I'll do that.

226
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,618
But what about you?

227
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,099
Is there a way to clear his name?

228
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,283
I'll meet with the drama selection panel.

229
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:51,926
The selection panel?

230
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:55,748
The one who rigged the scoring?

231
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,705
Yes, look here.

232
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,589
Professor Ma Seok Gyo lost his post...

233
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:06,677
and is laying low after investigations.

234
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:11,222
How would you know where to look?

235
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,794
Hello.

236
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:28,734
Yes?

237
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,734
I'm Chief Ko Sang Sik,
who requested the ferry repairs.

238
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,705
Right, I see.

239
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,602
But what brings you here?

240
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:38,272
We're trying to track down
the initial contractor.

241
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:42,825
Wouldn't the city hall be in the know
since they commissioned the task?

242
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,329
The contractors on our list...

243
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:47,221
don't even deal with such materials.

244
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,465
We're looking for people
that botched it up.

245
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,970
It's a tricky business with
all the outsourcing.

246
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,807
Well, I'm not sure.

247
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,046
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,102
Hold on.

249
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:01,557
If you provide us with information,

250
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:02,965
no harm will come your way.

251
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:05,336
The ceiling collapse could have
killed someone.

252
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,784
Then, let's discuss it there.

253
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,501
What an embarrassment.

254
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,198
How could you mess with the scoring?

255
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,472
There is no evidence that I was involved.

256
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:26,831
Why would I even do such a thing?

257
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,614
I just wanted to have your back.

258
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:32,292
You said paying for your son's
tuition was a struggle.

259
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:37,833
Yes, but that wasn't right.

260
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,713
If Gang Min Ju didn't get it,

261
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,817
you had to pack up and leave.

262
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:45,185
What if Professor Ma, who rigged it,

263
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,963
suddenly decides to come clean?

264
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:50,468
Then, you can back me up.

265
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:54,028
Even if it blows up and reaches
the disciplinary committee,

266
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:55,910
let me off with a warning.

267
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,935
Please.

268
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,141
Goodness.

269
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,280
There you are.

270
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,210
Gang Min Ju.

271
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,389
What are you doing here?

272
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,103
It won't be easy to track him in hiding.

273
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,462
That's why I came here.

274
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:20,429
How would I know where he is?

275
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:22,751
Sir.

276
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:27,086
You decide between me and Producer Han.

277
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,150
What are you talking about?

278
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,063
Since I've secured the Woori City Drama,

279
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,578
I can jump ship and make it elsewhere.

280
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,529
My team is on board if that happens.

281
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,034
Why are you doing this?

282
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,331
I need an answer.

283
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:45,277
You know me.

284
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,828
It's you, Gang Min Ju.

285
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:49,903
Spit it out already.

286
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,445
I honestly don't know.

287
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,375
If not, I'll blow the whistle and leave.

288
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,548
Then I would lose you both.

289
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:01,965
You'd better tell her.

290
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,822
Hello.

291
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,053
Who are you?

292
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:37,539
I competed in the Woori City Drama...

293
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,053
as SBC's Producer Gang Min Ju.

294
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:44,170
You secured a win after the review.

295
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,739
Why are you even here?

296
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,517
I need your assistance.

297
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,890
I'm aware that you have resigned,

298
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,486
but you should reclaim some honor.

299
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,850
I've faced the consequences
after the investigations.

300
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,975
What's the use of honor now?

301
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,426
Why did you take all the blame?

302
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,095
Is there something you couldn't say...

303
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,001
and was bribed into silence for?

304
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:15,717
If you tell me who wanted
the scores rigged,

305
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,465
I promise to keep you safe...

306
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,930
What are you talking about?

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,460
You should go.

308
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:41,962
Hello.

309
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,559
Can you tell me which room
Ma Dong Seok is in?

310
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:21,301
Are you Professor Ma's son?

311
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,572
Good heavens.

312
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,721
I have something to say.

313
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,860
Come to my room if you're curious.

314
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,703
When did she prepare this?

315
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,200
You should still read it.

316
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,346
It hits you differently from before.

317
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:52,964
Okay, leave it there.

318
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,031
- I'll put it here.
- Okay.

319
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,986
You didn't see the note in there?

320
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:00,985
Well.

321
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:09,079
Are you all friends taking this class?

322
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,574
Yes, you're friendly, as they say,

323
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:13,983
and super good-looking.

324
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,640
- I look forward to your class.
- Sure, thank you.

325
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,130
Those sneaky minxes.

326
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,226
Why are all the newbies single?

327
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,627
What are you grumbling alone?

328
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:28,156
Is this person your girlfriend?

329
00:19:30,098 --> 00:19:32,532
You two look great together.

330
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,701
Yes, we've been together for 20 years.

331
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,229
So please be careful.

332
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:38,726
It's hands-off and cautious in class,

333
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,817
and there should be no touching involved.

334
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,310
Your girlfriend is funny.

335
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,896
How adorable she is.

336
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:54,223
You won't get anything even if you come.

337
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,847
Isn't this your latest published book?

338
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:13,632
I noticed a passage at the end of it.

339
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:16,581
"After losing my wife,"

340
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,264
"I've realized this as a single father."

341
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,022
"For my son facing a terminal illness,"

342
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,471
"even honor that I value so much..."

343
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,122
"can became something I could put aside."

344
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,888
What's your point?

345
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,103
For your son's medical expenses,

346
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,178
you seem to have complied unwillingly.

347
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,326
Before coming here today,

348
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:44,537
I met with your son.

349
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:52,175
He wanted you to have this.

350
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:12,868
After reading that passage in your book,

351
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:14,415
your son was deeply saddened.

352
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,468
It pained him to see his dear father...

353
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,687
give up on such a cherished value.

354
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,720
He wants you to always make him proud.

355
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,100
There is no need for a public confession.

356
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,368
A simple recording or note is enough.

357
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,995
Just something to launch investigations.

358
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:48,242
Why are you asking me for this?

359
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,017
As you did for your family,

360
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,227
another is forced to compromise his honor.

361
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,794
Are you referring to Chief Ko?

362
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,404
Yes.

363
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:11,523
He is suspended from duty
due to the situation,

364
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:14,266
but many want him back at work.

365
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,971
He is indispensable to the community.

366
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,858
Yes, all right.

367
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:29,236
Thank you for looking it up.

368
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:32,258
What did he say?

369
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:33,349
We found the right contractor.

370
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:35,770
It's a good thing
we took some inside photos...

371
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,568
when the ferry's ceiling caved in.

372
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,210
That's good.

373
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,361
Now, we can address the shoddy repair.

374
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,026
But what about the favored company
that declared bankruptcy?

375
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:47,122
They covered the tracks after
using another name as decoy.

376
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:49,129
After profiting on the ferry,

377
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,201
they probably switched to another target.

378
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:52,683
We must track them down.

379
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:56,628
Yes?

380
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,864
I'm outside working. What's up?

381
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,771
Professor Ma sent me a file today.

382
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,208
A file? What file?

383
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,226
In the drama selection process,

384
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,976
he struck up a dual contract
with Director Shin...

385
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,806
and promised to tamper with the scores.

386
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,153
Is that true?

387
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,999
How did you know where he was?

388
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,180
I have my ways.

389
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,606
Okay, I'll see you later.

390
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,227
Is it good news?

391
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:28,297
Producer Gang Min Ju met Professor Ma
who tampered with the contest scores,

392
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:30,831
I don't know how she persuaded him,
but she got her sources.

393
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:34,231
Producer Gang is sure impressive.

394
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:37,233
Is this the power of love?

395
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,600
Will this work in your favor?

396
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:48,525
It's helpful, but how did you get it?

397
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,353
Well, you see...

398
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,174
Being sincere got through to him.

399
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,268
What?

400
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:58,338
You know how I'm a troubleshooter.

401
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:02,057
But I've changed since meeting you.

402
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,870
Now, when I handle issues,

403
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,953
I put all my heart into it.

404
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:11,873
Are you saying I'm a good influence?

405
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:13,687
Of course.

406
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:17,521
It must have taken up a lot
of your work time.

407
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:20,768
Yes, there isn't even time for dates.

408
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:23,579
What a disappointment.
Have you got any place in mind?

409
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:30,082
Having you here is all I need.

410
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,928
I hope this issue gets settled...

411
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:35,139
and gives you a break.

412
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,139
Why?

413
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,890
Can't I resign and hang out at home?

414
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,080
What?

415
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,872
Then we can spend all day together,

416
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,201
and you won't have to run around
sorting out my mess.

417
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:49,174
I would love that,

418
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:51,406
but the locals would resent me.

419
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,406
What?

420
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:55,348
Because they count on you.

421
00:24:57,755 --> 00:25:00,337
How did I end up competing against...

422
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:03,218
the city folks instead of women?

423
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,417
If you're against the city residents,

424
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,899
- I'm against the entire country.
- What?

425
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,611
Because everyone watches your dramas.

426
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,084
So, if you slack off with me,

427
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,243
all the viewers waiting for your work...

428
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:18,236
- would hate me for it.
- Goodness.

429
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,538
Let's get something delicious.

430
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:25,874
That sounds great.

431
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,210
(Woori City Hall)

432
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,269
Here you go.

433
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:33,001
The city initiated repairs on the ferry...

434
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,329
in anticipation of the press conference,

435
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,555
but those repairs
mostly concentrated on...

436
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,865
the collapsed ceiling and cracking walls
created by previous repairs.

437
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:41,697
As for the windows smashed by hail,

438
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:44,536
expert assessments indicate
previous flawed workmanship.

439
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:47,435
And here.

440
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:51,975
Workers from the favored subcontractor...

441
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,158
have furnished signed affidavits...

442
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:57,055
to address and prevent such practices,

443
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,697
which serve as evidence of subpar repairs.

444
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:03,578
And there was no inflation
of costs in our budget.

445
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:06,656
This projected total amount
was deemed necessary.

446
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:07,984
If you read through the emails,

447
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,135
you'll find that we engaged
experts on this issue...

448
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,169
and received detailed cost analyses.

449
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,700
Good work.

450
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,282
- I'll look over this.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:44,067
You really did your homework.

452
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:48,162
As expected, you never miss a beat.

453
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,177
I can tell you're nervous.

454
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,553
Our meetings like this are numbered,

455
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:57,699
so you should brace yourself.

456
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,458
What are you talking about?

457
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:05,643
I needed to get through this
to send you packing.

458
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,175
By the way,

459
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:13,289
you should catch the news today.

460
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,497
The news?

461
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,878
In an internal review that concerns...

462
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,750
the shoddy ferry operations,

463
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,773
Chief Ko has voiced allegations
of bribery.

464
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:34,614
In response, the city's Audit Team...

465
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:37,135
has found that the person in question...

466
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:40,621
had received rebates to grant favors,

467
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:43,044
and more investigations are underway.

468
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:45,897
That's a relief.

469
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,169
See? I told you so.

470
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,289
I told you it was something fishy.

471
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:54,010
Does this mean that our brother
won't be penalized?

472
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,443
Of course. There is no one like him.

473
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:58,219
Yes, but you never know.

474
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,778
There might be others after him.

475
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:03,009
That would be terrible.

476
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,625
What about Hun?

477
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,365
Hun? What about him?

478
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
It's nothing.

479
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,317
You're not planning on sending Hun
to study abroad, are you?

480
00:28:12,827 --> 00:28:14,412
No.

481
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,211
Why would I do such a thing?

482
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:20,015
My hands are already full
with my husband's mess.

483
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:35,838
Unlock the door.

484
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,772
Are you in some spy movie?

485
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,442
It's not like we're having an affair.

486
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:50,734
We are, now that everyone knows.

487
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,827
I came to confront you.

488
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:56,363
Why did you deceive me?

489
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:59,467
How could you do this to me?

490
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,598
This is clearly a scam.

491
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:04,067
I couldn't help it.

492
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,098
Why are you so unashamed and confident?

493
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:09,796
No amount of apologies can make it right.

494
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,820
We won't get caught again.

495
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:14,581
What?

496
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,088
Ae Gyeong, I can't live without you.

497
00:29:20,088 --> 00:29:21,936
What we have...

498
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:23,705
is akin to a companionship.

499
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:26,406
Life companions, you know?

500
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,942
My goodness.

501
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,850
This is ridiculous.

502
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,591
If you want to do whatever you want,

503
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,159
why do you even have writers?

504
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,519
That's why I'm bringing it up.

505
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,981
I said, no. I'm against changing it.

506
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,766
That's enough already!

507
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:46,548
The chief producer has arrived.

508
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,150
I called her for backup.

509
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:50,434
Producer Nam, why are you pushing it?

510
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,148
I'm not being pushy.

511
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:54,332
Even I've signed off the script.

512
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:55,725
It seems good enough.

513
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,731
But it can be tweaked to add
more drama on site.

514
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,579
I don't want it dramatized.

515
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,056
Just read more into the emotions.

516
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,271
What should we do now?

517
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:07,167
It's up to the director to clash
or reconcile with her.

518
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,639
Just don't leave everyone hanging.

519
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,728
Anyway, I'm going to stop writing
if you change a single word.

521
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:15,819
So you deal with it.

522
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:20,465
Goodness, she's pushing it too far.

523
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:22,240
Ms. Ko is so much better.

524
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,118
- Just start rolling.
- Okay.

525
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,542
Let's start the shoot.

526
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,104
- Get ready.
- Okay.

527
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:36,737
What's all this?

528
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,165
Ye Ji, I'm sorry.

529
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:41,154
I apologize from deep down.

530
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:42,881
For what?

531
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:46,056
I acted impulsively that day...

532
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,772
and decided to end things with you.

533
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:50,885
What about Hae Dam?

534
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,317
What are you going to do with her?

535
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:55,836
Do what? She's ahead of herself.

536
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:58,238
You're the only one for me.

537
00:30:58,238 --> 00:31:00,310
Then, take good care of her.

538
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,598
Hae Dam is also my friend.

539
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:05,087
I don't want it to be awkward.

540
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,105
Okay.

541
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,142
You're always so loyal.

542
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,449
Do you trust me now?

543
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:14,919
Well, I guess since I liked you.

544
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,516
Liked me?

545
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,754
Why speak in the past time?
Stay in the now.

546
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:20,766
Good grief.

547
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,300
The candy looks pretty.

548
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,813
Here, you can have one.

549
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:38,944
Hello?

550
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:41,604
Yes, that's me.

551
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:45,317
Really?

552
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,985
Yes, all right.

553
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:49,061
Okay.

554
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,057
What's it about?

555
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,377
I got in.

556
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,378
What? What do you mean?

557
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,170
I sent my demo to that label.

558
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,842
The label with your idols?

559
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:00,457
Yes.

560
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:03,202
I sent a video of me dancing.

561
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:04,782
And now they want to see me.

562
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:07,506
You're good at everything.

563
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:09,467
Of course, I'm your girl.

564
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,164
How cute.

565
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,201
All right, you worked hard today.

566
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,099
Get some rest, and don't be late tomorrow.

567
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,161
Okay.

568
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:22,841
- Rest well.
- Great work today.

569
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,434
- Great work, everybody.
- Great work, everybody.

570
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:27,413
- Good job.
- Great work.

571
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:28,853
Don't drink too much.

572
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:30,002
Turn in early.

573
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,322
Goodnight.

574
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,882
Gi Cheol, you nailed it today.

575
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,499
There is a long way to go.

576
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:38,444
I even fought with our writer.

577
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:42,377
That's because you had Boss
looking out for you.

578
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,340
- Right?
- What?

579
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,663
Of course.

580
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:49,315
He should be here by now.

581
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,301
- Who?
- Mr. Cha is coming.

582
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,428
He's going to introduce the hotel owner.

583
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:54,543
Really?

584
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,341
There he comes.

585
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,924
- Hello.
- Hello.

586
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,833
I saw the news. It went well.

587
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,915
It's thanks to you.

588
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,843
The storm seems to have passed,

589
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:06,370
but we're waiting for internal decisions.

590
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,478
Welcome to my hotel.

591
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:11,609
He is the hotel owner. Say hello.

592
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:13,426
- Hello.
- Hello.

593
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,155
I'm Producer Nam Gi Cheol.

594
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:17,075
This is our Chief Producer Gang.

595
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,371
And this is Producer Kook.

596
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,826
I look forward to the Woori City Drama.

597
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:24,300
It's an honor to have you at my hotel.

598
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,155
The city hall suggested
your establishment.

599
00:33:26,155 --> 00:33:28,237
We'll be staying there during the shoots.

600
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,014
I'm Ko Sang Sik.

601
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:32,166
Please take good care of them.

602
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,507
Your new building looks very nice.

603
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,596
Of course.

604
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,947
Have them stay in nice rooms.

605
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:42,612
Let us know if there is anything amiss.

606
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,460
Thank you.

607
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:47,643
This is like a suite.

608
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,969
Staying here will be comfy.

609
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:55,317
It doesn't have to be this nice.

610
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:57,792
(Descending Life Line)

611
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:58,833
What are you doing?

612
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:03,167
I'm just checking if the safety and fire
equipment are all in place.

613
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,241
Goodness.

614
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:10,888
Please have a good night.

615
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:11,888
Wait.

616
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,260
How many rooms do you have?

617
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,451
About forty.

618
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:17,335
How many exactly are there?

619
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:21,164
Why would you ask that?

620
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:22,894
I'm just curious.

621
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,342
Not counting the auxiliary facilities,

622
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:27,517
there are 46 rooms in total.

623
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:30,128
I see. Thank you.

624
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,155
All right.

625
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,235
What's the matter?

626
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,651
There are more rooms than I thought.

627
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,445
Was this originally the Blue Light Hotel,
not Cheongsong House?

628
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:46,645
How did you know that?

629
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:47,695
From this.

630
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,663
Yes, it was the Blue Light Hotel.

631
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,887
Boss, are you going to stay overnight?

632
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:54,810
No, I'll come back early tomorrow.

633
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:00,653
Let's go together.

634
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,656
Though I would love that,

635
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,896
I have something to check at the office.

636
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:07,159
You're not going home,
but rather doing more work?

637
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,736
Yes. Why?

638
00:35:08,736 --> 00:35:10,216
I've got an appointment.

639
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:12,321
Go ahead. I can go by myself.

640
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,504
Is there a problem here?

641
00:35:16,504 --> 00:35:18,679
After extending the building,

642
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,952
I think they added extra rooms.

643
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:23,214
Isn't that why they got it extended?

644
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,446
Back when it was the Blue Light Hotel,

645
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:27,632
it had around 30 rooms.

646
00:35:27,632 --> 00:35:29,864
Why is having more rooms an issue?

647
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,336
No, it's not an issue.

648
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,942
I'm double-checking just in case.

649
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:35,749
Goodness.

650
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:38,447
Then go ahead. I'll head back.

651
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:39,465
Okay.

652
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,041
Take care.

653
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:48,550
Chief, your eyes are too sweet.

654
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,427
Sweet? What do you mean?

655
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:52,577
Like honey.

656
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:54,920
My fault.

657
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,322
(Cheongsong House Business Permit)

658
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,564

00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:16,081

660
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,955

661
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:23,497
(Blue Light Hotel, 30-room capacity)

662
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,048
Let me get this straight.

663
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,684
So the dentist you're seeing...

664
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:43,678
seems perfect, but isn't your type?

665
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:46,416
That's what it comes down to.

666
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:49,031
What is your type?

667
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,135
Someone who doesn't make me uneasy.

668
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,900
But interest makes you uneasy.

669
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,889
It's not like I want to impress her.

670
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:04,176
I'm constantly trying to suit her taste.

671
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,488
Since it's like that,

672
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:08,802
I feel like I'm losing my true self.

673
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:11,986
I wish to feel easy like I'm with you.

674
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,791
That's because we know each other.

675
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:19,899
You're down-to-earth and carefree.

676
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:23,201
That comes with age.

677
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,939
I used to be more bashful
when I was younger.

678
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:28,668
You were so pretty back then.

679
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:32,536
That past tense really stings.

680
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:34,638
You're still pretty.

681
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,896
Isn't there someone like you?

682
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:42,416
I'm right here, aren't I?

683
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:48,249
- Su Hyeok.
- Yes?

684
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,084
From now on,

685
00:37:52,513 --> 00:37:53,859
let's not see each other.

686
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:56,826
Why?

687
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:59,858
You focus on your love life,
and I'll do the same.

688
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:04,087
I don't usually younger date guys,

689
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:05,952
but my student has been an exception.

690
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,451
Shall we get going?

691
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,096
Ms. Koo.

692
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,736
Did I do something wrong?

693
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,986
- No.
- Then why?

694
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:33,224
I don't like giving you love advice...

695
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:36,693
and how I was your first love
who had the looks.

696
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:38,312
It is like being compared to the past.

697
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:42,523
Anyway, I'm much older than you.

698
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,825
Sorry about all this.

699
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,624
It sounds like you're into me.

700
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,072
I don't like younger guys.

701
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:03,173
What are you doing?

702
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:06,278
I'm preparing food for the chefs' party.

703
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:08,168
Will it be held tomorrow already?

704
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:09,168
Yes.

705
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:13,622
I'm not really feeling up for it
after Sang Sik's thing.

706
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:15,955
Do you want to skip it?

707
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:18,042
But you said friends were coming.

708
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,673
Then you can't be there alone.

709
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:22,114
Well, you're right.

710
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:25,226
I'll go unless someone else can.

711
00:39:25,226 --> 00:39:26,260
That sounds good.

712
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:28,787
What? You don't care either way?

713
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,249
Is that your only response?

714
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:31,884
Just do whatever you like.

715
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:34,744
But what am I supposed to wear?

716
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,454
Don't be stressed about that.

717
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:39,271
It's a party, but I've got no outfit.

718
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:44,924
Seriously, you're such a tomboy.

719
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,276
Would you like me to buy you one?

720
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,748
No, I'm not your girlfriend.

721
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:52,261
One minute you claim to be that,
but now you don't?

722
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:54,459
Do you think I'm that easy?

723
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,918
You said I should do whatever I like.

724
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:57,622
Goodness.

725
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,836
Then are you coming tomorrow?

726
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,031
I'll think about it.

727
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:17,739
Good heavens.

728
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,221
Why are you outside?

729
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,380
Well, since you hadn't come back,

730
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,085
I thought I'd take a walk and wait.

731
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,101
My word, this feels nice.

732
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,453
It's good to have someone waiting.

733
00:40:28,453 --> 00:40:30,844
I'll have to come home early now.

734
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:37,007
What about the objection you raised?

735
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:38,696
When will the result come out?

736
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,513
Give it a little time.

737
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:41,827
Were you concerned about that?

738
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,410
It feels like it's because of me.

739
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,207
When you care about someone,

740
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:51,128
the universe becomes jealous
and makes things difficult.

741
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:52,983
This is a bit too much.

742
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,787
There will be more troubles ahead
that could shake us.

743
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,858
Some may catch us by surprise.

744
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,257
There could be misunderstandings...

745
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,884
and even moments of disappointment.

746
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,761
Let's talk it out every time.

747
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,439
Don't try to bear it alone,

748
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:12,908
but think of ways and resolve it together.

749
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,057
Of course.

750
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,052
Producer Gang is a troubleshooter.

751
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:22,341
And you always head off issues
before they arise.

752
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,471
You're here.

753
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,822
My word, who's this?

754
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:58,834
What? Do I look weird?

755
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:02,023
No, you look pretty.

756
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,229
Really?

757
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:06,588
Yes.

758
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:10,320
Wait here. I'll get changed.

759
00:42:10,756 --> 00:42:11,758
Okay.

760
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,404
Today is the day.

761
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,704
Ko Mi Rye, let's do this.

762
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:26,531
You look nice today.

763
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:28,677
Of course. I'm going with you.

764
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:32,245
(Producer Nam Gi Cheol)

765
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,728
Why aren't you taking the call?

766
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:38,979
I will.

767
00:42:41,905 --> 00:42:43,194
Yes, Producer Nam.

768
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,738
I have something important today.

769
00:42:49,497 --> 00:42:50,674
What?

770
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,484
No, it's not a date.

771
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:57,308
Sorry, I'll call you later. Okay.

772
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,009
Maybe he called about work.

773
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:03,610
Are you sure you don't need to go?

774
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,041
No, he had an argument with Ms. Na.

775
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,565
The shoots are busy, anyway.

776
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,350
He must really like you.

777
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,230
It's not like that.

778
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,815
Another love triangle?

779
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:17,611
This is so exhausting.

780
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,810
What?

781
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,796
I'm just kidding.

782
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,865
Sang Sik.

783
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:31,402
I'm taking Mi Rye to the chefs' party.

784
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:34,290
Really? You should come together.

785
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:38,494
Okay, I'll send you the address.

786
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:39,520
All right.

787
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:43,700
Is he bringing Producer Gang?

788
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,270
Yes, isn't that great?

789
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,701
I thought it would just be us.

790
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:52,438
But it's a nice day.

791
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,368
(Woori City Tour)

792
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:57,335
- Deputy Mayor, hello.
- Hello.

793
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,681
You can get on.

794
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:03,640
Dokgo Bong, over here.

795
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:15,166
I spotted you from way over there.

796
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,025
Why are you so stunning today?

797
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:21,526
- Here.
- What is this?

798
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,952
Chief Ko and his Regional Tourism Team...

799
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,179
developed a city tour.

800
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:27,385
A “city tour?”

801
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:29,841
Are we hopping on a bus together...

802
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,961
and driving around the city?

803
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,736
We need to check the route...

804
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:37,049
and figure out effective ways to run it.

805
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,009
Then go with your employees, not me.

806
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,368
Young people will ride together...

807
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:44,576
and see it from a couple's perspective.

808
00:44:44,576 --> 00:44:49,353
Then, are we representing senior couples?

809
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,456
We're still young at heart, but yes.

810
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:55,433
Did you call me because you got bored?

811
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:57,009
No.

812
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:59,864
To make our community clean and just,

813
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,353
I'm committed to giving my everything.

814
00:45:02,353 --> 00:45:04,536
Why?

815
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:08,224
Why dedicate all your beauty
to the community?

816
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:09,368
Over my dead body.

817
00:45:09,368 --> 00:45:11,504
For crying out loud.

818
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:13,133
People might hear you.

819
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:17,810
Your finger doesn't have our ring.

820
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,275
Where on earth is it?

821
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:21,418
You're supposed to wear it with me.

822
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,613
Why are you trying to pose as single?

823
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,610
It's right here.

824
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,291
Wearing it is awkward since
I'm not used to it.

825
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,955
Then it's not a promise ring.

826
00:45:32,955 --> 00:45:35,251
Give it to me. I'll find someone who will.

827
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:36,452
Good grief.

828
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:46,264
My goodness. Hello.

829
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:47,911
What brings you here?

830
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Who do we have here?

831
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,102
You're that young and pretty lady.

832
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,997
This is great work you're doing.

833
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:58,540
Are you here alone?

834
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,573
I'm not a lonely man, unlike my name.

835
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:03,646
So what?

836
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,982
She's over there.

837
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:10,845
Are you here with the Deputy Mayor?

838
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:13,218
We're dating these days.

839
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:15,259
Seriously, I'm jealous.

840
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,609
Aren't you coming?

841
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,111
All right.

842
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,338
See you later.

845
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:38,356
Park Jun Woo.

846
00:46:39,419 --> 00:46:41,043
Hello. Are you doing well?

847
00:46:41,043 --> 00:46:43,083
Yes, it's good to see you.

848
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,324
Me too.

849
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:46,100
Is she your cooking buddy?

850
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,428
Hello, I've seen you on TV.

851
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:50,293
I want to get his autograph.

852
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:52,876
She's my best friend who creates webtoons.

853
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,708
These days, she is writing drama scripts.

854
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:58,116
I should get your autograph instead.

855
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,310
No, you're too kind.

856
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:01,484
What are you cooking today?

857
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,147
Well, it's a vegan dessert.

858
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:05,907
Not sure if this wedding cake
will turn out well.

859
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,555
Wedding cake? You didn't tell me that.

860
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:10,907
Don't work too hard.

861
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:13,509
I'm a bit competitive.

862
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,955
I'm looking forward to today.

863
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:17,086
I'll see you.

(Reminiscent Alleys and Villages)

865
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:39,446
Woori City has recreated a village here,

866
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:41,903
and you can revisit the old memories.

867
00:47:41,903 --> 00:47:44,942
Take lots of pictures
and make fresh new memories.

868
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:46,194
Okay.

869
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,336
Coming here feels like...

870
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:52,985
we took a time machine back to the past.

871
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:55,981
I know. Life back then was hard,

872
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:57,069
but there was so much love.

873
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:58,076
Tell me about it.

874
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:02,373
Wait, let's snap a picture here.

875
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:04,312
- Don't move.
- What's this?

876
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:06,417
It's a selfie stick.

877
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,075
When did you even get it?

878
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:11,651
Good heavens.

879
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:20,531
We used to send telegrams.

880
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,379
My word. What are you doing?

881
00:48:30,379 --> 00:48:31,586
There isn't anyone around.

882
00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:33,445
You never miss a chance.

883
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:35,381
Catch me if you can.

884

885
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,437
Only three minutes remaining. Let's hurry.

886
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:43,437
Wait.

887
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:46,906
- What now?
- Too bad!

888
00:48:46,906 --> 00:48:50,943
Let's scrape the top for something else.

889
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,904
We won't have enough milk.

890
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:56,089
But there isn't anything suitable.

891
00:48:56,471 --> 00:48:59,724
How about coconut milk? I brought some.

892
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:00,724
Okay.

893
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:03,739
How did it even cross your mind?

894
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,910
What you say tends to stick with me.

895
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,196
My word, he's finished already.

896
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:15,973
Don't worry. Take your time.

897
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,082
Okay.

898
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:41,629
Good job.

899
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,948
Taste doesn't always have to
be about presentation.

900
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,059
Especially at today's event,

901
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:52,987
it's more about how you feel
cooking without another.

902
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:56,379
Isn't that more important?

903
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:04,565
Now, here are the judges' results.

904
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:08,136
So don’t be disheartened hearing the news,
so relax.

905
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:09,160
Okay.

906

At the 17th top chefs' banquet,

907
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:16,506
today's winner is...

908
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:18,521
Park Jun Woo!

909
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:19,767
Congratulations.

910
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:28,870
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

911
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,011
Thank you.

912
00:50:32,918 --> 00:50:35,614
These two must work in great sync.

913
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:38,263
Of course, they've been tight
since they were six.

914
00:50:38,263 --> 00:50:39,552
Six years old?

915
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:42,232
Should we stop staring at it and eat?

916
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:45,086
It looks too pretty to have
after all that work.

917
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:46,947
We made it to share anyway.

918
00:50:47,771 --> 00:50:49,282
Then I'll cut it.

919
00:50:49,282 --> 00:50:50,810
Wait.

920
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,626
How about you cut it as a couple?

921
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:55,484
- What?
- Yes, go ahead.

922
00:50:55,484 --> 00:50:56,795
What are you doing?

923
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:57,948
Sang Sik.

924
00:50:57,948 --> 00:50:59,137
Okay.

925
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:00,483
Why don't you join me?

926
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,389
Goodness.

927
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:04,866
Wait a minute.

928
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:06,451
For a photo.

929
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:08,307
It seems to be your wedding.

930
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:10,636
- My goodness.
- One, two, three.

931
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,052
You look like a married couple.

932
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:15,842
- Let's cut it now.
- Okay.

933
00:51:15,842 --> 00:51:16,842
All right.

934
00:51:21,706 --> 00:51:23,372
You worked hard.

935
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,565
Don't mention it.

936
00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:27,114
I was really moved today.

937
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:29,141
- You were moved?
- Yes.

938
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:31,222
When I saw the finished cake,

939
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:33,496
I wanted to marry for the first time.

940
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:35,616
Really?

941
00:51:35,616 --> 00:51:37,282
What's holding you back?

942
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:40,448
With whom?

943
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:43,080
Who do you think?

944
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,585
It'd be with your future husband.

945
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:48,818
Are you trying to be funny?

946
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,492
That was even worse than dad jokes.

947
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:55,150
Maybe that's why I'm still single.

948
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,508
I don't mean it like that.

949
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,236
Your girl is out there.

950
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:08,505
You see,

951
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:12,560
I have something to say.

952
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,593
Jun Woo, I...

953
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,113
Don't make your confession.

954
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,214
Even if you liked me first,

955
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:39,169
I want to be the one to say it.

956
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:45,152
So wait for me.

957
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,088
That's what a guy should be asking.

958
00:52:57,495 --> 00:52:59,230
Wait, that's alcohol.

959
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:06,701
What?

960
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:10,112
Did you enjoy the food?

961
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:12,708
Yes, and it was quite a spectacle.

962
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,648
Thanks for getting along with the family.

963
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,254
Why would you thank me? It's a given.

964
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:25,526
Then can you be a part of my family?

965
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:31,066
What do you mean?

966
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:34,827
Are you asking me to marry you?

967
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,723
Maybe it's because of the wedding cake.

968
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:42,649
Then, let's just forget about it.

969
00:53:42,649 --> 00:53:43,649
You see...

970
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:48,460
It has crossed my mind a lot.

971
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,203
I'd be lying if I say it never did.

972
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:54,364
Haven't you thought about it?

973
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,809
I don't know.

974
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:01,276
Marriage is strange and daunting.

975
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:04,329
What I have known all my life...

976
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:06,339
would be dramatically changed.

977
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:10,211
And love doesn't always lead to marriage.

978
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:17,157
Then promise you won't eat alone.

979
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,582
We can start with sharing meals.

980
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:27,154
You can come to dine with my family,

981
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:29,700
or I could eat at your place.

982
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,044
Let's always have breakfast together.

983
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:33,044
What do you think?

984
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:39,056
We can give that a shot.

985
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:44,011
But I get to choose what comes next.

986
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:45,011
Sounds good.

987
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,524
I'm ready to move in together,

988
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:50,153
but I'll wait for you.

989
00:55:01,421 --> 00:55:03,294
What are you trying to say?

990
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:04,871
I mean, don't misunderstand me.

991
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:07,278
Honestly, I do like the lady next door.

992
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:11,351
But you need to be cautious.

993
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:14,433
What if something happens to you?

994
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:15,630
Happen to me?

995
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,815
Yes.

996
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:18,661
Given the problems you faced at work,

997
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:21,245
she wasn't entirely uninvolved.

998
00:55:21,245 --> 00:55:25,317
When things get tough,
she helps out and is there for me.

999
00:55:25,317 --> 00:55:28,558
It won't be a problem for you,
so don't worry.

1000
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,535
Yes, but even so...

1001
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:35,156
Goodness.

1002
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:37,565
What about your husband?

1003
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,814
Why are you bringing him up now?

1004
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:41,162
Since we've been living apart,

1005
00:55:41,162 --> 00:55:43,891
he seems to be enjoying his freedom.

1006
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:45,341
Are you going to let it continue?

1007
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,749
He'll get what's coming to him.

1008
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:49,894
I'll have an affair and then divorce him.

1009
00:55:50,356 --> 00:55:51,356
What?

1010
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:58,475
Son, it's your mom.

1011
00:55:58,475 --> 00:55:59,996
Have you eaten?

1012
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,013
I'm back.

1013
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,556
Hello.

1014
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:06,187
Is the new study cafe all right for you?

1015
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:07,190
Of course.

1016
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:15,279
- Dad?
- Yes?

1017
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:17,993
Why should I learn about
your love life online?

1018
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:20,571
Well.

1019
00:56:21,747 --> 00:56:22,747
I'm sorry.

1020
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,039
Why don't you let me in on the situation?

1021
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,417
I didn't want to distract your studies.

1022
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:30,073
Did she tell you about it?

1023
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:31,651
That if you want to move in together,

1024
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:34,132
how she shouldn't mind me?

1025
00:56:35,553 --> 00:56:36,978
No.

1026
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:39,385
Then why haven't you asked me?

1027
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:41,187
Don't you care what I think?

1028
00:56:41,705 --> 00:56:43,705
Why would you say that?

1029
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:46,993
I have only one thing to tell you.

1030
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:49,771
Don't feel bad about wanting to marry.

1031
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,289
Feel bad?

1032
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:53,208
Thinking that I need a mother figure,

1033
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,394
don't rush into it unwillingly.

1034
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:59,061
And don't let being a single dad
weigh you down.

1035
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:01,181
Okay.

1036
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,821
And I'm good without a mom,

1037
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,528
so leave me out of your relationship.

1038
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:23,999
Don't make your confession.

1039
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:26,681
Even if you liked me first,

1040
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,215
I want to be the one to say it.

1041
00:57:44,742 --> 00:57:47,987
Whoever made it did a good job.

1042
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:01,305
You look great together.

1043
00:58:12,024 --> 00:58:13,024
Marriage?

1044
00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:17,553
Marriage.

1045
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,761
My goodness, you're up early.

1046
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:56,665
I couldn't sleep a wink, thanks to you.

1047
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,418
Why not?

1048
00:58:59,392 --> 00:59:01,250
We agreed to have breakfast together.

1049
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,716
I even waited to come over,
but you were still asleep.

1050
00:59:04,194 --> 00:59:06,291
You promised to be my family.

1051
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,291
Right.

1052
00:59:08,123 --> 00:59:10,204
But I'm so tired.

1053
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,612
Make me something good.

1054
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:17,875
I did learn to make this from Jun Woo.

1055
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:20,532
Don't complain, even if it tastes bad.

1056
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:32,343
You're actually good at cooking.

1057
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:34,144
Of course. I've raised Ye Ji.

1058
00:59:34,144 --> 00:59:35,873
Who would cook without Jun Woo?

1059
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:38,232
So I'm a part of your family now?

1060
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:40,906
Exactly. No objections from anyone.

1061
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:46,131
But your sister Sang Hee...

1062
00:59:46,847 --> 00:59:48,206
What about her?

1063
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:51,032
I'm getting that she doesn't like me.

1064
00:59:51,032 --> 00:59:53,913
No way. It's because of her husband.

1065
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:56,505
I hope they patch things up soon.

1066
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:57,505
Tell me about it.

1067
00:59:58,354 --> 00:59:59,716
Wait a minute.

1068
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:02,159
Open your mouth.

1069
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,069
What do you think?

1070
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,913
So tasty.

1071
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,537
My word, it's delicious.

1072
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:16,369
I make this better than Jun Woo does.

1073
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:19,862
What about Dad?

1074
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:22,031
He took some food next door.

1075
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:25,625
Are they going to eat there now?

1076
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,442
She'll come over sometimes.

1077
01:00:27,442 --> 01:00:29,730
Really? It kind of feels empty.

1078
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,074
Should I invite them here?

1079
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:32,502
No, it's fine.

1080
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:36,132
His demotion hasn't even been settled.

1081
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,762
Should they be acting like this?

1082
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:39,265
Demoted?

1083
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:40,314
- Sang Hee.
- Sang Hee.

1084
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:43,656
It's nothing, Ye Ji.

1085
01:00:43,656 --> 01:00:45,822
You should have this.

1086
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:48,848
I wonder if Hun had breakfast.

1087
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:51,369
That darn husband.

1088
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:54,984
What? Chief Ko Sang Sik?

1089
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,984
Yes.

1090
01:00:57,263 --> 01:00:58,263
Here.

1091
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,089
He carefully inspected the suite...

1092
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:03,503
and asked about our total room capacity.

1093
01:01:03,503 --> 01:01:05,056
I'm getting nervous.

1094
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:07,928
We wanted the drama to give us
a promotional effect.

1095
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:10,199
But what if it backfires to make trouble?

1096
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:12,645
Don't worry.

1097
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:15,855
After your hefty investment in renovation,

1098
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:17,304
you'll get your money back.

1099
01:01:18,284 --> 01:01:21,783
I've always delivered results for you.

1100
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:26,950
But why is there so much fuss
over the ferry issue?

1101
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,404
Wasn't it supposed to be over?

1102
01:01:28,404 --> 01:01:30,571
It will die down shortly.

1103
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:33,510
They won't find out anything, so relax.

1104
01:01:40,973 --> 01:01:41,973
Who's calling?

1105
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,761
Jae Yeong's mom, what's up?

1106
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:52,349
Of course, I've applied to send
my son to study in China.

1107
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,738
What are you talking about?

1108
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:57,563
What did my brother endorse?

1109
01:02:08,453 --> 01:02:10,042
(Language Program in China)

1110
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,937
What?

1111
01:02:25,937 --> 01:02:28,626
Why hasn't anyone come to work?

1112
01:02:30,856 --> 01:02:33,051
(China Top Overseas Program)

1113
01:02:43,481 --> 01:02:46,553
Woori City's language program overseas...

1114
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:50,391
developed and backed by Chief Ko?

1115
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:52,415
What?

1116
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:56,044
Why isn't he here yet?

1117
01:02:56,044 --> 01:02:57,562
There he comes.

1118
01:02:57,562 --> 01:02:59,135
Chief Ko.

1119
01:02:59,812 --> 01:03:01,621
What's the deal here?

1120
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:04,596
We trusted in Woori City's endorsement...

1121
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:06,492
and paid the tuition fees to the schools,

1122
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,637
but our kids aren't even on their list.

1123
01:03:09,637 --> 01:03:12,580
We came after checking early,

1124
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,646
but they were still distributing flyers
at the subway station.

1125
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:18,085
Where is this agency?

1126
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,197
It's behind Cheongrim Station,
but this morning,

1127
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,684
their doors were locked,
and they weren't answering calls.

1128
01:03:22,684 --> 01:03:24,730
- That's right.
- Isn't this a scam?

1129
01:03:25,254 --> 01:03:27,499
This really must be a scam.

1130
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,880
Yes?

1131
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,092
I got a flyer at Cheongrim Station.

1132
01:03:33,092 --> 01:03:35,196
It even features your photo...

1133
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:39,332
and claims that you developed
this study program.

1134
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:40,421
Is that true?

1135
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:43,510
Chief Ko should sort this out.

1136
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,646
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1137
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:50,885
Hello?

1138
01:03:51,618 --> 01:03:53,012
What's that noise?

1139
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,967
