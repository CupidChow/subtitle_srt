1
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:05,287
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,259
Ko Sang Sik.

3
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:58,551
Do you...

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,566
have feelings for me?

5
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:22,254
What do you mean by that?

6
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:26,758
Do you have feelings for me?

7
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:30,073
Why would you ask such a strange question?

8
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,277
Is it a strange question?

9
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:35,398
Whether I like someone or not,

10
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:38,022
why would it matter in my life?

11
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,811
It won't change anything.

12
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,060
Why is that?

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,959
Even if I do like someone,

14
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,624
it won't make any difference in my life.

15
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:52,054
So what's the point of having feelings,

16
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:55,893
and what's the point if I don't?

17
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:57,425
It's all meaningless.

18
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,728
I get what you're saying.

19
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,809
Sure, I've had similar thoughts.

20
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,827
"Why bother at my age?"

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,969
But you can't tell if it matters or not...

22
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,209
unless you give it a try.

23
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,888
Life may not change drastically,

24
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:23,202
but how you feel could be different.

25
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,353
What's wrong with having feelings?

26
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:28,074
If you declare life to be emotionless,

27
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,749
wouldn't it be depressing...

28
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:32,247
and even sad?

29
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:40,039
Well, I've grown used to this life.

30
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:45,255
I, for one, won't live that way anymore.

31
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:50,971
Like the dramas I've made,

32
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,266
I want to love with all my heart...

33
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,760
and wait excitedly for someone.

34
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:07,719
I want to hold hands, I want to feel
a rush, and even become jealous.

35
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,303
I want to live like that.

36
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,247
Well, that's...

37
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:19,070
That's possible for you being single,
but for me...

38
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,206
Why even ask me this suddenly?

39
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,091
I mean, look how you got injured.

40
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,661
You threw yourself to save me
from a charging horse.

41
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,397
Was that also a part of community service?

42
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,827
Helping someone who is in danger...

43
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,533
is basic human instinct.

44
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,286
Are you telling me...

45
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:45,839
you don't have any feelings for me?

46
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,405
When there is a woman in trouble,

47
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,614
it's expected for a man to help.

48
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:57,293
And it's just a neighborly thing to do...

49
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:00,448
to help each other like that.

50
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,254
Fair enough.

51
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,985
I thought you had feelings for me...

52
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:10,466
and didn't know what to make of it.

53
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,856
Good heavens, you worry too much.

54
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:18,109
I just didn't want any spark
to make it awkward.

55
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,916
Isn't it strange to suspect
a spark from that?

56
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,450
Perhaps you're the one who
has feelings for me.

57
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,736
There is no way!

58
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,210
Good grief.

59
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,412
You're so straightforward.

60
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:37,060
I don't like things to be awkward,
so let's be friends.

61
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,460
- Friends?
- Why not?

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,180
Are you like an old geezer...

63
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,397
who think men can't even befriend women?

64
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,502
I'm not that old school.

65
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,694
Then it's settled.

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Okay, then.

67
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,246
Let's be friends.

68
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:02,207
My word, seriously.

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,288
(Second to Last Love)

70
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,351
(Episode 8)

71
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,082
Friends?

72
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:24,829
Become friends?

73
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:25,928
Good grief.

74
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,095
("Life is Beautiful")

75
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,759
Wait a minute.

76
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,572
He's bald.

77
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:52,461
I didn't know you drink so well.

78
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,560
Cheers.

79
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:44,934
What am I going to do?

80
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,541
She doesn't even remember that.

81
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,846
I'm in trouble.

82
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,003
- Haven't they grown?
- Yes.

83
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,705
I saw Honey being born with Jun Woo,

84
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,434
and she has her own foal now.

85
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:07,468
Time really flies.

86
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,953
My little ones here...

87
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:12,225
have grown up healthy, thanks to Chief Ko.

88
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:15,709
There is no one like him who
has cared so much.

89
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,878
I'm also growing up in his good care.

90
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,197
Are you still friends with Jun Woo?

91
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:23,217
Of course.

92
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,604
You were playmates as kids,

93
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,733
but now you're adults.

94
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,188
Isn't there any spark between you?

95
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,754
No, you know how it's with us.

96
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,468
Who knows what might happen?

97
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,333
Well, Jun Woo is here.

98
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,199
You there, Ko Mi Rye!

99
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,820
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

100
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,908
I made you something. Give it a taste.

101
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:55,438
You shouldn't every time.

102
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:56,740
Take her home.

103
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,686
I like having her here,
but Chief Ko would worry.

104
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,496
Okay, I'll whisk her away.

105
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,392
Why did you come? I said not to.

106
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,375
Hello, Honey.

107
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,480
My word, she has grown a lot.

108
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,793
You should have brought some booze.

109
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,367
Do you want some? I could buy some now.

110
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:16,555
No, it's okay.

111
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:22,018
What on Earth happened at the network?

112
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,998
Your brother finally let you work there.

113
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:27,529
Are you really not going back?

114
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:33,268
I couldn't bail after hearing
what Min Ju said.

115
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:34,713
What did she tell you?

116
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:40,630
There were painful times in her past.

117
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,002
Painful times? In Min Ju's past?

118
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,737
Just leave it there.

119
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,284
Who doesn't have a past? Even you do.

120
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:52,032
All right, I'm done eating.

121
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,988
What? You barely had anything.

122
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:58,755
What are you doing? Let's go home.

123
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,281
My word, that smells.

124
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,121
What do you expect from a stable?

125
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:06,757
Do you like this place over a hotel?

126
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,457
Who has the money for hotels?

127
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:11,217
I like this place. It's comforting.

128
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,154
You're like a maiden of the stable.

129
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,827
How do you know I'm a maiden?

130
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:18,211
You always get the last word.

131
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,980
Just go. I need to sleep. I'm tired.

132
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,064
My goodness, seriously.

133
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,365
Why are you lying down?

134
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,773
I just want to rest a bit.

135
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,929
Do you think this is a hotel or something?

136
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:34,957
I guess you're all grown up.

137
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,358
As kids, you told me everything here.

138
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,828
Leave me alone.

139
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:42,552
I won't get anything out today.

140
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,525
Don't stress out too much.

141
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:51,160
And be back in the morning, okay?

142
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,519
Did you get that?

143
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,319
Okay.

144
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:01,636
I wanted to congratulate you on
your new scripting job.

145
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:06,261
Seeing you doing what you love...

146
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:07,772
made me happy.

147
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,318
I wanted to tell you that.

148
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,444
What are you cooking?

149
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,038
It smells so good.

150
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:28,748
I'm making abalone porridge for Min Ju.

151
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:30,317
What a lucky neighbor.

152
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,965
She gets to taste Jun Woo's treat.

153
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,076
It's no big deal.

154
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:36,341
I've made plenty, so have some for dinner.

155
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,734
Okay, it must be tough alone
at the hospital, so hurry.

156
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:39,784
Okay.

157
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,560
Aunt Mi Rye didn't come home last night.

158
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,386
- I know.
- Why?

159
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:46,479
Didn't she start working with that lady?

160
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,768
Is she working nights already?

161
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,153
Ask Mi Rye yourself when she gets back.

162
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:55,120
Sweetie, drop off Hun before work.

163
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,847
Why did you skip breakfast
and feel so down?

164
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:58,871
Hand me my bag.

165
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,327
This? Here you go.

166
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,615
Here you go.

167
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:03,534
- I'll get going.
- I'm off.

168
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,387
- Me, too.
- I'll see you later.

169
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:07,046
Have a good one!

170
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,303
- Thank you.
- Take care.

171
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:17,838
Min Ju.

172
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,819
My word. What brings you here?

173
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:23,852
You should rest more.
Do you have to leave today?

174
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,600
I even brought you porridge.

175
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,358
Why did you visit Mi Rye yesterday?

176
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,961
You shouldn't strain yourself.

177
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,951
I'm better now.

178
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:34,961
Let's go.

179
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,024
We can take it easy with plenty of time.

180
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,671
I should get to the office quickly.

181
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,327
Like this?

182
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,163
Not today. I won't let you go.

183
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:55,059
What man stood by my side
when I wasn't well?

184
00:11:58,741 --> 00:11:59,779
Eun Ho.

185
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,422
Jun Woo brings back memories of him.

186
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,457
And the feelings rush back.

187
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,112
What's wrong?

188
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,386
Are you feeling unwell?

189
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,099
It's nothing.

190
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,071
(Woori City Hall)

191
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:57,368
The Regional Tourism Team can handle
the promotion of our city...

192
00:12:57,368 --> 00:12:59,640
and focus on developing tourist spots.

193
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,544
As for the city drama project,

194
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:05,388
Director Shin Seok Gi can supervise
all the preparations.

195
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,968
That's it for today.

196
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,537
- Good work.
- Thanks for everything.

197
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:14,993
Chief Ko, take a look here.

198
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:19,111
Thanks to the grape festival,

199
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:21,951
the Corporate Support Team got a bonus.

200
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,703
But your team worked hard on the site,

201
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,981
so take some for a team dinner.

202
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,686
Team dinner? There's no need.

203
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:32,278
I know you guys worked hard
in the rain that day.

204
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,270
- Just take it.
- Instead of our local grapes,

205
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,674
someone sold cheap imported ones...

206
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,619
with an inside mole.

207
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,326
Have you looked into that?

208
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,850
Chief Ko, what are you talking about?

209
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,672
If you're too busy,
I can report the police myself.

210
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:50,893
Go ahead.

211
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,381
Make sure you do that.

212
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,486
So you won't take this bonus?

213
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:58,753
I wouldn't want to be in the same boat.

214
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:01,286
What did you say?

215
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,483
That's a groundless accusation.

216
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,949
Chief Ko.

217
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:12,949
What?

218
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:15,776
At the grape festival,

219
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:18,311
the person who swapped the grapes...

220
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,932
You don't need to worry about it.

221
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,408
Are you sure it's okay to push it?

222
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,568
I mean, given your age,

223
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:28,034
it would make your chances
slimmer for a promotion.

224
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,585
Middle age has its fair share of failures.

225
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,161
I'm okay with growing old this way.

226
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:40,097
But why is Director Shin eager
to bring you down?

227
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,264
Today is the real deal.

228
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:45,640
Good heavens,
I'm nervous to face the crowd.

229
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,993
I'm ready. It's going to be fun.

230
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,216
Here is yours.

231
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,688
- Okay.
- Let's crush this.

232
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,241
Shall we get to it?

233
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,394
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,211
(Happiness Concert at Woori City of Music)

235
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,157
- Welcome.
- Please take a seat.

236
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:14,617
What's going on here?

237
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:18,922
As you can see, this year's summer
promotion of the city...

238
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:23,239
will be staged with my team's
string quartet concert.

239
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,520
So you guys can head back.

240
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,037
But we put so much work into this.

241
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:31,040
Ms. Han, did you make this song?

242
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,231
Yes, sir.

243
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,694
That's why you're a contract worker...

244
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:38,449
and won't ever land a regular job.

245
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,751
If you don't want to be sacked
before your contract ends,

246
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,070
don't waste your time like this,

247
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,446
and make something more creative
that actually works.

248
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,953
The remarks you made...

249
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:49,223
fall under defamation that
insults her character.

250
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,719
So break it up and get back inside.

251
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,922
That's an order!

252
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,961
No, Chief Ko.

253
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,973
How could you even think of
working in this state?

254
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,444
You should also head back.

255
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,071
It's not good to disappoint
your customers.

256
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,583
I have a part-timer there.

257
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,987
You do? That's good.

258
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:16,438
I'm not sure if it's good or bad.

259
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,580
What's that supposed to mean?

260
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,286
There is a bit of a situation.

261
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,043
I'll tell you about it later.

262
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:23,218
Didn't Mi Rye say anything?

263
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,419
Don't worry about her.

264
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,038
She'll probably return to work.

265
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,521
How can you be so sure?

266
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,292
We grew up together, so it's obvious.

267
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,898
I see.

268
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:37,282
You must be pretty close.

269
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:40,450
Yes, but don't get me wrong.

270
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,270
We're just friends.

271
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,105
Friends?

272
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:49,347
Is friendship possible
between men and women?

273
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:50,460
Of course.

274
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,902
Yes, I agree with that.

275
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,142
Enjoy what I made you at home.

276
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,762
And don't work too hard.

277
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,243
Yes, okay.

278
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,833
Ms. Han.

279
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,337
You know, even as a contract worker,

280
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:45,269
I took pride in my work and did my best.

281
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:47,763
I know.

282
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:53,567
What do you know? You know nothing.

283
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,529
Since you first came to work,

284
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:59,192
I know you stayed behind at the office...

285
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,523
and did your work overnight.

286
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,225
You always came in early...

287
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,733
and secretly wiped everyone's desk.

288
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:11,561
We never ran out of supplies
since you kept track.

289
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,689
And at the grape festival,

290
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,991
you selected the best grapes
more thoroughly than me.

291
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,337
Chief Ko.

292
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,835
I know all that.

293
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,919
So don't let that man upset you.

294
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,469
You know what?

295
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,487
You have hurt me, too.

296
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,096
Me?

297
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,700
At the grape festival,

298
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,486
I saw you with Gang Min Ju.

299
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:45,778
You took off in the rain together.

300
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,436
What?

301
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:50,882
Let's run!

302
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,934
That was because it was pouring.

303
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:03,432
Why should I explain that to you?

304
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:06,559
So you two aren't what I think.

305
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,594
Right?

306
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,591
No, we're not like that.

307
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:10,609
Then what?

308
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,542
Well, I guess...

309
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,479
We're friends and neighbors.

310
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:19,478
Friends?

311
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,250
Yes.

312
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,278
Chief Ko.

313
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,415
I didn't know that.

314
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,633
Wait, Ms. Han.

315
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,452
Ms. Han.

316
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:35,272
- Someone saw us.
- Chief Ko.

317
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,212
Ms. Han, you can't be like this.

318
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,627
Ms. Han, wait a minute.

319
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,130
Boss.

320
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,793
Boss.

321
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:53,961
Ko Mi Rye?

322
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:06,058
You're determined despite the crutch.

323
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,753
Why don't you rest first?

324
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,794
Where is the time?
Let's hurry back after eating.

325
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,860
After reading Ms. Na's proposal,

326
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,657
I reworked the concept this way.

327
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:15,920
Wait a minute.

328
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,889
Please explain beforehand...

329
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,738
why I should work with Ko Mi Rye.

330
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:28,438
At first, she appears unpolished
and even lacking.

331
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,639
But she sees people in a way...

332
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:34,308
that's heartfelt and beautiful.

333
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,844
And it makes you want it.

334
00:20:35,844 --> 00:20:37,460
Then what exactly does she have...

335
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,615
that I don't have myself?

336
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:41,964
Well.

337
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,285
So, you mean being dirty?

338
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,268
No.

339
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:55,299
She gets curious when other people
don't take interest.

340
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,430
She has a keen observation.

341
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:01,430
You're pretty cute up close.

342
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,558
How old are you?

343
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm 35.

344
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,849
You look so young.

345
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,258
Then I'm older than you.

346
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,816
Stop lying. You're the same age.

347
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:12,079
My word.

348
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,952
There is no age difference
in the workplace.

349
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:17,034
Ms. Ko, just call him Producer Nam.

350
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:19,694
I'm not even an official writer yet.

351
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,217
All right, Producer Nam.

352
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:23,940
Let's start our lunch meeting.

353
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,789
This here...

354
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:37,529
Hello?

355
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:43,025
Mi Rye is back at work?

356
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,352
No, I'm glad.

357
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,294
Okay.

358
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,039
It's been a while. Good to see you.

359
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,725
What brings you here?

360
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:02,869
Why? I'm here for the city drama.

361
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:06,137
You should've kept in touch
if you worked here.

362
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,926
So the all-time star, Na Joo Yeon,

363
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:16,301
signed with Producer Han's project?

364
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,878
- Yes.
- The man is shameless.

365
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:22,018
You were his assistant producer before,

366
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,952
but now he wants to outdo you.

367
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:27,857
Then are we out if he gets picked?

368
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:28,935
Bingo.

369
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,032
Who is Producer Han?

370
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,186
It's that man.

371
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,979
Min Ju, I heard that you got hurt.
Are you okay?

372
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,528
Why get back without a break?

373
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:39,550
Let's go work.

374
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,043
- Okay.
- Okay.

375
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:50,156
Ms. Ko.

376
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:53,010
I heard you packed up and left.

377
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,989
Did something bother you?

378
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:58,165
Of course not.

379
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,361
You're not a coward like someone I know.

380
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,172
I hope you work hard.

381
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,286
"Coward?"

382
00:23:05,907 --> 00:23:08,306
I intend to give my all.

383
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,388
There is someone I want to beat.

384
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,956
Who? Me?

385
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:16,699
Let's see who gets the Woori City drama.

386
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,983
Good day.

387
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:23,077
Good grief, she's just like her brother.

388
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,012
Now, I want reimbursement for my camera.

389
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:29,996
- What if I refuse?
- What's a few bucks to you?

390
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,730
Then why even ask me to pay?

391
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,361
For me, 53 dollars is a lot.

392
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,285
I've never had a student who
displayed skills in cheating...

393
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,567
even before starting lessons.

394
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,144
- Here.
- I said no discount.

395
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:48,464
Three dollars.

396
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:49,945
I don't have any change.

397
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:52,265
For online deals, it's war even for ISF.

398
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,679
- ISF?
- Including shipping fees.

399
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:04,848
At least there is no interest.

400
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:05,848
Look here!

401
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:08,360
My name is Hun. Park Hun.

402
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:13,808
Yes?

403
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:16,631
He can't make it tonight?

404
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:19,462
Everyone has their reasons.

405
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,116
I'm busy myself.

406
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:25,827
No, I don't want to meet him next time.

407
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:26,958
Good day.

408
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,524
You got stood up.

409
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,393
Are you still single?

410
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,914
Get back to your book!

411
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,456
Is something wrong?

412
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,296
Are you sure the chef made it?

413
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,155
What's the matter?

414
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:00,721
It tastes a bit salty.

415
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:03,873
Dear me. How did you know?

416
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,660
Are you the one who made it?

417
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,371
I said, "No customers while I'm out."

418
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,065
Look, why weren't you at the cafe?

419
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,147
Hello there.

420
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:20,910
What did you do now?

421
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,757
I'm sorry, sir.

422
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:25,608
This customer came during
break time, so...

423
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:29,639
Look, come on now.

424
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,342
When you were out somewhere,

425
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:34,040
she wanted to make a sale for her boss.

426
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,422
Why are you walking all over
this lovely lady?

427
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:39,030
That's not what this is.

428
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,295
He walks all over me.

429
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,749
It's because I like him more.

430
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,064
Look, Min Ji Seon.

431
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:48,809
Regardless, you keep ditching
your cafe lately.

432
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,604
What's got you distracted?

433
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,229
I'm not distracted.

434
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,960
He is absolutely right.

435
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:59,069
It's your neighbor lady,
Gang Min Ju. Right?

436
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,146
Who? Your neighbor?

437
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:03,890
You come here.

438
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:09,121
Didn't she come to my bar a few times?

439
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:15,029
Then what about Ko Sang Sik?

440
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:21,027
Why are you acting this way?

441
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,282
I just wanted to clear things up.

442
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,690
You seem close to her.

443
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,332
If you keep behaving like this,
you can't stay here.

444
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,884
Do you understand?

445
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:31,883
Whether I like someone or get married,

446
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,466
you said you wouldn't care.

447
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,235
Aren't you just some girl I know?

448
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,972
Yes, I don't care. I won't care.

449
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,763
I'm happy with how things are.

450
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,884
Just seeing your face every day
makes me happy.

451
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:44,658
I can finally breathe.

452
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:46,118
That's an obsession.

453
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,519
Get rid of that thought and move on.

454
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:53,548
I'm trying.

455
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,548
I appreciate your letting me stay here.

456
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,252
Just don't say stuff to people.

457
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:01,748
If you say something like that again,

458
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:04,086
I won't let it slide. Remember that.

459
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:16,925
Is that woman still around?

460
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:24,862
Hello, Min Ju.

461
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:29,492
So what happened to your knee?

462
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:30,693
Something with cartilage?

463
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,418
She must be in a shock right now.

464
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:37,185
That's why you should exercise hard.

465
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,585
You keep missing workouts.

466
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,570
Exercising won't prevent aging.

467
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,985
At least it can delay it.

468
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:44,145
Look over there.

469
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:46,818
That sushi has kept going around.

470
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:48,247
This is the fifth time.

471
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,665
It's just like me.

472
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:55,545
After countless blind dates
and job interviews,

473
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:57,736
I've gotten old and shriveled up,

474
00:27:57,736 --> 00:28:00,417
always being left unwanted.

475
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,678
In the end, it would get thrown away.

476
00:28:05,623 --> 00:28:06,859
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

477
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:11,305
I never thought I'd lose my high heels.

478
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:14,176
But it's less about fashion with age.

479
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,508
Sneakers are way more comfortable.

480
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,408
I also wonder what I've been doing.

481
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,264
I'm still lost, like in my teens.

482
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:25,649
Things should be different by this age,

483
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:28,328
but I'm still worried about
the same things.

484
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:30,240
It doesn't seem fair.

485
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,699
I'm afraid it will never change.

486
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,073
Let's at least get married.

487
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:36,808
No, marriage isn't the answer.

488
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:38,952
- It's definitely not.
- Then let's date at least.

489
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,900
How are things with your neighbor?

490
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:45,774
Which neighbor?

491
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:46,995
Good heavens.

492
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,614
Why would it be that civil servant
instead of Jun Woo?

493
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,783
Min Ju, about Jun Woo...

494
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,007
I'll tell you exactly what I saw.

495
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,581
You know that mystery woman before?

496
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,271
I saw her working part-time at the cafe.

497
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:04,264
She was hung up on him,

498
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,998
begging him to let her stick around.

499
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:09,110
She seemed really into him.

500
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,005
That's some unresolved past.

501
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:12,540
Jun Woo is acting shady.

502
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,046
So that's what he meant before.

503
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,263
Did you already know?

504
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:18,430
He said he would tell me about her later.

505
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,925
I thought you finally found the one.

506
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,578
But nothing is easy.

507
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:38,388
You know that neighbor lady?

508
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:41,680
Do you think she would end up
marrying Jun Woo?

509
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,779
Ask her yourself if you're that curious.

510
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:51,540
They all look the same to me.

511
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,945
Not at all.

512
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,790
BigBang.

513
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,662
G-DRAGON, Taeyang, Dae Sung,
Seungri, T.O.P.

514
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:01,845
There are five guys.

515
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,402
T.O.P. is a coffee brand. He's TOP.

516
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:06,724
I knew that. TOP.

517
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,015
And this is BAP.

518
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,114
B.A.P.

519
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:15,136
Why does E.X.O. have so many guys?

520
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:16,928
That's EXO.

521
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:22,270
You should have studied English
like that back in school.

522
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,782
I mean, think about it.

523
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,513
I said T.O.P., but it's TOP.

524
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,752
So I said BAP, but it's B.A.P.

525
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:32,833
So I said E.X.O., but it's EXO.

526
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,846
What do you expect from me?

527
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,974
No wonder Ye Ji can't talk to you...

528
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,238
and says you lack love cells.

529
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,934
Do you by any chance
think they're cancerous?

530
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,463
That's why I'm trying.

531
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:46,430
Mothers love these idols like our own.

532
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:49,699
Do you stay home to watch TV?

533
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,655
Take care of Hun more.

534
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,211
Speaking of which,

535
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:57,835
I think a public loan could get
him to study abroad...

536
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,909
Here we go again with your talk.

537
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:02,304
I'm so sick of it. Seriously.

538
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:15,761
Yes, I'll pick up my laptop.

539
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,601
My word.

540
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,267
What are you doing?

541
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,569
This is hard enough, so don't talk.

542
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,049
Let me down. I'm heavy.

543
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,500
What if we trip down the stairs?

544
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:54,223
It's hard, right?

545
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,421
Park Jun Woo.

546
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:21,287
I like how you say my name.

547
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,765
Should we really give it a try?

548
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:49,965
While making all those romantic
and melodramatic series,

549
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,638
I've realized that in reality,

550
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,831
you hardly ever find great love...

551
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,184
or even fall head over heels.

552
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,286
That seldom happens.

553
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:07,172
Love is beautiful when it's young,

554
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:11,380
and I simply portray it in dramas.

555
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:16,073
The real estate isn't doing well
due to the school district.

556
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:19,073
Have you taken any vitamins lately?

557
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:21,200
Why would I need vitamins?

558
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,352
Even with all that exercise and yoga,

559
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:24,681
walking is the best.

560
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:26,727
Hiking works great.

561
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:28,346
Which mountain do you hike?

562
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:29,985
Just the hill near my house.

563
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,776
Love has drifted away,

564
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:37,199
losing its appeal to people my age.

565
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,962
Yet, I yearn to love again.

566
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:48,062
Having someone who cares deeply...

567
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:50,617
could become my last chance at love.

568
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:05,570
Do you mean what you said?

569
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:08,264
Then we're officially a couple now.

570
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:13,152
I wouldn't say it's official.

571
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:16,567
Let's just get to know each other.

572
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,430
That's the same thing.

573
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,727
No, it's different.

574
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,287
What's different?

575
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,608
You learn about each other as a couple.

576
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,469
This could be due to our age difference.

577
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,149
Starting a relationship means
you're an official couple.

578
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:35,420
But learning about each other...

579
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,326
What do you mean? Like a fling?

580
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,214
To have the excuse to break it off?

581
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:42,231
Is that what you mean?

582
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,541
I guess, in a way.

583
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,005
You should learn more about me,

584
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:50,381
and I don't know you well, either.

585
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,308
Are you scared?

586
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,320
What?

587
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,538
That means you're scared to commit.

588
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:01,515
Yes, I admit it.

589
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:06,321
At my age, it's hard to meet new people.

590
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,041
And dating gets even harder.

591
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,704
Why would it be more difficult with age?

592
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:13,074
Isn't it supposed to get easier?

593
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:15,241
More experience means deciding faster,

594
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:18,815
and you should know with intuition.

595
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,474
Whether you're right
for each other or not.

596
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,096
So what do you think?

597
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,706
You're genuinely pretty.

598
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:38,534
Good grief.

599
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:42,345
I do look handsome.

600
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:49,781
Taeyang, Seungri, TOP, Dae Sung,
G-DRAGON, BigBang.

601
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,065
- Hello.
- Hello.

602
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,297
Have a good day.

603
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,149
Hello. How are you?

604
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,669
Wait, is it Block B?

605
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:57,747
Right. Block B, ZICO, Taeil,

606
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:59,758
Jaehyo, B-Bomb, P.O...

607
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:01,605
P.O...

608
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:05,477
What is she doing there?

609
00:36:18,484 --> 00:36:20,764
EXO...

610
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:28,911
(Woori City Song with Woori residents)

611
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:34,452
Are you sure you can handle it?

612
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,541
What can we do now?

613
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,117
Ms. Han, stay strong.

614
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:39,163
Thanks.

615
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,219
If we give up on our city song,

616
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,483
it will disappear from history.

617
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,643
Yes, and if there is no response,

618
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:48,266
this is where it ends.

619
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,874
Let's think of it as our last...

620
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,511
and give it our best today.

621
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,550
It's like the resistance movement.

622
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,038
With a band of brothers.

623
00:36:57,038 --> 00:37:00,560
"Let's go, fight, win, team."

624
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,173
Okay.

625
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:05,384
Let's go, fight, win, team!

626
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,024
Boss!

627
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,240
- Hello.
- Where is your crutch?

628
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,428
I'm doing better now.

629
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:16,853
Are you sure you're okay?

630
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:19,389
If not, I can use the crutch
or get admitted to hospital again.

631
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,751
No, I need you to work with me.

632
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:24,646
I've made a hard decision to be here.

633
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,668
Thanks for saying that.

634
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,197
I mean it.

635
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:30,767
Someone in this world finally needs me,

636
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,812
and I'm glad about that.

637
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:36,182
I didn't think people could
understand my ways.

638
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,976
But now I've found an ally.

639
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:41,742
Thanks. I got through to you.

640
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,139
And about Jun Woo...

641
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,955
He may seem carefree and cheerful,

642
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,634
but he's an old man deep down...

643
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:53,690
with many wounds and immense loneliness.

644
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,595
He doesn't easily like or date anyone.

645
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:58,532
So when I heard that he likes you,

646
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:00,963
I became really happy for him.

647
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:04,006
Are you asking me to treat him well?

648
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,061
Yes, but I know you'd be good to him.

649
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:13,232
Jun Woo is a lucky guy.

650
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:15,474
He has a good friend like you.

651
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:19,558
No, we used to beat up each other kids.

652
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:20,967
We were like enemies.

653
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:26,417
Hello, Jun Woo!

654
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:29,530
It's nice to see you come out together.

655
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,248
Why didn't you give me a call?

656
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:33,579
Then you might run off to work again.

657
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,817
I'll take the subway from here.

658
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,274
You have some good sense.

659
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,010
Why don't you join us for dinner?

660
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,106
- I don't want to.
- No way.

661
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:43,645
I'm off.

662
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,673
Bye.

663
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:48,758
See you.

664
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:49,817
Shall we get going?

665
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:59,206
When you are tired and lonely

666
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:02,884
You should visit Woori City

667
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:06,524
The green forests are breezy cool

668
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:10,073
The coastal seas shine brilliantly

669
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:14,831
This place I moved to is truly strange.

670
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:18,431
Being alone doesn't feel alone.

671
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,023
Being apart rather feels connected.

672
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:26,951
There is more humanity than romance here.

673
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,692
Your vacation and life can be great

674
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:36,077
Make some fond memories

675
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:41,224
Then let's begin again

676
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,479
Visit Woori City!

677
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:54,410
You should visit Woori City

678
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,741
Its green forests are breezy cool

679
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,286
All together!

680
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:05,674
You're nothing like what I expected.

681
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,722
What did you expect?

682
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,657
I thought you'd only sit pretty.

683
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,767
That means luxury suit you well.

684
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:14,231
Since Jun Woo is in my life,

685
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:15,847
maybe that could be.

686
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:19,200
But why is he so distant towards you?

687
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,607
You treat him so well.

688
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:23,447
Maybe he doesn't like me that much.

689
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,928
No way. When you came last year,

690
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:28,150
you two were happy together.

691
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,878
They say things quickly change
between men and women.

692
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,049
You know everything.

693
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:36,795
So despite how things are,
he'll come around.

694
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,878
I like your positive way of thinking.

695
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,458
Wait, what's this?

696
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:48,074
I forgot to check my husband's
pockets before the wash.

697
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:49,457
Does he exercise?

698
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:50,457
Exercise?

699
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:53,258
What's this sports center?

700
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,889
He doesn't go near it.

701
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,473
Even when I ask to take a walk,
he keeps to the house.

702
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:59,196
Breathing is his exercise.

703
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:07,962
Did you know that kids in class
have a group chat?

704
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:08,985
Group chat?

705
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:10,241
That thing where kids gossip?

706
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,554
That's serious these days.

707
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,614
It's not about other kids, but you.

708
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:17,977
Me?

709
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:18,979
What about me?

710
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,443
Don't be shocked when you see it.

711
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,753
What's the big deal?

712
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:26,418
Why would I be shocked to see
what kids are saying?

713
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:28,560
My word.

714
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,645
What's gotten into him?

715
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:32,646
What a nerve with math dropouts.

716
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,524
Is it true he's switching schools?

717
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:37,422
- Hallelujah.
- No, I heard that since last year.

718
00:41:37,422 --> 00:41:38,485
He might stick around.

719
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:39,734
I hope he disappears soon.

720
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,469
Goodbye, captain!

721
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:42,641
Goodbye.

722
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:47,615
Don't get stressed too much.
It's just a few.

723
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:50,571
Why would it shock me?

724
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,911
These kids can't hurt me.

725
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:08,847
Punks.

726
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:13,196
Are you all right?

727
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,196
What?

728
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:19,558
Yes, I'm okay. My goodness.

729
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,535
Is there something wrong?

730
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,926
My existence only comes to this,

731
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:30,096
and it's pointless.

732
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,079
When I was younger,

733
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,021
I promised myself
I could do better next time.

734
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,597
But as I grow older,

735
00:42:39,597 --> 00:42:42,643
I'm not sure about doing better later.

736
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,982
And my confidence fades.

737
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:48,078
Perhaps you pushed yourself too hard.

738
00:42:49,244 --> 00:42:52,235
Being an adult is quite a challenge,

739
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:54,779
so you should give yourself rewards...

740
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,647
to keep going without wearing out.

741
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,967
Reward myself?

742
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:04,482
Getting to know and talk to you...

743
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,988
feels like a great reward.

744
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:11,116
Yes, I see.

745
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:58,378
I once had those moments
that shone beautifully.

746
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:02,914
I'll be back.

747
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,292
- Honey, wait a minute.
- What?

748
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:09,112
- Put this on.
- Did you make it?

749
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,124
Yes.

750
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:13,760
I only bought the pendant to add,
Sang Sik.

751
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:19,516
- Is it too big?
- No, it's perfect.

752
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:20,568
This is pretty.

753
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,279
- Ta-da.
- You got two made?

754
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:26,597
They are couple bracelets.

755
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,107
Bracelets that bring luck.

756
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:31,557
Now, only good things will happen.

757
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:33,551
Of course. Let me see.

758
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:37,175
Sang Sik, Hee Su. How pretty.

759
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:51,607
These moments are lost in the past,

760
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:56,100
but I still have my family shining.

761
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:11,662
Hello, there.

762
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:14,515
Who are you?

763
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:17,946
We met in Jun Woo's class.

764
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:19,078
Don't you remember?

765
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:24,715
Yes, you took his magazine.

766
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:25,715
Exactly.

767
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:29,662
I work here at Jun Woo's cafe.

768
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,452
I see.

769
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:35,635
It seems that his taste in women
has changed.

770
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:38,063
He wasn't interested
in older women before.

771
00:45:40,372 --> 00:45:42,083
You must like him a lot.

772
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:45,020
Yes, and since you make dramas,

773
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,501
you catch on quickly.

774
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:48,949
I detest trashy shows.

775
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,426
Especially in relationships like ours,

776
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:52,774
I can't stand them.

777
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:56,467
What do you mean by that?

778
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:58,522
Don't worry.

779
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,164
I won't pull at your hair.

780
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:05,799
You seem to have watched many
K-Dramas in Canada.

781
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,811
Min Ju.

782
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:14,637
What are you doing here?

783
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:16,781
I'm Min Ji Seon.

784
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:18,752
I wanted to say hello since
you're a neighbor.

785
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,101
Take care.

786
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,276
Are you okay? Did something go wrong?

787
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:30,048
Not really.

788
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:33,451
She's pretty and cute. Good grief.

789
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:42,018
I can't believe kids these days.

790
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:45,116
That looks like Ye Ji.

791
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,588
What? Where?

792
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:49,056
What?

793
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:53,075
Why, that little...
After talking about zero love cells,

794
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:55,021
that's what she does. I'll pull over.

795
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,295
Just go. She'd call you an old geezer.

796
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,566
It'd get more awkward if you stop here.

797
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,879
But still...

798
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:03,920
Good heavens, that brat.

799
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,332
I wish my dad would date like us.

800
00:47:09,332 --> 00:47:13,069
Then you might get a stepmom.
Would that be okay?

801
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:15,121
It doesn't matter at my age.

802
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:17,349
I've got my own life,

803
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:19,844
and my dad needs to live his.

804
00:47:19,844 --> 00:47:22,552
Given how tight-knit your family is,

805
00:47:22,552 --> 00:47:24,244
who would welcome a new lady?

806
00:47:25,272 --> 00:47:27,208
Like the lady next door,

807
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,672
he needs someone single and his age.

808
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:31,648
Then, get along with her.

809
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,719
But she won't do.

810
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:34,799
Why not?

811
00:47:36,027 --> 00:47:39,342
She breaks her word
and doesn't respect me.

812
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:43,141
Besides, Uncle Jun Woo already
claimed her as his girl.

813
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:52,021
You should go now.

814
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:56,523
I'll walk you to the door.

815
00:47:57,617 --> 00:48:00,801
No, it'll be a hassle if anyone sees you.

816
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:02,995
Why? Do I embarrass you?

817
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:04,759
Are we supposed to be dating in secret?

818
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:07,834
It's too soon to go public.

819
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:09,338
But why?

820
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:11,355
It's nothing…That's just how I feel.

821
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:19,019
Why that no good guy...

822
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:25,103
It seemed Hae Dam has a thing for you,

823
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,239
which got on my nerves.

824
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,839
Don't get me wrong.

825
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,519
I'm not interested in her.

826
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:30,791
I know.

827
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,953
That's why I'm here with you.

828
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:38,646
My goodness, that little punk...

829
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:39,666
You get inside.

830
00:48:44,743 --> 00:48:46,324
You're back.

831
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:47,650
Where is Sang Sik?

832
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,162
He's having an emergency regarding Ye Ji.

833
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:51,034
What? What do you mean?

834
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:54,795
- Sang Sik.
- Give it here.

835
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:00,670
I'm home.

836
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,045
- Were you at the study cafe?
- Yes.

837
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:05,663
It's late. You should be more careful.

838
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:09,774
When will my son ever end up
in a study cafe?

839
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,861
It's too stuffy in there.

840
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:14,155
Your future is what's stuffy.

841
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:16,245
I want some watermelon.

842
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:20,941
Here.

843
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,313
Dad.

844
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,452
Hurry and get changed.

845
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:29,780
What do you need?

846
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,256
We need to talk.

847
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:32,870
Talk, I can hear you.

848
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,264
What are you up to lately?

849
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,545
What do you think?

850
00:49:36,545 --> 00:49:39,682
It's school, tutoring, and the study cafe.

851
00:49:39,682 --> 00:49:41,180
I don't mean that!

852
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,592
You told me I lack love cells.

853
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:44,085
Is it because you're busy dating?

854
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,842
Who told you that?

855
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:49,042
Why does that even matter?

856
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,363
You were out with a boy...

857
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:52,826
Dad, I'm 15.

858
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,049
I liked boys back in elementary school...

859
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:56,979
and even in kindergarten.

860
00:49:56,979 --> 00:49:59,762
You didn't care then, so why now?

861
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,499
Well, that's because...

862
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,307
You're all grown.

863
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:06,763
And why are you showing so much skin?

864
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:09,923
It's summer, and it's too hot.

865
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:14,118
You'd better not meet Hyun Seok
in something like that.

866
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:17,394
I've had enough of this.

867
00:50:19,812 --> 00:50:21,472
Look, where are you going?

868
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:24,303
Ye Ji!

869
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,074
This is so nerve-racking.

870
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:30,263
What now? What happened?

871
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:33,826
I saw Ye Ji and her boyfriend...

872
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,500
Did they kiss or something?

873
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,361
Yes. Should I worry?

874
00:50:38,895 --> 00:50:40,613
You said you trust her.

875
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:43,294
Trusting doesn't mean I can't worry.

876
00:50:43,294 --> 00:50:45,973
What if people say it's because
she has no mother?

877
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:47,230
Come on, seriously.

878
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,950
Then, find her a stepmom.

879
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,340
Even if you don't marry again,
you should at least date.

880
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,399
Yes.

881
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,200
You guys are pathetic.

882
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,294
Ye Ji.

883
00:50:59,396 --> 00:51:01,475
I know you're dating Uncle Jun Woo.

884
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,067
Would you like it if I shared that online?

885
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:06,294
Either keep your word as an adult,

886
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:08,350
or don't make promises, to begin with.

887
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,561
Don't you think you should be clear
in your actions and words?

888
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,668
Are you done talking?

889
00:51:14,932 --> 00:51:16,467
I'll hear what you have to say.

890
00:51:16,467 --> 00:51:18,363
Just to be clear,

891
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:21,310
I never told anyone about your secret,

892
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,700
especially not your father.

893
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,010
But I saw it with my own eyes
and heard it clearly.

894
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:29,658
What?

895
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,640
I overheard you tell him.

896
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,154
That's why he said this.

897
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:36,624
That you shouldn't decide alone,
but tell him right away.

898
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:39,144
So that I can grow up well.

899
00:51:39,144 --> 00:51:40,424
It was in his study.

900
00:51:40,424 --> 00:51:41,563
Wait a minute.

901
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:48,007
I don't know what caused you
to storm in here like this,

902
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:50,544
but let's go back to the beginning...

903
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:52,536
to figure out this misunderstanding.

904
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:54,559
You caught me kissing Hyun Seok,

905
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,516
and then you blabbed to my dad!

906
00:51:56,516 --> 00:51:57,883
What did you say?

907
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:06,327
You're the one who kissed him,
and not the other way?

908
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,844
What is she talking about?

909
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:12,663
You can ask her yourself.

910
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,554
You saw this but didn't tell me?

911
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:18,454
How could you be so deceitful?

912
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,863
Come on, I never deceived you.

913
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,745
Keeping silent can be a lie.

914
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:25,351
You pretended not to know,
and that's even worse.

915
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,087
What's bad about that?

916
00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:31,126
At her age, it's a normal phase
with her boyfriend.

917
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:32,424
Boyfriend?

918
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:35,468
So do you kiss your friends?

919
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,337
Excuse me?

920
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:40,191
I mean, what I'm saying is...

921
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,603
Well, you know...

922
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:43,824
She's just a kid...

923
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:45,216
and only in middle school.

924
00:52:45,216 --> 00:52:47,895
You should have told me that
she did such a thing.

925
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:49,560
Such a thing?

926
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,670
You make it sound so wrong.

927
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,141
You're telling me they kiss...

928
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:55,368
With a peck...

929
00:52:57,498 --> 00:52:59,554
Why didn't you tell me about this?

930
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:01,085
Kids can kis...

931
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,283
They can give each other pecks.

932
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:06,170
She's not your daughter.

933
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,394
Is that why you're speaking this way?

934
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:12,473
What's wrong with kids showing
their affectionate feelings?

935
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:14,609
It's perfectly okay to hold hands...

936
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,850
and give a peck on the cheek.

937
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,292
Ye Ji is old enough to know better.

938
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,403
No!

939
00:53:20,403 --> 00:53:22,587
Not my daughter!

940
00:53:22,587 --> 00:53:24,842
No boy will lay a finger on her!

941
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:27,126
- Dad.
- You don't have a say without a kid.

942
00:53:27,126 --> 00:53:30,349
Don't act like a grown-up saying that!

943
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:32,445
Why are you yelling at her?

944
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:33,755
Just scold me.

945
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:37,681
Fine, come with me.

946
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:40,762
This is annoying.

947
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,252
My goodness.

948
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,469
Anyway, you're pretty awesome.

949
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,584
You're quite the modern woman.

950
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:49,207
Modern woman?

951
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,889
Where are you going?

952
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:56,652
- Just follow me.
- Dad.

953
00:53:58,556 --> 00:54:00,459
So, did Ye Ji get you good?

954
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:01,837
Yes.

955
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:04,963
Then came another blow from Chief Ko.

956
00:54:04,963 --> 00:54:06,219
What?

957
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:09,547
Anyway, about Min Ji Seon...

958
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:10,881
Ji Seon?

959
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,416
She seems to like you a lot.

960
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,930
You see, back in Canada,

961
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,619
I worked in her kitchen as an assistant.

962
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:23,712
The family was well off.

963
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:25,990
But she was an only child with her
parents facing divorce,

964
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,910
so I felt bad seeing her alone.

965
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,002
That's why I made her Korean dishes.

966
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:34,600
A few years ago, her parents
died in an accident,

967
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,880
and she came looking for me.

968
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:38,934
Have you tried his boiled rice
with assorted mixtures?

969
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:40,585
The one he made.

970
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:41,585
No.

971
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:45,844
- What about his beef and vegetables?
- I haven't.

972
00:54:46,938 --> 00:54:47,958
Okay.

973
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:49,979
What?

974
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,372
It's nothing.

975
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:57,185
I wanted to tell you, but I thought
you'd get me wrong.

976
00:54:57,185 --> 00:54:58,490
I'm sorry.

977
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,906
Before returning to Canada in a month,

978
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:03,604
she wants to practice breaking up with me.

979
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:05,861
Is that hard to understand?

980
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:08,231
No, I get it.

981
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:09,272
What?

982
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,025
You're not jealous or doubtful at all?

983
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:15,308
Should I feel that way?

984
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:17,396
You're too chill about it.

985
00:55:17,396 --> 00:55:19,680
Then I should have told you sooner.

986
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:27,797
Anyway, I hope that Sang Sik
and Ye Ji talk it out.

987
00:55:27,797 --> 00:55:30,197
She is sensitive in her puberty.

988
00:55:30,197 --> 00:55:32,628
It's more like her dad is in puberty.

989
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:33,707
Why do you say that?

990
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:36,251
"Do you kiss your friends?"

991
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:37,638
What was that about?

992
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:45,031
What?

993
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:46,549
What is it?

994
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:49,236
It's nothing.

995
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:03,283
Like what she said,
I'm expressing my feelings.

996
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:04,767
What's the harm in that?

997
00:56:05,535 --> 00:56:07,627
You're not old enough for that stuff.

998
00:56:07,627 --> 00:56:09,667
Is there some specific age?

999
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,019
Then what's the required age
to hold hands, to give pecks,

1000
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:13,847
or even to kiss my boyfriend?

1001
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:15,763
Is there some textbook or law about it?

1002
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:17,586
Why are you dictating that?

1003
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,156
I'm not dictating anything.

1004
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:21,915
These things come with being an adult.

1005
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,692
I'm not a kid anymore.

1006
00:56:23,692 --> 00:56:25,781
I'm on my way to adulthood.

1007
00:56:26,427 --> 00:56:28,118
As a kid, you used to praise me...

1008
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,246
for behaving all grown-up.

1009
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:33,324
But now, you make it sound
like growing up is bad.

1010
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:37,901
Well, becoming an adult isn't all good.

1011
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:41,767
Love and dating don't follow
a strict schedule.

1012
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:45,593
We can feel romantic at any point
in time of our lives.

1013
00:56:45,593 --> 00:56:47,316
Does it come at any time?

1014
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,087
Is it really that easy?

1015
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:51,834
What counts is that I know how I feel...

1016
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:53,786
and can keep myself in check.

1017
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:54,873
Ye Ji.

1018
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:02,281
To tell you the truth,

1019
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,434
watching you grow up each day...

1020
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:09,007
makes me scared and afraid.

1021
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,776
You're afraid of me growing up?

1022
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,926
No, but seeing you grow up and change,

1023
00:57:15,926 --> 00:57:18,998
makes me unsure about
how to change myself.

1024
00:57:18,998 --> 00:57:21,233
That makes me confused and scared.

1025
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,329
I haven't experienced this before.

1026
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:28,675
I'm new to it.

1027
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,319
The moment you were born,

1028
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,455
when you turned 5 and 10,

1029
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,622
and when you turn 20 and 30.

1030
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,490
I'll always be a first-timer.

1031
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,150
Just when I'm used to everything...

1032
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,797
and have things under control,
you grow again.

1033
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,262
I wonder how you'll turn out,

1034
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:52,733
and though it's new and exciting,

1035
00:57:53,652 --> 00:57:56,547
I worry that I might not handle it.

1036
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:58,747
As much as you're growing well,

1037
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,509
I want to be there keeping pace,

1038
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,765
but I get nervous about failing.

1039
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,460
Without your mom,

1040
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,570
I should know everything better.

1041
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,251
Even if I can't replace her,

1042
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:14,960
I want to be the best dad for you.

1043
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:19,468
But despite what I want,

1044
00:58:19,468 --> 00:58:21,223
I worry about not being able to keep up.

1045
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:25,991
Ye Ji.

1046
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,157
I remember talking to your mom here.

1047
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:36,358
When you were still growing in her belly,

1048
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:41,130
I vowed to try my hardest.

1049
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,782
Because when you come into this world,

1050
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:47,367
it would be new and strange.

1051
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:50,405
That was my promise to her.

1052
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:09,470
Even if I'm a bit clumsy...

1053
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,292
and can't keep up with how
quickly you grow,

1054
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:19,526
I hope you don't hate me or feel let down.

1055
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,349
Good heavens.

1056
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:36,486
You're all grown.

1057
00:59:59,577 --> 01:00:01,398
Do you kiss your friends?

1058
01:00:14,522 --> 01:00:15,809
My goodness.

1059
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:52,340
Love and dating don't follow
a strict time schedule.

1060
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,187
We can feel romantic at any point
in time of our lives.

1061
01:00:56,187 --> 01:00:57,898
Does it come at any time?

1062
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,526
Is it really that easy?

1063
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:02,390
Ko Sang Sik.

1064
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:06,271
Do you have feelings for me?

1065
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:22,958
Do you mind if I come inside?

1066
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,880
Sure, please come in.

1067
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:30,432
What brings you here?

1068
01:01:36,229 --> 01:01:37,887
Am I the only one who remembers?

1069
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,249
That night in this room...

1070
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,921
Well, you see...

1071
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:57,934
So you already knew.

1072
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:05,107
Whether I like someone or not,

1073
01:02:05,107 --> 01:02:07,550
why would it matter in my life?

1074
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,247
It won't change anything.

1075
01:02:09,662 --> 01:02:11,229
Why is that?

1076
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,620
Even if I like someone,

1077
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,213
it won't make any difference in my life.

1078
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:23,320
But you didn't tell me.

1079
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,785
After all, it won't change anything.

1080
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:27,692
It won't make a difference.

1081
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:28,717
Min Ju.

1082
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:30,862
Didn't you say keeping silent is a lie?

1083
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,222
To be honest...

1084
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:39,553
I'm dating someone now.

1085
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:47,760
I felt like I should tell you.

1086
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:50,743
I see.

1087
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:53,697
That's good.

1088
01:02:59,501 --> 01:03:02,944
Is it really a good thing?

1089
01:03:04,669 --> 01:03:05,669
You wanted it.

1090
01:03:05,669 --> 01:03:08,296
To love someone with all your heart.

1091
01:03:11,546 --> 01:03:12,647
Right.

1092
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,244
I intend to.

1093
01:03:21,808 --> 01:03:23,004
Then...

1094
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,708
I'll get going.

1095
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:29,467
Wait.

1096
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:50,043
This here.

1097
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,181
It's exactly like mine.

1098
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,809
That can't be.

1099
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:02,243
Mine has "SS" marked on it.

1100
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,713
I lost someone I love.

1101
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:19,248
We were to even get married.

1102
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,270
No!

1103
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,504
No!

1104
01:04:29,485 --> 01:04:30,584
Don't let go!

1105
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,576
Don't let go!

1106
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:01,212
(Second to Last Love)

1107
01:05:01,515 --> 01:05:04,570
From now on, I'm your top priority.

1108
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,207
Jun is my everything.

1109
01:05:06,834 --> 01:05:09,026
Don't play games with your life.

1110
01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:11,201
How do you know Chief Ko?

1111
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:13,347
Have you moved on now?

1112
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:14,538
From Eun Ho?

1113
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:16,514
Aren't we the perfect match?

1114
01:05:16,514 --> 01:05:17,514
It seems so.

1115
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,147
So you're going to let Jun Woo take her?

1116
01:05:19,147 --> 01:05:20,307
Are you guilty about something?

1117
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:21,619
I think so.

1118
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,192
If this bad feeling turns out to be true,

1119
01:05:24,192 --> 01:05:25,788
I couldn't live through it.

1120
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:28,066
