1
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,633
You still came.

2
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:18,786
But you were supposed to take
Min Ju to that party.

3
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,299
Don't talk.

4
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,769
Pumping your stomach hurts your neck.

5
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,242
I know you like that guy.

6
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,157
Sang Sik?

7
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,480
But it seems that...

8
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,202
he has feelings for Min Ju.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,177
Didn't you have plans with Jun Woo?

10
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:57,121
I got stood up today.

11
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,602
You got stood up?

12
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,261
It serves me right.

13
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:03,210
Why are you saying that?

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,659
Love found me after a long time,

15
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,855
but I couldn't fall in love.

16
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,534
I might have failed.

17
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,108
So what?

18
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,249
So what if you fail?

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,144
You said those words make you feel better.

20
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,057
Just take your time.

21
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:40,617
Don't rush to think it's a failure.

22
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,768
Jun Woo.

23
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,765
Did you wait long?
I'm sorry for being late.

24
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,167
No, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,255
What should I do?

26
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:35,263
I don't want to lose either you or him.

27
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,038
Sang Sik.

28
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,151
Are you still going to run?

29
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,238
Why can't you face it?

30
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:50,159
How long are you going
to hide your feelings?

31
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:09,604
We need to talk.

32
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:24,898
(Second to Last Love)

33
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,600
(Episode 11)

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,971
Exactly where should I begin?

35
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:36,514
I'll start by saying
what I wanted to say today.

36
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,031
The chefs' party.

37
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,615
You said it was a plus-one.

38
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,600
I agreed to come,

39
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:51,114
but it felt overwhelming.

40
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,328
It's not because of our age difference
or what others think...

41
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:57,954
but because of how I feel.

42
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,646
Are the feelings you have for me...

43
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,691
not quite enough?

44
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,159
You're young and amazing,

45
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,250
and yet you desire an older woman.

46
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:14,397
That might never happen again.

47
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,569
So I was surprised and felt grateful.

48
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,922
But as it happens,

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,058
it wasn't my love for you,

50
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,491
but my longing to find love...

51
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,315
and to feel that way.

52
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,153
Who cares? You can be like that.

53
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:42,878
I don't think I should.

54
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,508
I wanted to be with you...

55
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:49,124
because of the guy...

56
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,061
I was to marry in the past.

57
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:56,436
You spoke about him.

58
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,563
I've let him go,

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,556
and many years have gone by,

60
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,548
but it seems I haven't forgotten.

61
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,242
I'll wait for you.

62
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,493
Park Jun Woo.

63
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,122
Carried away with my feelings,

64
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,922
I may have acted rashly at times.

65
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,929
But don't shut me out completely.

66
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,691
That was impulsive in front of Sang Sik.

67
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,211
I apologize for that.

68
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:33,775
But I have no regrets.

69
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,122
I meant it, and I acted out of fear,

70
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,605
I was afraid of losing you.

71
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,374
Fearing you might leave.

72
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,637
Did you know how he feels?

73
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,013
What?

74
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,906
Are you still going to run?

75
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,491
Why can't you face it?

76
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,564
How long are you going
to hide your feelings?

77
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:32,606
Why didn't you tell me?

78
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:35,348
Tell you what?

79
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:37,141
Sang Sik.

80
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:39,932
- You seem to misunderstand.
- What?

81
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,437
How is it a misunderstanding?

82
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,503
I'm not sure if she told you.

83
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,982
There was a man she was to marry.

84
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,007
I know.

85
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,160
I knew him.

86
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,421
What?

87
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,071
Here.

88
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,906
("Paradise for Youth")

89
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,727
What does this mean?

90
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,856
One of its crew members...

91
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:14,546
was the guy who was to marry her.

92
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,306
Eun Ho.

93
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,816
Jang Eun Ho. You know the name.

94
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,796
As you fully know,

95
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,225
in the blaze that happened,

96
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:31,664
he clung to me for dear life.

97
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,538
But I couldn't save him.

98
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,807
How did this even happen?

99
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:43,091
Regardless of the pressing deadline,
I should've halted the shoot.

100
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,193
And to escape from that guilt,

101
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:50,888
I struggled desperately, changed jobs,

102
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,619
and took a civil servant exam.

103
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:57,483
But even after all this time...

104
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,394
Sang Sik.

105
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,965
Saying she doesn't matter would be a lie.

106
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,255
However,

107
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:10,835
knowing that you're there for her...

108
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,901
filled me with gratitude.

109
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,688
It must have been hard on your own.

110
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,313
No, I'm fine but worried about you.

111
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:22,824
Given how things are,

112
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,840
I know you must be feeling upset.

113
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,937
Why would you say that?

114
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,482
You're the one who had to endure it.

115
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:32,702
That's all there is.

116
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,381
So you don't have to worry about me.

117
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:40,883
Look, don't be like that.

118
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:44,619
I know how you feel. How could I not?

119
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,078
You haven't felt this way in a long time.

120
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,335
I know.

121
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:58,434
You couldn't have said it any differently.

122
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,630
I get that.

123
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,501
But let's not resort to cowardice.

124
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,270
Please think about that.

125
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,417
I have my own fears about...

126
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:21,959
messing things up with you and Min Ju.

127
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,365
But I refuse to be spineless.

128
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,377
Goodness.

129
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:45,796
You're without any friends or a lover.

130
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,384
How long are you going to drink alone?

131
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:53,930
So what if I have neither?

132
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,900
TV dramas are full of love stories,

133
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,427
but after hitting 40 or 50,

134
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:04,821
you start to lose interest.

135
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,491
Reality is a far cry from it,

136
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,484
so you resort to living vicariously.

137
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,408
I have guests coming to work tomorrow.

138
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,885
Which one looks better?

139
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,369
(The first one)

140
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:30,278
Come on,
I'm still keen on dating and love.

141
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,447
I want to take walks holding hands.

142
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,303
For me, I'm more concerned about...

143
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,256
how to live my remaining years.

144
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:41,687
Despite doing what I love,

145
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,477
I could get sacked if I lose
my passion or ability.

146
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,186
Then what will I do?

147
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,867
It's fortunate that you can think that.

148
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:01,024
After struggling to make it far,

149
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,339
there is even a chance to worry.

150
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:08,003
You've done well coming this far.

151
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,676
Thank you.

152
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:24,489
Still, I don't want to return
to my youthful days.

153
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,760
I guess it's been a hard journey.

154
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,723
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

155
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,743
Being an adult doesn't mean
I don't get lonely.

156
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:48,792
But let's not love only for that.

157
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,479
I can still be happy alone,

158
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,361
and there are some merits as well.

159
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,358
As an adult,

160
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,561
I've strived not to be a coward.

161
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:23,055
But to protect what's dear to me,

162
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,322
there were times when I had to be.

163
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:31,520
Whether it's my dear love or family,

164
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,954
I can't bear any more loss.

165
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:09,306
Jun Woo.

166
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,034
Yes?

167
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,247
Too bad you couldn't make the party.

168
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,924
I can always go next time.

169
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,296
But you were looking forward to it.

170
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:25,081
How is Ji Seon doing?

171
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,294
She's still at the hospital.

172
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:30,983
Some rest will do her good.

173
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,321
It looks like you need that
rest at the hospital.

174
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,392
You look quite unwell.

175
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,098
That's when you need...

176
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,162
Ta-da.

177
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,745
What's this?

178
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:51,666
Have you already finished it?

179
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,243
No, not yet.

180
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,227
I've only written the opening part.

181
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:57,302
This is really something.

182
00:13:57,302 --> 00:14:00,069
I have to submit it tomorrow,

183
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,637
but you can see it first.

184
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:02,892
Of course.

185
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,309
I'm always your first reader.

186
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,545
I'll take a good look.

187
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,414
How did you find me here?

188
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:29,487
Jun Woo told me, obviously.

189
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:33,679
I envy you.

190
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,687
You can like someone this much.

191
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:40,487
Whether it's obsession or love,

192
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,273
you care more about him than yourself.

193
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:45,771
What are you trying to say?

194
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,331
I said not to throw away your life.

195
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:55,384
Life goes on, without the dead.

196
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:57,715
I'm not obsessed with Jun anymore.

197
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,067
I've given him up.

198
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,411
So you can go ahead...

199
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:04,450
Sure. How about I marry him?

200
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,373
I should be romantic with him
like we're newlyweds.

201
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,037
That makes you jealous, right?

202
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:13,419
So recover and get back to me.

203
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,650
And let you be cool all by yourself?

204
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:33,306
You said trying hard isn't love.

205
00:15:34,953 --> 00:15:38,859
But love demands great effort.

206
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,593
Although you long to be ever so close,

207
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,452
distance serves you better.

208
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,760
Even when wanting to intervene,

209
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,219
it's wiser to let things slide.

210
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,800
I thought not playing hard to get,

211
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,986
and granting him some space...

212
00:15:56,986 --> 00:16:00,766
might help keep love alive.

213
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:05,002
Perhaps love thrives...

214
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:10,487
on both patience and effort.

215
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,076
One half of it is sacrifice,

216
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,676
while the other half is pain.

217
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,644
That could be why love hurts...

218
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,716
and yet remains precious.

219
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,155
You know everything.

220
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:37,729
With your looks and talent,
why act like a fool?

221
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:41,205
Your audition score was a D-plus.

222
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,790
D-plus?

223
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,070
I think you're far from getting there,

224
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,963
but if acting is what you want,

225
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:48,977
give me a call.

226
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,707
And make sure you eat well.

227
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,346
This is so annoying.

228
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,337
She beat me again.

229
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,878
(Don't be sick, get better!)

230
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,127
Leave me alone, Dad.

231
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,670
It may feel like everything is over,

232
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:33,799
but you'll face Hyun Seok tomorrow.

233
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:38,656
With time, you could be friends again.

234
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:43,951
I'd rather transfer schools than see him.

235
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,185
You miss him...

236
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,506
and want him to call you.

237
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,516
No.

238
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:57,833
Forget him. I'll focus on my studies.

239
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:02,336
Feeling this way and caring...

240
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:04,194
is just too hard to bear.

241
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:14,953
You'll face more situations like this.

242
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:20,080
It could hurt even more.

243
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,956
No, I don't want it again.

244
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,579
I understand.

245
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,731
Letting someone in and getting hurt...

246
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:35,365
is tough even for adults.

247
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:40,498
So don't bear it alone, okay?

248
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:41,498
Dad.

249
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,099
Hun, you put these away.

250
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,939
- Where are you going?
- Going off to exercise.

251
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:16,722
I'll be back.

252
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,091
Mom, I'm hungry.

253
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,532
Dad left his phone.

254
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,344
Person Staying at Home?

255
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Me?

256
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,321
The Grim Reaper?

257
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,092
My brother? Good grief.

258
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:39,872
What are you doing?

259
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,426
(Aegyeong Sports Center)

260
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:42,731
Aegyeong?

261
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:46,343
Aegyeong Sports Center.

262
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:47,956
Three-eight-seven...

263
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,617
Hun.

264
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,857
Is my phone over there?

265
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,453
- Yes.
- Give it here.

266
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:54,453
Here, Dad.

267
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:58,361
How long is she going to keep silent?

268
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,763
You said you couldn't talk to her.

269
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,740
I'll be back.

270
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:07,574
Okay.

271
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:15,100
You're here early.

272
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,800
Aren't you working too hard?

273
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:21,092
Please check what I've got so far.

274
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,142
My goodness.

275
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:25,587
You've gotten this far already?

276
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:27,036
You picked up speed.

277
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:30,306
I felt pressured without Ms. Na.

278
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,790
Well done. I'll review it.

279
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,817
Okay.

280
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:40,032
About Jun Woo...

281
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,665
He seems to be hurting.

282
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,890
Where?

283
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,485
It might be this spot.

284
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,578
You see...

285
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:57,393
I don't know what's with you guys,

286
00:20:57,393 --> 00:21:01,003
but if you feel different now,

287
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:04,198
I hope you are gentle with him.

288
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,227
Okay.

289
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:09,440
Come in.

290
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,008
Look, Ms. Na is back.

291
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,944
- Ta-da.
- Hello, Boss and Ms. Ko.

292
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:16,225
Ms. Na.

293
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:19,072
Goodness, why are you like this?

294
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:20,831
I was worried about you.

295
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,775
You were hurt because of me.

296
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:24,207
Me? Hurt?

297
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,500
That's even more upsetting.

298
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,692
Can't you be nicer to Ms. Ko?

299
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,940
Drop the pretense and pride.

300
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,246
Excuse me?

301
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:34,500
Where else can you find such a lovely,

302
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,045
pretty, and talented writer like Ms. Ko?

303
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,839
- Don't you agree?
- Right.

304
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,437
This is unnecessary.

305
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:43,572
Sorry.

306
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,721
Thank you to all the networks...

307
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:52,250
for showing interest in our
first city drama.

308
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,673
We're on the lookout for content...

309
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:58,580
that leads Hallyu packed with
fresh and fun ideas.

310
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,624
As you prepare for the submission,

311
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:05,338
Woori City will provide the location
and other materials...

312
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:07,873
you may need for the production.

313
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:12,036
So please submit your great work
before the deadline.

314
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,385
Ms. Na, stop looking at your mirror...

315
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:22,684
and give this a look.

316
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,420
Doesn't it feel like a date?

317
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,420
What?

318
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,956
I wouldn't know about dating,

319
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,930
but it feels like going on a picnic.

320
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,643
Picnic?

321
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:38,788
You're so pure and cheerful.

322
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:40,326
Picnics are great.

323
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:45,379
Is there some kind of legend here?

324
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:49,953
Yes, it's about a guardian deity
protecting the village.

325
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,523
You need a drink, Chief Ko?

326
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,019
No, I'm good.

327
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,672
- Wait, give it here.
- Okay.

328
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,576
Please have a drink.

329
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:02,938
Thank you.

330
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,608
I'll fill you in on the legend
once we get there.

331
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:08,666
Okay.

332
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,633
Who knew we'd be working together?

333
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,522
I know. We had a lot happen.

334
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:17,400
Chief Ko.

335
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,621
Are we going to these places today?

336
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:24,733
Yes, we're going there.

337
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,823
Chief Ko, wait a minute.

338
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,991
Your tie is crooked.

339
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,491
Ms. Han, don't worry about it.

340
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,193
Chief Ko, since we're out,

341
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:37,163
how about a movie after work?

342
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:38,865
Why would we do that?

343
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:42,371
I got you the tickets last time.

344
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,597
Sorry, I made it too tight.

345
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,016
It's okay. That's enough.

346
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:54,761
Chief Ko, we're almost there.

347
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,868
Okay.

348
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,106
This place is amazing.

349
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,979
It's a great spot for scenes.

350
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,948
I didn't expect such a place.

351
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:08,011
This tree is 400 years old.

352
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,490
Since it's considered a deity,

353
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,387
the village folks gather here
on New Year's Day...

354
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:13,905
and pray for longevity and health.

355
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,307
Does the young potter legend
originate from here?

356
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:17,727
Yes, how did you know?

357
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:21,013
I saw it in Ms. Ko's webtoon.

358
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,913
- Is there a legend?
- Yes.

359
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:27,191
There was once a young potter...

360
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:29,344
who loved a woman more than his life.

361
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,757
The day before their wedding,

362
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:33,205
the woman who was to meet him here...

363
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,725
suddenly passed away.

364
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:36,021
My goodness. Why?

365
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,844
The gods who had envied their love...

366
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,144
stole her away from him.

367
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:45,468
So the potter stayed in this spot...

368
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,092
and cried his eyes out.

369
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:50,380
Then from where his tears fell,
the tree started to grow.

370
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,613
And until his hair turned gray,

371
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:54,644
he looked after it carefully.

372
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:57,637
But what's strange is,

373
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:00,084
there were no blossoms from it.

374
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,581
Why not?

375
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,037
The potter grew old and died,

376
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:07,748
but he returned as a bird
to settle on the tree.

377
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:11,527
That's when it started to blossom.

378
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,101
He loved her till his death
and even after,

379
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:16,259
and that devotion bloomed in love.

380
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:17,538
We got you some treats.

381
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:19,523
Here are bread and soymilk.

382
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,226
- Thank you.
- Enjoy them.

383
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,183
- Are you thirsty?
- Good work.

384
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:36,737
What are you thinking?

385
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,624
The potter loved his betrothed
even after she died.

386
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,672
No.

387
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:46,815
He loved her even after his own death.

388
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,480
Is that really love?

389
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:54,468
It's probably a legend since it's rare.

390
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,027
Perhaps the story...

391
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,406
weighs heavy on your heart.

392
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:11,253
My life has been quite dull.

393
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:15,511
Despite being so busy, it felt dull.

394
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:19,561
Nothing ever happened.

395
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:23,008
And just like how it has been,

396
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:25,142
I think it would remain that way.

397
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,229
I often feel the same way.

398
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:34,021
It was no different when dating him.

399
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,617
Both being so busy,

400
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,447
we never rode the Namsan cable car...

401
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:45,376
or walked holding hands in theme parks.

402
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:51,873
I regret that so much.

403
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,798
Those days will never be back,

404
00:26:57,011 --> 00:27:01,518
but I let them slip away.

405
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:08,598
Time is still passing by.

406
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,260
Do you have feelings for Chief Ko?

407
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,408
Excuse me?

408
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,056
I heard you two are neighbors.

409
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:45,048
But are you really just friends?

410
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:47,374
Does Chief Ko tell you all that?

411
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:51,517
Of course, we keep no secrets
from each other.

412
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:56,286
But you seem to be hiding something.

413
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,811
What would I be hiding?

414
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:01,468
Your feelings.

415
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:05,392
You would know that from making dramas.

416
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,444
The subtle hints and shared signals.

417
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:09,529
What?

418
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:13,033
Anyway, I've got dibs on Chief Ko.

419
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:15,378
So even if you're interested,

420
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:19,357
I prefer that you nip it in the bud.

421
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,145
Since you live next door,

422
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:26,962
Chief Ko is probably too nice
to shrug you off.

423
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:30,229
And I can't do much about that.

424
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:31,287
Ms. Han.

425
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,956
Can you own up to your feelings?

426
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,038
"Own up to them?"

427
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,004
I know you like Chief Ko.

428
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:40,508
But can you truly understand Chief Ko...

429
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,192
and all that comes with him?

430
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:45,876
Why should I?

431
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:47,606
It's not like we're getting married.

432
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,244
Then, aren't you just playing games?

433
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:53,788
You claim to have feelings for him...

434
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,628
but disregard how he might feel...

435
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:58,285
or what it's like in his environment.

436
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,902
Isn't that too blind to call love?

437
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,498
What else can it be?

438
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:05,489
You know fireworks, right?

439
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,930
Feelings could blaze up suddenly,

440
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,863
then disappear like smoke.

441
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:17,106
Even if you can't be a 500-year-old tree,

442
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,650
at least consider how he feels...

443
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,123
and own up to your feelings
before you call it love.

444
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:26,366
Just consider it if you really like him.

445
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,332
Good luck.

446
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:37,744
What? She must be head over heels.

447
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,371
Sweetie!

448
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,083
Sweetie, why are you outside?

449
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,589
Who is that?

450
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,985
Was he following you?

451
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:17,713
What are you doing?

452
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:21,967
Hello. What brings you here?

453
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,023
Well, I'm here for groceries.

454
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:27,244
Right. You came for groceries.

455
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:28,655
Did you get a lot?

456
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,549
I'll take your bag for you.

457
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:34,676
No, it's okay.

458
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:37,314
I should hold one for you.

459
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,415
No.

460
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,306
How is Ye Ji doing?

461
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,979
Ye Ji? Why do you ask?

462
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:47,229
Just curious.

463
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,930
After breaking up with her boyfriend,

464
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,778
she's cooped up in her room.

465
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:54,124
That's too bad.

466
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:57,884
Her boyfriend wanted to be left alone.

467
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,776
- You saw it happen?
- Yes.

468
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,646
He always walked Ye Ji home.

469
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:06,142
But why did he suddenly do that?

470
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,631
He wants to be left alone?

471
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,268
Isn't it strange?

472
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,124
You're lonely when by yourself,

473
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,981
but it's a hassle to be with someone.

474
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,334
It's always like that.

475
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,840
Is that why...

476
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:29,105
you called things off with Jun Woo?

477
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,705
There were some personal issues,

478
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,817
but I didn't feel comfortable.

479
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:44,762
Nothing beats the comfort of being alone.

480
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:48,031
Yes, single life has its perks.

481
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,861
My goodness, I forgot to share this.

482
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,124
Is anyone home?

483
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,676
Are you not there?

484
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:19,581
- Looking for Sang Sik?
- Yes, I got this from the store.

485
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:23,756
We were supposed to share,
but I took it home.

486
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:24,766
I see.

487
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:29,236
Now you get groceries together...

488
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:31,061
and even share what you buy.

489
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,645
At first, you used to fight every time.

490
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:41,103
It's a good change.

491
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,317
Give this a try.

492
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:01,120
I blended a whole kiwi in it.

493
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:09,144
You made all these choices for me.

494
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,983
Whether I'm hungry,

495
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:15,630
what's good for me to eat,

496
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,509
where I'd like to go.

497
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:21,966
You made decisions for my sake.

498
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,818
I know I should feel
comfort and gratitude for that.

499
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,639
I'm sorry I couldn't get used to it...

500
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,008
and pushed you away like that.

501
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,719
Why are you feeling sorry?

502
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,036
It can be uneasy since
you're more used to deciding.

503
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,062
I understand.

504
00:33:46,062 --> 00:33:48,437
I probably lack love cells,

505
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:51,933
seeing how I can't fall for a guy
who is nice and wonderful.

506
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:56,641
Remember what you said?

507
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,404
About how, being deceived by emotions,

508
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:03,060
I could have overestimated you?

509
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:05,290
I get it.

510
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,915
Like Ji Seon and my mother,

511
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,509
I hate women who cling to men.

512
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,046
That's why I was drawn to you.

513
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:17,895
And perhaps what I feel isn't love.

514
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:23,020
Nevertheless,

515
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:27,812
you're still a grown woman to me.

516
00:34:30,663 --> 00:34:31,878
A grown woman?

517
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:42,631
I don't want it to get awkward.

518
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:46,298
So I'll be mature like an adult...

519
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:50,089
and try to feel better.

520
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:19,637
What life remains on my untraveled path?

521
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:28,195
What will my future look like...

522
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:29,748
when I'm all alone?

523
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,780
Will life be different...

524
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,185
from how I've been until now?

525
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:47,761
Or will it be the same?

526
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:58,042
I would like to hold hands
and smile in the end...

527
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,997
with someone by my side.

528
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:04,111
It'd be nice to have that someone.

529
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:10,127
It'd be nice to have that someone.

530
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,894
- Jun Woo.
- Hello, Sang Sik.

531
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,253
Where are you going?

532
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:33,325
I'm going on a food trip.

533
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:35,317
Jun Woo.

534
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:37,803
Come on. I've always gone like this.

535
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:38,935
Don't worry.

536
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:41,864
Park Jun Woo.

537
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:44,876
Make sure you eat well.

538
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,273
- When are you coming back?
- I don't know.

539
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,056
I wanted to be with you...

540
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,699
because of the guy I was to marry.

541
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:09,899
I'm sorry.

542
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:13,899
I don't want it to get awkward.

543
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,771
I'll try to feel better.

544
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,107
Thanks.

545
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,343
Eleven years younger?

546
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:44,308
- Yes.
- It's good that you ended it.

547
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:45,957
How could you date such a guy?

548
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:48,244
Birds of a feather flock together.

549
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,852
Having similar jobs, environment,

550
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:52,637
and age makes it last and is better.

551
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,704
Just like me.

552
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:57,315
How are we even comparable?

553
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:59,894
When you have nowhere else to go,

554
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:01,345
I was going to live with you.

555
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,271
Who is living with whom here?

556
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,143
I got divorced.

557
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:06,705
I'm better than that younger...

558
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:09,384
Age isn't why we broke up.

559
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:12,463
People like you weigh all sorts of things.

560
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:15,032
Like reputation, ability, potential,

561
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:19,088
how long there will be income,
and if kids are a viable option.

562
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,251
And with you being an only child,

563
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,378
you'd have to worry about
supporting your in-laws, and more.

564
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,139
Compared to such geezers,

565
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,439
he showered me
with pure and innocent love.

566
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,175
If you liked him so much, why end it?

567
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,640
Forget it. Don't pry anymore.

568
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,657
Anyway, I'm relieved it's not Ko Sang Sik.

569
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,542
Why does that matter to you?

570
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,542
What?

571
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:45,835
You don't know what life he's led...

572
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,718
and what happened in the past.

573
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:52,290
Trust me. He isn't right for you.

574
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,423
I'm off.

575
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,145
What's that?

576
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:04,089
The firefly festival flyers are out.

577
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:05,277
Let me see.

578
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,496
What about us?

579
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:11,345
We're working our youthful days.

580
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:12,873
(Cable rides at the Woori Firely Festival)

581
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:16,606
It was no different when dating him.

582
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,447
Both being so busy,

583
00:39:18,447 --> 00:39:22,240
we never rode the Namsan cable car...

584
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,931
or walked holding hands in theme parks.

585
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:29,655
Next week will be even busier.

586
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,882
We have this festival and the drama.

587
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,271
Chief Ko, how about a movie today?

588
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,882
Ms. Han, I'm really busy.

589
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,458
Chief Ko, wait.

590
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,504
When will we catch a movie?

591
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,609
Dad, where are you going?

592
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:56,944
I'm just going...

593
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,650
Look here, Ye Ji.

594
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,010
How do I look?

595
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:06,787
- You look younger.
- Really?

596
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,587
Don't forget to study.

597
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,547
What's got into him?

598
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,923
Here.

599
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:55,787
Where are we going?

600
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:58,820
- Where do you want to go?
- What?

601
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:00,939
We can go anywhere.

602
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,806
Is there something wrong?

603
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,005
No, it's nothing.

604
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:29,752
What are you doing here?

605
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:32,153
I knew you'd be like this.

606
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:35,552
Why didn't you even call?

607
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:39,825
If I did, you'd say you're in
Yeosu or Pohang.

608
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:41,432
I know you well.

609
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,440
I came because work isn't going well.

610
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,603
What's wrong? It looked good last time.

611
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:49,499
Ta-da.

612
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,241
What's this?

613
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,984
Since you always prepare the food,

614
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:56,476
you never had what others made, right?

615
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:01,203
Here, try my spicy treat.

616
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,619
What do you think?

617
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:07,742
It's too salty.

618
00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:10,812
And it's too spicy.

619
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:11,823
Really?

620
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:14,165
Just kidding.

621
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,470
You little punk.

622
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,081
I put so much work into it,
worried about you.

623
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,084
Good heavens.

624
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:26,515
You can't mess with me.

625
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,002
Mi Rye, look up there.

626
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:48,649
There are many stars today.

627
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,811
That's why I like it here.

628
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:56,713
Are you okay?

629
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,080
About what?

630
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:06,162
There are many women like the stars.

631
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,228
I'm over there.

632
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:12,394
What?

633
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:16,138
Goodness.

634
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,873
Thanks.

635
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,580
Why are we here?

636
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,122
There is a festival next week,
so I'm here for an inspection.

637
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:38,122
"For an inspection?"

638
00:43:38,122 --> 00:43:40,426
It takes place day and night.

639
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:44,306
You can think of local officials
as being always on call.

640
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,665
Is that right?

641
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,735
But why did you bring me?

642
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:52,278
I'm not good at these rides.

643
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:54,134
Yes, I remember.

644
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,150
You struggled at the concert...

645
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,488
when you danced on the crane.

646
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:01,486
You never forget that.

647
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:03,719
So how can I help you here?

648
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:05,531
Ride with me like last time.

649
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:17,282
It's okay.

650
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,267
I really hate being high.

651
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,911
It's beautiful.

652
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,070
Isn't it nice?

653
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,008
Yes, it's really nice.

654
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:42,798
Some people say we live to marvel.

655
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:45,845
Marveling at birth, the first steps,

656
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:46,940
speaking the first words,

657
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,965
tasting something delicious,

658
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,941
and seeing breathtaking views.

659
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:54,596
We are wowed by all that.

660
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:58,072
Yes, maybe that's why people are
so eager to travel.

661
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,209
But you haven't done much.

662
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,566
You haven't ridden cable cars...

663
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:08,793
or even been to theme parks.

664
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:12,011
Is that why you brought me here?

665
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:13,434
Well, it's for both.

666
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:15,566
I've got to inspect for the festival.

667
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:20,804
Is there something?

668
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:24,684
No, it's just a habit.

669
00:45:24,684 --> 00:45:26,229
I've rushed all my life.

670
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,737
Don't look at the watch.

671
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:34,482
Always live in the present.

672
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,323
How do you know that line?

673
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:45,042
It's from the movie, "Nobody Loves Me."

674
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,237
That's right.

675
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,616
Is it okay to wander here this late?

676
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:56,649
I'm the person who takes charge.

677
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:59,267
Who would complain when
I'm here to inspect?

678
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:08,593
Goodness, he works hard even this late.

679
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,568
You said it was okay.

680
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,628
Yes, but bringing my girl...

681
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,209
Bringing a friend doesn't look good.

682
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:17,228
Hurry this way.

683
00:46:17,786 --> 00:46:18,997
Be quiet.

684
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:21,081
Where are you taking me?

685
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,956
Just follow me.

686
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:26,970
Good heavens, are these fireflies?

687
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,686
Yes, this way.

688
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,691
It's time for the fireflies to show up.

689
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:33,691
Take a look.

690
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:37,998
It's incredible and beautiful.

691
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,027
Is it worth coming?

692
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:43,272
Yes, I'm glad we sneaked in.

693
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:47,825
You can't see it during the day
and it's rare in Seoul.

694
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:51,061
Of course. I'm glad that I moved here.

695
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,602
Because of the fireflies?

696
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,057
No.

697
00:46:55,057 --> 00:46:56,674
Because of my good neighbor.

698
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:00,811
Do you mean me?

699
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,437
Not just you but also your family.

700
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:06,930
Goodness me.

701
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,256
You said they always cause trouble.

702
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:12,817
The days aren't supposed to be all quiet.

703
00:47:12,817 --> 00:47:15,049
That's life.

704
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:16,650
Rather than living alone,

705
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,020
it's good to be bustling like fireflies.

706
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:28,503
- Did you catch one?
- Yes.

707
00:47:28,503 --> 00:47:29,564
My goodness.

708
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,751
Maybe it's not open.

709
00:48:05,751 --> 00:48:07,139
Did the owner go somewhere?

710
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,196
I wonder where he went.

711
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:26,863
Hmm?

712
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:30,694
Wait a minute.

713
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:53,441
You!

714
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,504
Just close the curtains.

715
00:48:57,324 --> 00:48:58,632
It's okay.

716
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,147
- What's okay?
- Just don't mind him.

717
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,338
Chief Ko.

718
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:04,391
What are you doing?

719
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:08,127
Why would you interrupt? Just go.

720
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,466
(Past Lover, Current Lover)

721
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,648
I turned off the sign outside.

722
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:18,471
You should have locked the door.

723
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:21,070
What did we even do?

724
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,003
You came, so we couldn't do anything.

725
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,456
What are you saying?

726
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,560
Are you okay?

727
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:32,527
We meet here again.

728
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:34,608
Yes, I know.

729
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:37,499
Are you dating each other?

730
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:43,831
- No.
- No.

731
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:46,942
Then what are you doing? I'm disappointed.

732
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,725
What's there to be disappointed about?

733
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,719
How about we raise our glasses?

734
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,000
Sure.

735
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,288
It's good to see you.

736
00:49:55,288 --> 00:49:56,364
Love shot?

737
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:00,786
Have a treat with it.

738
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:02,051
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

739
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,585
Let's dance.

740
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:10,189
Of course.

741
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,735
This place should be right.

742
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:26,086
Who is that? I might know her.

743
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:29,482
Goodness, I remember now.

744
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:32,061
Welcome... What?

745
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:34,198
Aren't you friends with my neighbor?

746
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:35,516
Yes, that's right.

747
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:37,469
Are you here to exercise?

748
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,036
No, that's not why.

749
00:51:40,036 --> 00:51:43,612
Have you seen my husband here?

750
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:45,716
Who is your husband?

751
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:47,300
Park Cheon Su.

752
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,040
Wait a minute.

753
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,113
Park Cheon Su.

754
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,962
There isn't anyone like that.

755
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:59,577
Really? I guess it's not here.

756
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:02,020
Why don't you call him?

757
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,665
No.

758
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:06,585
You should come over next time.

759
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,018
Work out here next time.

760
00:52:08,018 --> 00:52:09,785
- Yes, thank you.
- Take care.

761
00:52:09,785 --> 00:52:11,348
- Have a good day.
- Goodbye.

762
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:23,466
Thanks for this treat.

763
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:27,354
What did the woman who left say?

764
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:28,854
She was looking for her husband.

765
00:52:30,274 --> 00:52:31,961
Why? Do you know her?

766
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:33,780
What? No.

767
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,857
I had a good exercise.

768
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:37,211
I see.

769
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:38,740
Are you going to just leave?

770
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:42,071
There is stuff to take care of.

771
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,216
All right, then.

772
00:52:44,216 --> 00:52:45,278
Take care.

773
00:52:50,824 --> 00:52:53,523
(Aegyeong Sports Center
Name: Richard Park)

774
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:55,439
Ms. Koo, how was the movie today?

775
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:56,673
It was fun.

776
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,047
But wasn't it too steamy for a movie?

777
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,431
I shouldn't have watched it with you.

778
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:01,904
What are you talking about?

779
00:53:01,904 --> 00:53:04,239
I'm a grown-up man now.

780
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:08,181
- Who said you were a girl?
- Goodness.

781
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:09,613
Have you been on many blind dates?

782
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:11,245
No, not really.

783
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:12,318
Are you trying to get married?

784
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,391
No, I'm looking for a date.

785
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:18,746
Kids these days really aren't
into marriage.

786
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:22,747
How can I decide on a life partner
in just three minutes?

787
00:53:22,747 --> 00:53:24,504
It takes me 30 seconds now.

788
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:30,634
Ms. Koo, we should meet for treats.

789
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:32,122
Sounds good.

790
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:34,405
If I'm free without a date.

791
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:41,993
- Welcome home.
- Hello, there.

792
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:43,458
Stealing money and valuables,

793
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:46,338
thieves on the street are causing trouble.

794
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:49,407
They assault women returning
home late after work...

795
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:51,599
to snatch their valuables.

796
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,219
SBC's reporter Son has the full story.

The Woori City police on the 10th...

798
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:01,360
have charged three men who robbed...

799
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,665
and assaulted women coming home late.

800
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:05,150
Ye Ji.

801
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,466
Don't go anywhere and stay home, okay?

802
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,549
Where are you going?

803
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:41,259
Hello, Yeong Ae.

804
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:42,854
Have you received Ms. Na's email?

805
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:46,498
I'll take a look at home.

806
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,930
Yes, I'm almost there.

807
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,962
Okay. I'm hanging up.

808
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:56,444
You must be coming home.

809
00:54:56,444 --> 00:54:59,372
Yes. What are you doing here?

810
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:00,716
What do you mean?

811
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:02,603
You were following me.

812
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:05,740
What? I didn't know it was you.

813
00:55:09,754 --> 00:55:11,876
For real. Let's go.

814
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,356
Where are you going?

815
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:15,944
That's not the way home.

816
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,899
I have something to take care of.

817
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,755
Where are you headed?

818
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:23,762
To the post office.

819
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:25,454
But it's closed by now.

820
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,362
Why are you coming with me?

821
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:41,309
I might as well since it's a quick stop.

822
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:46,115
Why didn't you get it delivered
to the house?

823
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:49,333
Did you think it was unsafe?

824
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,820
That's one reason.

825
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,551
I wanted to pick it up on my way.

826
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:55,497
What is it, anyway?

827
00:55:56,188 --> 00:55:57,605
Beats me.

828
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,164
People at my old place...

829
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:01,022
called me about a parcel that came.

830
00:56:01,022 --> 00:56:02,624
So I had it sent here.

831
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:04,830
There it comes.

832
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:09,492
- Are you Gang Min Ju?
- Yes.

833
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:10,492
Wait a minute.

834
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,366
- I need your signature.
- Okay.

835
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,044
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

836
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:25,436
What is it?

837
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:26,436
(Sent by Happy Nursing Home)

838
00:56:26,436 --> 00:56:27,436
A nursing home?

839
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:32,567
Who sent it?

840
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:36,581
It's from...

841
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:41,549
my late boyfriend's mother.

842
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:46,563
I hadn't received it in a while,

843
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:48,534
so I thought she had gotten better.

844
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:54,893
I guess she hasn't forgotten me.

845
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:33,527
- You killed him!
- Stop it.

846
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:34,958
- You killed him!
- Mom.

847
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,398
Come out now!

848
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:38,045
Come out now!

849
00:57:38,045 --> 00:57:43,004
How could this even happen?

850
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:45,259
How could this happen?

851
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:26,668
Ms. Jang.

852
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,193
Ms. Jang, I'm here.

853
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:37,509
Who is this?

854
00:58:38,486 --> 00:58:39,486
Yes.

855
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:42,879
Min Ju is here.

856
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:47,668
You're so pretty.

857
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:52,912
How can you be so pretty?

858
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:58,162
You're still pretty as well.

859
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:02,465
I shouldn't have sent it.

860
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:05,530
No.

861
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,535
This was my last time,

862
00:59:08,535 --> 00:59:09,849
so don't come anymore.

863
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:13,666
Eun Ho would want that.

864
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:20,858
You'd only feel hurt coming here.

865
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:28,569
Haven't you met a guy?

866
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:36,040
Are you still single?

867
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,289
If Eun Ho knew,

868
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,032
he'd feel bad about it.

869
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,389
You should meet someone...

870
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,085
and be loved now.

871
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:55,292
I'm okay.

872
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:58,646
You should watch your health.

873
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:07,836
It's all good for me now.

874
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,173
Before I die,

875
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:15,986
I just want to know...

876
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:21,415
why it was my son who died.

877
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:29,503
Someone should have told me.

878
01:00:31,246 --> 01:00:36,566
Someone should have taken responsibility.

879
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:41,351
The bastards.

880
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,911
They are bastards.

881
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:49,585
Ms. Jang.

882
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:58,614
My poor son.

883
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:42,622
I don't know what this says.

884
01:01:42,622 --> 01:01:44,538
It seems to be a name.

885
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:45,586
"SS..."

886
01:01:45,586 --> 01:01:48,229
What was his name?

887
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,604
Jang Eun Ho.

888
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,301
You're home.

889
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:17,411
Yes.

890
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:19,036
Ko Sang Sik.

891
01:02:25,027 --> 01:02:29,309
Why were you nice to me that day?

892
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:33,948
You showed me the fireflies
and rode a cable car with me.

893
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,203
Well, it was because of the inspection.

894
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,234
The movie quote you said in the cable car.

895
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,249
Yes?

896
01:02:47,991 --> 01:02:50,083
My late boyfriend...

897
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,379
used to say it all the time.

898
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:56,484
So I won't race against time,

899
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:00,484
but enjoy the present.

900
01:03:03,273 --> 01:03:04,372
Is that right?

901
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:06,397
To be honest,

902
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:11,052
I visited his mother today.

903
01:03:14,154 --> 01:03:16,174
You mean at the nursing home?

904
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:18,397
Yes.

905
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,725
Is she doing well?

906
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,262
No.

907
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:29,462
Things aren't looking good.

908
01:03:30,529 --> 01:03:34,621
She has advanced pancreatic cancer.

909
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:40,140
Before she passes away,

910
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:43,862
I want to ease her deep sorrow.

911
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,202
No one came forward to explain
when she lost her son.

912
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,080
The fire was from spontaneous combustion,

913
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:58,546
so there wasn't anyone to blame.

914
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:06,145
He probably stayed back to save everyone,

915
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,914
and couldn't get out in time.

916
01:04:12,335 --> 01:04:13,522
Gang Min Ju.

917
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:18,554
Why are you telling me this?

918
01:04:19,912 --> 01:04:21,376
Chief Ko.

919
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:27,184
You talk about principles, safety,
and responsibility,

920
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,343
and take them seriously.

921
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:32,270
So what's your point?

922
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:36,718
Even though it's all in the past,
I want to know.

923
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:40,566
I need to know the truth.

924
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:58,175
The bracelet he clung to at the end...

925
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,126
Wasn't it yours?

926
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:14,767
The one marked with "SS."

927
01:05:22,526 --> 01:05:24,037
Being grown-up means...

928
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:26,823
taking responsibility for one's choices.

929
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:34,352
Are we truly owning up to our decisions?

930
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:44,904
