1
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:06,817
We can talk it out at the house!

2
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,617
Please let go of me!

3
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:10,329
Are you guilty about something?

4
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:11,742
Sang Hee, what's going on?

5
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:13,054
Min Ju.

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,056
Ae Gyeong.

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,079
Ae Gyeong.

8
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:21,496
Richard?

9
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,768
Richard?

10
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:26,855
You're showing your true colors now!

11
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,525
What, Richard? Come here!

12
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:30,842
Good heavens.

13
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:33,187
Richard? He's my husband!

14
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:35,369
- What?
- What are you doing?

15
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,347
- Ae Gyeong, are you okay?
- No.

16
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,315
You! Park Cheon Su!

17
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:41,867
You come over here!

18
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,824
Let me go!

19
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,619
What are you doing to me?

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,443
- Let go! I'll talk!
- How could you do this?

21
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:54,292
Let go! How could you do this to me?

22
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:58,129
Let go! How could you do this to me?

23
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,016
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

24
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,542
Who are you calling crazy?

25
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,143
You're the ones who are crazy!

26
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,016
How could you cheat on me?

27
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:08,897
Cheat on her?

28
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,110
What?

29
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,360
Sang Sik!

30
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:20,305
I can't believe this.

31
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:26,416
(Second to Last Love)

32
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:28,494
(Episode 16)

33
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,616
For crying out loud!

34
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,937
Are you two really married?

35
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:36,994
Explain yourself.

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,146
- It's not like...
- You'd better talk!

37
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,882
I'm sorry,

38
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:49,547
Just give me a chance to explain.

39
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,742
Explain what?

40
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:53,588
You stayed out nights going to the gym.

41
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,324
How often? How many times?

42
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,682
It's not what it looks like.

43
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,402
Yes, it's all a misunderstanding.

44
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,170
We just met a few times and talked.

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,506
There was only some occasional talk.

46
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,906
Yes, that's right.

47
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,817
And I had no clue he was her husband.

48
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:19,148
Why would I see someone who's married?

49
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:21,253
Tell them!

50
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,779
Did you even pretend to be single?

51
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,227
I'm worried.

52
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:34,376
Min Ju just moved back, and this happens.

53
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:37,376
I can't believe Cheon Su did that to her.

54
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,656
They probably just know each other.

55
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:42,458
I'm sure it's just a mix-up.

56
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,255
By the way,

57
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:46,400
what were you trying to tell me before?

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,130
What was between the pages?

59
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,736
Did you even read the comics?

60
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,401
Just a bit.

61
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,220
- And you didn't feel anything?
- What?

62
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:00,425
I mean, did it make your heart skip...

63
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:02,434
or give you butterflies?

64
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:03,912
Are you kidding me?

65
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:05,824
You didn't even write it, so why?

66
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,711
We are exactly like its characters.

67
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,171
We? We are like them?

68
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,971
Forget it. Just don't read it.

69
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:14,471
Don't you ever read it, okay?

70
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,745
You'd better not.

71
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,498
You still think I'm a kid, don't you?

72
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,465
What now?

73
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,705
I honestly didn't know.

74
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,970
He wasn't here when I showed up.

75
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,817
This is unbelievable.

76
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,916
How could he act single?

77
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:50,201
Weren't you at the hotel together?

78
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,786
You said he was too naive...

79
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:53,958
and didn't want to be his first love.

80
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,090
Yes.

81
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm shocked myself.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,264
But nothing happened between us.
I sent him home.

83
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,789
Well, that's so great.

84
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,723
How could he act this way as a teacher?

85
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,395
Teacher?

86
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,548
He works at a school?

87
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,572
You should have checked that before!

88
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:16,070
This is so embarrassing.

89
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,836
Please believe me.

90
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,428
The relationship isn't what you think.

91
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,091
Then why did you see her?

92
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,289
You even pretended to be single
and lied about your job.

93
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:31,424
It was for a companion.

94
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,222
I don't have one in my life.

95
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:35,270
A companion?

96
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,709
Are you crazy? What about Sang Hee?

97
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,554
Just hear me out.

98
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:44,610
They say married couples are companions,

99
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,302
- but it's not always like that.
- What did you say?

100
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:50,070
It might be hard for you to get,

101
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,878
but many couples can relate these days

102
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,894
because they aren't companions.

103
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:59,080
But it's not like they face big issues.

104
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,142
Holding back what we truly feel,

105
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,686
many couples live together
only to keep up appearances.

106
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:09,294
Are you saying my sister is only that?

107
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,750
Well, not exactly.

108
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,758
When it comes to companions,

109
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:19,726
you should be able to discuss
what concerns you in life.

110
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:22,518
If that's your spouse, all the better.

111
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:24,973
But that's not always the case,

112
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,640
and it could be someone else.

113
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:32,049
Like a friend, regardless of gender.

114
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,719
Sort of like a soulmate.

115
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,103
Commit to your family.

116
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,646
Whether soulmates or companions,

117
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,918
you should find them close to home.

118
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,182
Then are Ye Ji, Mi Rye,

119
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,734
and Sang Hee your companions in life?

120
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:49,253
They go on with their own lives,
but what about you?

121
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:51,421
Why are you dragging me into this?

122
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:55,375
Companions walk alongside you in life,

123
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,749
and share your thoughts and experiences.

124
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,933
But I don't have someone like that.

125
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:05,052
I haven't been able to connect
with Sang Hee for a while.

126
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,446
Are you trying to justify what you did?

127
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,037
I am in the wrong.

128
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,730
I apologize.

129
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,778
My friend didn't know about the truth,
and messed things up.

130
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,356
I don't know what to say.

131
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,234
This shocks me as well.

133
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,744
You're older than me,

134
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:28,025
but took good care of yourself.

135
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:31,499
Well...

136
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,687
I don't know how much
I should believe about them.

137
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,618
But I shouldn't have grabbed at her hair.

138
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:45,887
You'd get why if you were in my shoes.

139
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:48,087
Of course, I understand.

140
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:51,865
Whether she knew or not, it was wrong.

141
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,600
Ignorance is no excuse.

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,168
I'll confront her about it.

143
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,168
Min Ju.

144
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,261
They won't see each other anymore.

145
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,549
Wait...

146
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,049
My goodness.

147
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,123
Just go.

148
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,729
- Gang Min Ju.
- What?

149
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,242
I'm glad that you moved back here,

150
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,240
but you shouldn't treat me like this.

151
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,150
What?

152
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,923
Even if Ko Sang Sik is important to you,

153
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:26,082
your friend got played for a fool
by his brother-in-law.

154
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:28,895
But you're not even concerned for me.

155
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,542
What did I even do wrong?

156
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,373
It's just that...

157
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,350
If there needs to be an apology,

158
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,277
I should get one from that family.

159
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:42,133
And you shouldn't lash out at me,
but at those people.

160
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,165
Your friend was duped into this mess.

161
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,646
Why scold me and make me apologize?

162
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,605
- You see...
- Forget it.

163
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,343
Friendship took a backseat today.

164
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:56,585
Your man is all that matters.

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,169
Ae Gyeong.

166
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,385
Good grief.

167
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,903
You barely even speak to me.

168
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,666
What's so great about that woman?

169
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,353
She's your wingless angel,

170
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,242
and I'm a person who stays at home?

171
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,386
Park Cheon Su.

172
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,538
You should be with people.

173
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,204
Why live with a homebody
and sleep with an angel?

174
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,025
I didn't sleep with her.

175
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:44,514
So after treating me like some furniture,

176
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:45,514
all of that was for conversation?

177
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,424
You shut me out and turned your back.

178
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:49,975
But after making me starve like that,

179
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:52,719
you were so attentive to her.

180
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,326
You know, I want a person.

181
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,208
I want a person to talk to.

182
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,670
Do I speak alien to you?

183
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,822
I want someone who understands
and connects with...

184
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:03,883
I'm...

185
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,241
I'm a person.

186
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,553
I'm a person, too.

187
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:14,862
I have bent over backward
for you all these years.

188
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:18,668
You sold meds you got from
the principal's wife.

189
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,719
I couldn't stand that.

190
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:23,427
That embarrassed me at school.

191
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:24,799
It was humiliating.

192
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:27,309
Even in the summers,

193
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,277
to make a few bucks,

194
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,148
you rented out our house.

195
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:35,453
So we had to camp in the yard.

196
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,191
I'm so sick of it.

197
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,640
Do you think I want to live this way?

198
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,133
The more you scrimp and save,

199
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,288
the more it wears me down.

200
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,672
Make do with what we've got.

201
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:59,207
And don't even think about
sending Hun abroad.

202
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:07,697
Sang Hee.

203
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:11,220
Sang Hee, are you okay?

204
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:16,765
Mi Rye.

205
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:22,956
After giving up my dreams,

206
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:27,572
I thought caring for my family
was the best thing.

207
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,547
But what's this?

208
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,091
How did it come to this?

209
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,980
Don't cry.

210
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,476
Did your friend really not know about it?

211
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,090
Of course, she didn't know.

212
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:55,849
Even if she married and divorced young,

213
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,795
my friend knows right from wrong.

214
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,395
Your brother-in-law is the problem.

215
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,440
He's usually more thoughtful.

216
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,544
But he deceived her.

217
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,879
He lied about his job and marriage.

218
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,680
My friend is the victim here.

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,784
It's been a struggle to get this far.

220
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,560
Why should we argue over this?

221
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:20,714
Tell me about it.

222
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,136
How is your friend?

223
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:28,351
She stormed off, disappointed in me.

224
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:30,349
Disappointed?

225
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,244
She felt that I wasn't taking her side.

226
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,716
I must have spoken like your family.

227
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,347
That's too bad.

228
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,226
What was he even thinking?

229
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,293
Sang Hee is such a great wife.

230
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,913
Perhaps she didn't meet all his needs.

231
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:57,599
Even so, he shouldn't have done that.

232
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,631
Sang Hee is my sister,

233
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,602
but maybe she has her own issues.

234
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,847
But he's the one who cheated.

235
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:09,565
Why are you assuming it's her problem?

236
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:11,589
He's to blame for this.

237
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,086
Two women were played like fools.

238
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,893
Of course, what he did was wrong.

239
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,069
He shouldn't have deceived them.

240
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:22,232
But if Sang Hee had been more attentive,
it wouldn't have happened.

241
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,876
Sang Hee is such an ideal wife.

242
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:29,583
She chose her family over her dreams.

243
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,509
It never struck me until now,

244
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,551
but you seem to be somewhat macho.

245
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:40,215
Macho?

246
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:46,151
It hits harder when older people cheat.

247
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,725
Are you worried that I might cheat?

248
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,911
How would I know? Men are all the same.

249
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,271
Goodness gracious.

250
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:58,562
So how do you like it here?

251
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:00,042
I arranged everything on my own.

252
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,275
We can move things around if you want.

253
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,426
No, I really like it.

254
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,818
How did you manage it so perfectly?

255
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,677
It's like a surprise gift.

256
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:12,344
This was what I could do for you.

257
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,006
Thanks.

258
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:19,466
It shows how much you care.

259
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:23,099
Talk to your friend about this issue.

260
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:24,877
I will apologize later.

261
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:31,060
Married life doesn't seem so easy.

262
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,736
But if there is love between you,

263
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:36,635
it's better to live together than alone.

264
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,627
- I should get going.
- Okay.

265
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:52,265
Anyway, don't think about leaving,

266
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:53,445
but stay in this house.

267
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:55,660
Okay.

268
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,900
That wasn't a proposal, was it?

269
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,570
Where should I leave this?

270
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,159
It would be nice here.

271
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:35,678
Are you that glad?

272
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:36,845
What?

273
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,541
You look really happy.

274
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,565
It's like you've become a newlywed.

275
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,539
Don't be ridiculous.

276
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,827
I'm glad for you.

277
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,597
Don't let her get away, okay?

278
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,533
Thanks.

279
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:53,171
Let's clean up since it looks settled.

280
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,339
Okay.

281
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:05,635
Cheon Su really messed it up.

282
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:06,882
How is Sang Hee?

283
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,861
She's devastated.

284
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,388
What were you doing?

285
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,654
It's nothing.

286
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,523
What's all this?

287
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:18,635
I was just looking for a place.

288
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,036
Are you going to move out?

289
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:22,295
I was just checking it out.

290
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:25,777
I was only checking.

291
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,533
How is it with Ko Sang Sik?

292
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,070
He's full of himself.

293
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,950
That time on the ferry,

294
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,591
he fended for everyone in the hailstorm.

295
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:43,040
So just corner him with the ferry,

296
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,678
but bump up the drama budget, okay?

297
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes, I'm already on it.

298
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,264
Of course.

299
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,389
The ferry was damaged in the hailstorm.

300
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,397
Did you supervise the repairs
before the drama event?

301
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,302
It was a shoddy repair before,

302
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:04,196
so there were already many defects.

303
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,084
I've seen the papers you submitted.

304
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,706
Director Shin blamed it on the contractor.

305
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,882
If he had checked the guidelines,

306
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:17,163
there wouldn't be broken windows
or even cracks on the ferry.

307
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:19,369
Director Shin is no facility expert,

308
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,770
so it would have been difficult to tell...

309
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,171
what materials were used there.

310
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:28,042
Do you mean there needs to be other
evidence or witnesses?

311
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,690
Exactly.

312
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,514
But it was you who oversaw
the recent repairs...

313
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,641
before the ferry was damaged.

314
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,811
So you will be in the hot seat.

315
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,770
What?

316
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,143
And since the repairs were rushed
before the press event,

317
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,623
there is suspicion surrounding your ties
to Producer Gang.

318
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:48,433
The event was held to recoup
the wasted funds...

319
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,563
and to promote the ferry project.

320
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,910
What is your connection to Producer Gang?

321
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,392
Is there a special bond?

322
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,400
What do you mean by "special?"

323
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:06,109
Is there any personal attachment...

324
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:08,183
or any feelings you have for her?

325
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,464
Answer the question.

326
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:16,806
Yes.

327
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,271
She is someone I love.

328
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:24,895
Min Ju.

329
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:28,052
Is everything prepped for the shoots?

330
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,830
Of course. Don't worry, we're good.

331
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,464
By the way, there won't be any
changes made to your budget.

332
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:35,464
Really?

333
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,208
I went to great lengths for that.

334
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,047
So don't worry, and keep rolling.

335
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,221
Thanks. What a surprise.

336
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:44,766
Fancy a drink tonight?

337
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:45,926
Why?

338
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,638
You promised if I secured the funds.

339
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,714
You know I'm swamped.

340
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,123
Is it because of Ko Sang Sik?

341
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,211
I heard he's lately busy with
audit investigations.

342
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,302
Did you know that?

343
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,427
Is it about that article?

344
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,632
Yes, you're the reason.

345
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,645
No way.

346
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:10,662
You had the press event on the ferry.

347
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:11,775
What's the big deal?

348
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,741
He seems to be under fire for it.

349
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:18,616
He might even go public about
your relationship.

350
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,919
If you know what's right for him,

351
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,313
you should break it off.

352
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,807
Why on Earth did you do that?

353
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,351
Why? It's obvious.

354
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:35,325
But you're in the middle
of this scandal with me.

355
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,930
- Chief Ko.
- Yes?

356
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,491
I'm grateful you stepped up
about the drama selection.

357
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,714
I didn't do it for your gratitude.

358
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:48,121
But this is the thing.

359
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,370
With the press event on the ferry
and filming permission,

360
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,954
people are going to suspect
that you did it for me.

361
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:57,154
How else can I prove my innocence?

362
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,475
You shouldn't have told them
about our relationship.

363
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,387
Why would I lie about that?

364
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:03,631
Goodness.

365
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:06,965
You and your staunch rules.

366
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,373
We live next door to each other.

367
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,487
That comes out if they search our address.

368
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,349
They could frame me that way.

369
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,845
Maybe you should drop the ferry project.

370
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,525
If we sell the ferry now,

371
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:24,020
the collusion on bids, shoddy repairs,
and all that get covered up.

372
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,566
That's why Director Shin wants it gone.

373
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,475
But Woori City needs that ferry.

374
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,531
Why aren't they investigating
Director Shin instead?

375
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:39,712
It feels reassuring
to have you on my side.

376
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,934
The least I could do for you...

377
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,038
is slash the drama budget.

378
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,637
Why would you do that?

379
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,454
Your team worked hard to pull it off.

380
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:51,863
But there is no other way.

381
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,383
Life doesn't have clear answers.

382
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,352
I hate that you're doubted like this.

383
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:57,984
- Why?
- What do you think?

384
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:01,012
I know you're not a bad person
and that none of it is true.

385
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:04,517
Is that your only reason?

386
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,503
Because I have feelings for you.

387
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,526
Are you satisfied with that?

388
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:29,116
Then what happens to Chief Ko?

389
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:31,549
He might become the scapegoat.

390
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,142
It could even cost our whole team.

391
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,678
That's terrible.

392
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,740
Ms. Han, why aren't you eating?

393
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,031
Is something bothering you?

394
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,394
Yes.

395
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:45,979
What's the matter?

396
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,815
It's probably because of Chief Ko.

397
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,751
But they are indeed dating.

398
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,896
- Dating Producer Gang?
- Yes.

399
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,704
I shouldn't have hit the movies with him.

400
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,115
You watched a movie together?

401
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,767
But for what?

402
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,026
He turned me down that day.

403
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,649
I shouldn't have pressured him.

404
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:12,916
I regret not holding back then.

405
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:26,808
What's that?

406
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,081
We're going to live apart.

407
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:35,392
Live apart? What about Hun?

408
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:38,741
He's with his dad. That traitor.

409
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,556
Of course, it's his home.

410
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,624
You better get back.

411
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:45,626
What? Wait!

412
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:46,804
Ko Sang Hee!

413
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:49,626
Jun Woo, why are you doing this?

414
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:51,228
It's not what you think.

415
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:54,233
What? What's wrong now?

416
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:58,502
He's thinking about moving out.

417
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,983
- Look.
- What?

418
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:02,338
He's been searching for a place.

419
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,549
- Why?
- What do you think? For you.

420
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:09,490
So you're not troubled but happy.

421
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,546
Talk about overreacting.

422
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:13,290
No, it's not like that.

423
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,892
What do you mean it's not?

424
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:16,668
Is something wrong?

425
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,668
You're back late.

426
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,893
There now, you keep quiet.

427
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,669
What's wrong, Mi Rye?

428
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:31,898
Darn it.

429
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,496
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

430
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,424
Are you sure about that?

431
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:41,232
Of course.

432
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,656
Why are you so late? You had dinner?

433
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,544
Yes, it was delicious.

434
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:46,951
That's good.

435
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,637
I need to talk to Jun Woo.

436
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,180
Sure, go ahead.

437
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
All right.

438
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:57,989
What's going on?

439
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,843
How can he only think about himself?

440
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,348
I'm not even his concern.

441
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:15,363
Are you really going to behave like this?

442
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:19,784
You see, I'm honestly fine with it.

443
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:24,350
Then what's the problem?

444
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,854
What did you tell me when you
returned from Canada?

445
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,500
When my appendix burst,

446
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,181
what did you tell me at the hospital?

447
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:37,466
And after my wife's funeral,

448
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:39,316
what did you tell me in the car?

449
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,396
I remember.

450
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:45,346
You vowed to become our family...

451
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:48,006
and that nothing could take you
away from us, remember?

452
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,291
Can't you see that I'll be hurt
without you here?

453
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,803
But leaving is the best for you.

454
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:58,934
Don't say that.

455
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,709
All right, Sang Sik.

456
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,475
I wasn't thinking it through.

457
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,693
I did look for a place,

458
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:13,651
but I can't give up your family.

459
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:19,028
So bear with me even if it gets tough.

460
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:22,405
I'll be here to wish you happiness.

461
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,523
Okay.

462
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:27,124
Now that's more like that.

463
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:31,217
Goodness, you guys are so stubborn.

464
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:33,395
I've had it with this family.

465
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,427
Cheers.

466
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,760
Look.

467
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:11,833
What?

468
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,525
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

469
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,294
But after seeing you,

470
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:18,519
it's all coming back to haunt me.

471
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,446
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,229
Why don't we have breakfast together?

473
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:25,770
No, I'm having breakfast with my son.

474
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,439
I see.

475
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,689
I'll see you later.

476
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,497
Hello, Tae Yeon.

477
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,273
Did you hear it from Ae Gyeong?

478
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,367
What? Today?

479
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,912
You're going to meet him?

480
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:57,159
I deeply apologize for what happened.

481
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,944
So don't ever meet her again
or come around anymore?

482
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:02,646
Is that your point?

483
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:05,071
No, you're Min Ju's friend.

484
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,528
I'm only asking you to wait
before visiting again.

485
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:11,640
Do you still see me as a homewrecker?

486
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,423
No, don't get me wrong.

487
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,262
My brother-in-law is to blame.

488
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,649
Right, you didn't know anything.

489
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,335
Fine.

490
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:23,721
As a friend who wishes her well,
I have something to say.

491
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:28,327
Min Ju has managed fine by herself.

492
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:31,017
But because of me,

493
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,161
I'm worried about how you see her.

494
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:36,676
Treat her well despite what happened.

495
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:39,884
Of course. Thank you.

496
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:44,762
And I appreciate you telling me
where her stuff was stored.

497
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,487
No worries.

498
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:49,262
Make sure she doesn't run away again...

499
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:51,074
by showering her with love.

500
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,816
All right.

501
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:32,120
You wouldn't get it, since
you never married.

502
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:38,287
Maybe it's just a phase,

503
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:41,293
but spending time with Ae Gyeong...

504
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:42,583
meant a lot to me.

505
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:46,126
Even if that's the case,

506
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:51,850
if it made your wife uneasy and upset,

507
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,502
you shouldn't have.

508
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,064
Don't you produce dramas?

509
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:00,000
You should get how people feel.

510
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,952
Well, I guess.

511
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:03,473
But this is reality.

512
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:09,154
Plus, it involves my close friend.

513
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:11,962
I know it's because of Sang Sik...

514
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:14,609
since it would get awkward.

515
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:20,863
I can't say that's not entirely true.

516
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:24,522
And I've grown fond of Sang Hee.

517
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:25,624
I know.

518
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:29,987
But my feelings are purely innocent.

519
00:29:31,194 --> 00:29:33,690
I really click with Ae Gyeong,

520
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,580
and she's comfortable like a friend.

521
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:39,892
I can see that.

522
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,178
However,

523
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,442
love also requires devotion.

524
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:47,995
Devotion?

525
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:52,491
Though being devoted without love
would feel empty.

526
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,592
To stay devoted,

527
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,554
you need a whole lot of love.

528
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,437
Right.

529
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,902
So you know that.

530
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,061
All right.

531
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,726
I'll make an effort.

532
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,075
Don't you have a better location?

533
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:28,108
We need the car to crash and spin,

534
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,419
but it's too narrow here.

535
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,868
This is more than enough.

536
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:33,611
How epic are you trying to make it?

537
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:36,606
Come on, it's a drama for Woori City.

538
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,539
Boss.

539
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,646
- Haven't you started rolling?
- No.

540
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:45,328
I don't like what we rehearsed here.

541
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:48,249
- Hello.
- Hello, thanks for the help.

542
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,288
Last time, Producer Nam...

543
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:53,159
decided on these filming locations.

544
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,040
But he didn't like the last spot...

545
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,771
and is still fussing after coming here.

546
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,840
There you are.

547
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,592
- Hello.
- This is killing me.

548
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:06,964
Producer Gang, can't you take over?

549
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,964
When are we going to roll?

550
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:11,548
Call us when you're set.

551
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,627
I've been here since early morning.

552
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,268
It's because this is our first shoot.

553
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,236
Think of it as finding our rhythm.

554
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:18,774
Producer Nam, I need a word.

555
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:24,142
I told you to find that rhythm
with the camera rolling.

556
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,328
Why are you apologizing? Just handle it.

558
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:35,593
And if you don't like this spot
I'll take another look.

559
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,035
- Really?
- It's what I can do for you.

560
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:43,843
And don't try to make it perfect.

561
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:44,970
How could I not?

562
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,411
There was a cutthroat competition
to make this drama.

563
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,810
So many eyes are on it.

564
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,286
Plus, it's my directorial debut.

565
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,019
So take a breather and don't push it.

566
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:00,204
Okay, I'll ask for your help
when it gets too hard.

567
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:02,041
I hope it doesn't come to that.

568
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:06,521
And wrap it up for today.

569
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,664
- What?
- With how things stand,

570
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,688
you won't be getting shots you like.

571
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:15,200
You're the captain steering this ship.

572
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,232
Soon enough, there won't be
any guide like me.

573
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:22,817
You need to decide and stand by it.

574
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,872
So clear your head, and when you're ready,

575
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:27,359
kick it off from there.

576
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,474
All right.

577
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,440
I appreciate it, Boss.

578
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,584
This isn't easy.

579
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:40,142
What?

580
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:42,062
Do they need new filming locations?

581
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,791
He is over the top with everything.

582
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,274
- Who?
- Producer Nam, the director.

583
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:51,169
Even Producer Gang came to check
because of the delay.

584
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,360
Is that right?

585
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,905
These are the locations that
Producer Nam picked.

586
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:59,180
We'll need to redo the schedule
once they are finalized.

587
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,292
Okay, I'll take a look.

588
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,292
All right.

589
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:12,621
What's this?

590
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:13,865
You can see it yourself.

591
00:33:16,716 --> 00:33:17,807
Why are you taking that?

592
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:26,356
My goodness.

593
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:48,555
This is our festival period,
so revisit and promote the event.

594
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:49,555
- All right.
- Okay.

595
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,129
Hello.

596
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,666
We were wondering if we go inside,
what is there to see?

597
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,110
Yes.

598
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,270
So this guy is a Korean philosopher...

599
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,219
named Yi I, also known as Yulgok.

600
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:07,222
He is the Korean equivalent
of Socrates and Confucius.

601
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:11,501
So here, we are celebrating
his life and achievements.

602
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,918
Thanks, we'll make sure to have a look.

603
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,918
Thank you.

604
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,791
Min Ji Seon.

605
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,166
Hello, Jun.

606
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,382
Are you doing well?

607
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:22,421
Of course. Did you get what I asked?

608
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:23,421
Yes.

609
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:25,749
Here.

610
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,364
Have you developed this healthy meal plan?

611
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:32,900
I got everything down by hand,

612
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,804
so make sure you stick to it.

613
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:38,049
Of course. I'll follow it strictly.

614
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:39,858
It's a gift for our city ambassador.

615
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:43,780
I'm done here. Do you want to eat out?

616
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,538
- Let's go.
- Okay.

617
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:51,959
I'm here, Ms. Ko.

618
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

619
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,712
You can sit here.

620
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:57,712
Thank you.

621
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:02,296
How is the filming going?

622
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:04,242
Well, you see...

623
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:07,377
Is there a problem with the script?

624
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:09,161
No.

625
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:12,016
I'm stuck after setting the bar too high.

626
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,762
So I wrapped up the shoot today
and came to see you.

627
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,615
Why me?

628
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,847
While going through the script,

629
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:21,908
there were lines that struck a chord.

630
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:23,323
Which one?

631
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:26,636
"Life hinges on believing in yourself."

632
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:28,107
"Without that belief,"

633
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:30,555
"you wander aimlessly and get lost."

634
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,859
It went something like that.

635
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,117
That line?

636
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:36,621
That made me think of you.

637
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:39,996
Are you thirsty?

638
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,245
Should we get something?

639
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:46,102
Ko Mi Rye.

640
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:48,277
Jun Woo.

641
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:54,866
Are you on a date with Mi Rye?

642
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,124
Yes, you can say it is.

643
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:01,858
It's not a date, it's work-related.

644
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,746
Work stress is what brought me here,

645
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,108
but I'm not here for work.

646
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:10,677
You two look great together.

647
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:13,333
Honestly, you are the couple
with the best appearances.

648
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,397
Perfect height and chemistry.

649
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:16,871
You beat everybody.

650
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:19,808
She's like my sister.

651
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,100
I'm stuffed.

652
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,182
How did you like the food?

653
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:29,239
It was delicious.

654
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:32,413
I'll go, so you get back.

655
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:33,909
If I didn't have work tomorrow,

656
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,173
we could have grabbed a drink.

657
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:37,438
Really?

658
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:39,025
That's a bummer.

659
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,152
Jun.

660
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,975
Thanks for this. I'll use it well.

661
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:44,975
Okay.

662
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,734
Mi Rye, I'll see you around.

663
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:48,168
Yes, bye.

664
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:52,854
Take care.

665
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,558
I'll go, so you can chat more.

666
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,021
No, that's okay.

667
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:01,038
If you have questions about
the script, call me.

668
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:02,072
Okay.

669
00:37:02,669 --> 00:37:06,431
Do you really live in the same house?

670
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:07,896
- Yes.
- Yes.

671
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:11,364
I trust you, okay?

672
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:12,389
I'll get going.

673
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:14,955
- Bye.
- Bye.

674
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,554
- Let's go.
- Okay.

675
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:23,901
Why didn't you stay behind when
he seemed eager to talk?

676
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:26,087
Why didn't you go with Min Ji Seon?

677
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:31,789
What was that earlier?

678
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,829
It looked like a notebook.

679
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:36,068
Well, just recipes.

680
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,203
It's like a healthy meal plan.

681
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:40,428
Why? Since she models for our city?

682
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,166
I just felt sorry.

683
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,727
Look, you're just leading her on.

684
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:49,254
Come on.

685
00:37:49,254 --> 00:37:53,373
You should see how things go
with Producer Nam.

686
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,981
Forget it.

687
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,793
Why? Are you embarrassed?

688
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:01,576
It's not an embarrassing thing
to like someone.

689
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,245
But after confessing your feelings,

690
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,526
if things start to get awkward...

691
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,618
or even turn sour, what will you do?

692
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,570
I don't know.

693
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:24,536
Do you want to go and read
some comic books?

694
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:27,025
The comics cafe?

695
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:30,111
Isn't it nice being back?

696
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:32,624
Yes, it sure feels different.

697
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,824
I prefer this nostalgic place
over the sleek ones.

698
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,239
True.

699
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,500
We used to come here a lot.

700
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,096
And when I cried over a story,

701
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:45,720
you stayed with me to read
until it became dark.

702
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Yes.

703
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,771
Why did you want to come here?

704
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:51,476
I just missed those times.

705
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,331
It seems you're growing old.

706
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,940
I'm a mature woman now.

707
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:00,109
I'll read the first one.

708
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:10,859
I need book four.

709
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,406
What's taking you so long?

710
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,112
This looks like you.

711
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:51,079
What a handsome face.

712
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:06,999
What are you doing?

713
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,004
Mosquito!

714
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,202
Mosquito!

715
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:12,301
The darn mosquito.

716
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,048
Are you kidding me?

717
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:16,429
My goodness. And then?

718
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,893
I said she was crossing the line.

719
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:21,732
Even if Mr. Ko helped her move back,

720
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:24,547
how could she side with his family?

721
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,453
They have been through a lot,
so cut her some slack.

722
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:29,038
Hello!

723
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,667
What's with this mood?
Were you talking about me?

724
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,433
Yes.

725
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:40,515
We were discussing love versus friendship.

726
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,785
I'm sorry about that.

727
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:49,160
I should have heard you out
on how you met him...

728
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,641
and took your perspective on it.

729
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,368
It's too late now.

730
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,597
For someone who's been through
marriage and divorce,

731
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:58,106
that was quite an oversight.

732
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,435
- What comes next?
- What?

733
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:05,036
Aren't you going to take it up
a notch with him?

734
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,708
What do you mean?

735
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,883
You could move in together...

736
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,060
or even tear down the separating wall.

737
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,506
Or what about a wedding?

738
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:14,901
I don't know.

739
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:16,615
Haven't you even thought about it?

740
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,965
I like how things are now.

741
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,773
Good grief, I'm jealous.

742
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,199
You are living my dream.

743
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:28,669
If they tie the knot,

744
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:30,405
how would you face his family?

745
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,527
Why? Because of Richard?

746
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:34,702
It's not like they live in his house.

747
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,358
After what went down with you,

748
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,246
his wife moved back with her things.

749
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,344
Really?

750
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,213
Then Richard must be alone.

751
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:47,000
Why? Are you going to call him?

752
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:49,752
No.

753
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,556
Goodness me.

754
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:57,946
Welcome to our end-of-life experience.

755
00:41:57,946 --> 00:42:00,564
This helps you embrace life...

756
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:02,123
Seriously?

757
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:05,545
Isn't this a bit too much?

758
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:10,206
As you lie dead for ten minutes,

759
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:13,963
you will be able to reflect on
your mistakes and life.

760
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:16,532
What's this?

761
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:17,556
It's your will.

762
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:18,556
What?

763
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:21,436
Sang Sik.

764
00:42:21,436 --> 00:42:22,790
Write it.

765
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:28,532
Why would I write a will?

766
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:30,663
Now, please lie down in the coffin.

767
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,454
I can't believe this.

768
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:38,843
Sang Sik.

769
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,070
Get inside.

770
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:53,646
What are we even doing?

771
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,319
Lie down inside.

772
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:01,686
This is crazy.

773
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:05,754
I can't believe this.

774
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:08,404
What are we even doing here?

775
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,167
How does it feel?

776
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:14,877
I'm sorry.

777
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:18,146
You don't need to apologize to me.

778
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:22,084
I'll only think of my wife...

779
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:25,097
and cherish my life with her.

780
00:43:25,097 --> 00:43:26,794
But you can't even talk to her.

781
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,811
I'll make more effort.

782
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:33,736
And I'll speak to her more.

783
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,008
I'll say it again if she doesn't get it.

784
00:43:37,008 --> 00:43:39,508
I'll explain until she does.

785
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:41,263
Now, we'll close the lid.

786
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,253
Excuse me?

787
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:48,086
Why would you close the lid? Sang Sik.

788
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,846
Stop talking if you're dead.

789
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:52,568
Let's pass away in peace.

790
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,016
Sang Sik.

791
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:57,344
Wait a minute.

792
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,193
This isn't right.

793
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,810
Sang Sik.

794
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:07,280
I won't bend over backward anymore.

795
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,465
I pinched pennies all year long, but what?

796
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:13,698
Scrimping wears you down?

797
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:24,999
I'd like to buy all this.

798
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,066
Okay.

799
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,433
How was your afterlife?

800
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,585
Life is so unfair.

801
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:46,448
So many thoughts crossed my mind.

802
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:49,297
I regretted living this way.

803
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:52,367
That's good.

804
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:55,158
Life is too precious to be abandoned.

805
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,824
Sang Sik.

806
00:45:00,717 --> 00:45:02,167
What are you doing? Get up.

807
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:06,726
No, I'll just stay here.

808
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:08,060
What?

809
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,324
I'll stay inside the coffin.

810
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,220
You can bury me alive.

811
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,470
Goodness.

812
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,529
Get up already.

813
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:19,248
Just leave me here to die.

814
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:22,140
That's enough. Get up now.

815
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:26,436
Goodness.

816
00:45:27,322 --> 00:45:28,740
What did you write in the will?

817
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:31,314
You see...

818
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:36,210
Though I might not be
the best provider as a husband,

819
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,410
I thanked my wife for her
trust and support.

820
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:43,639
What about you?

821
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:44,929
Me?

822
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:47,097
Well, I wished for my family...

823
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:49,193
to be trouble-free and healthy.

824
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:52,964
That's not a will, but your personal wish.

825
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:55,163
Let's go now.

826
00:45:56,568 --> 00:45:57,579
Okay.

827
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:04,888
When is the top chefs' party again?

828
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:07,545
This weekend. Why?

829
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:08,858
Just curious.

830
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:14,225
There must be pretty lady chefs.

831
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:16,761
There are a few.

832
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:18,281
Really?

833
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:20,763
Why? Do you want to come?

834
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:22,407
No, why would I go there?

835
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:26,211
Don't worry, it's not a couple's thing.

836
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:29,160
We're having a casual dinner with friends.

837
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Really?

838
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:32,775
Then maybe I should go.

839
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:33,809
Sure.

840
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,082
Is Ji Seon going to be there?

841
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:40,825
Why on Earth would she come?

842
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:43,130
You also know her well.

843
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,701
Who could be a better friend than you?

844
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,452
That's good to know.

845
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:50,239
What?

846
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,322
Never mind.

847
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:57,384
This is too heavy.

848
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:58,411
Give it here.

849
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,474
Do you want to return all of them?

850
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:14,842
If that's a problem,

851
00:47:14,842 --> 00:47:16,809
I'll just exchange them.

852
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:18,477
Okay, sure.

853
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:34,628
Sang Hee.

854
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,809
Why are you so surprised?

855
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,182
It's nothing.

856
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,447
Whose clothes are you buying?

857
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:46,574
I came to shop for my son,

858
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:49,217
but these were also on sale.

859
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:51,314
What brings you here?

860
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:53,275
Well, I'm here for groceries.

861
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:54,429
I see.

862
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:57,126
Should I return this scarf?

863
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,465
Yes, I'm sorry.

864
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:02,465
Okay.

865
00:48:06,682 --> 00:48:08,442
You haven't even patched things up...

866
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,521
but returned your things for him?

867
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:15,540
There are also a few for my son.

868
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:18,803
That's what married life is.

869
00:48:18,803 --> 00:48:21,793
It's a waste to buy stuff for me.

870
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:24,434
I don't even have a job.

871
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,658
There are excellent homemakers out there,

872
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:29,545
but I'm not like that.

873
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:32,632
But you're doing a fantastic job.

874
00:48:32,632 --> 00:48:34,785
You're just saying that.

875
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:37,961
I could tell by Chief Ko's kimchi
and soybean paste.

876
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:41,544
How did you know that I made them?

877
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:42,741
Exactly.

878
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,594
Also,

879
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:48,620
my friend told me everything.

880
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,714
She assured me that nothing happened.

881
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:59,612
Your husband probably saw her
as a fleeting detour.

882
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:01,284
Detour?

883
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,274
I wouldn't mind having that
just once in my life.

884
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:08,986
Since your friend was never married,

885
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:11,454
maybe she doesn't get how much it hurts.

886
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:16,198
My friend got married
and then got divorced.

887
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:20,868
Then she should have known better.

888
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:23,004
She had no idea.

889
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:24,078
Please believe that.

890
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:27,270
I know, so I blame my husband.

891
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,262
Goodness.

892
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,053
What? I didn't buy this.

893
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:41,199
Where is the receipt?

894
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:44,591
It's not here.

895
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:49,428
And when you're shopping for your family,

896
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,638
don't forget to treat yourself.

897
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:54,399
You could at least buy a scarf.

898
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,039
Thanks for the thought.

899
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:04,952
What are you doing?

900
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:06,499
It's nothing.

901
00:50:07,026 --> 00:50:08,195
What's all this?

902
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:13,324
Did you shop for your husband?

903
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:15,155
Well, you see...

904
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:16,995
Why did you even leave your house?

905
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:18,403
Get yourself back.

906
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:21,187
Sang Sik, this here...

907
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:22,188
What about it?

908
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:25,106
I picked it out at the store,

909
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,732
but couldn't buy it.

910
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,938
Then, the next-door lady got it...

911
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:32,083
and sneaked it into my bag.

912
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,083
Really?

913
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:36,135
It's a small gesture, but I love it.

914
00:50:36,135 --> 00:50:37,750
Why can't my husband do that?

915
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,655
So why would you even buy
this stuff for him?

916
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,832
You know me.

917
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:44,614
I'll throw them out for you.

918
00:50:44,614 --> 00:50:47,559
No, I spent a fortune.

919
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:49,918
Head back if you're going to forgive.

920
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:51,537
And stop buying his stuff.

921
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,570
This is good.

922
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,487
Right? It's nostalgic.

923
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:14,816
It's nice getting out like this.

924
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:19,022
Being young isn't everything.

925
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:23,293
You're still figuring it out until 40.

926
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:27,739
Then you really start living after 50.

927
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:29,763
But aren't matching clothes too much?

928
00:51:29,763 --> 00:51:31,491
What?

929
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,923
We're off to get our promise rings.

930
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,673
- Really?
- Yes.

931
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:40,943
The city hall audit is stressing you out.

932
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:43,007
I know.

933
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:46,271
It's not right to penalize Chief Ko.

934
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,726
Even after coming here,

935
00:51:48,726 --> 00:51:51,311
I still have these concerns.

936
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:55,700
How about you quit work...

937
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,647
and travel the world by my side?

938
00:51:59,647 --> 00:52:01,600
Don't tempt me.

939
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,176
I still have dreams and ambitions.

940
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:06,248
Is it work or me?

941
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,163
Pick just one.

942
00:52:09,408 --> 00:52:11,728
I choose myself.

943
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,076
What?

944
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:15,497
Aren't you the Deputy Mayor?

945
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:16,530
My word.

946
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,144
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

947
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:20,896
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

948
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:28,510
How could you drop my hand like that?

949
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,582
I have an image to uphold.

950
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:32,296
Forget about the promise rings.

951
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,298
Don't be like that, Dokgo Bong.

952
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:36,890
Please.

953
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:44,783
Let's go.

954
00:52:44,783 --> 00:52:47,250
Pick out what speaks to you.

955
00:52:57,576 --> 00:53:00,560
Don't you need to reschedule
for the filming and stuff?

956
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,584
Yes.

957
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,599
My goodness, it's instant noodles.

958
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,535
I was just going to make some.

959
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:07,968
It's my seafood specialty.

960
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:09,314
Turn off the stove and eat.

961
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:16,199
You were craving some after
your heavy lunch.

962
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,422
Eat up.

963
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,093
But what if your family sees?

964
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:22,716
So what?

965
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:23,838
Just enjoy.

966
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,092
It looks amazing.

967
00:53:26,843 --> 00:53:29,173
It's me, Ye Ji.

968
00:53:38,602 --> 00:53:39,716
Wait up.

969
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,131
I have something to tell you.

970
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:46,087
Sure, sit here.

971
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:47,712
Were you going to eat?

972
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:48,830
Do you want some?

973
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,071
No, I'm on a diet.

974
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:53,710
I made some to eat right now,

975
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,089
but I'm not craving it.

976
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:00,207
What's it about?

977
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:03,407
I thought about asking my dad,

978
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:06,271
but it's easier with you.

979
00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:08,206
Here.

980
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:11,331
(Collusion suspected between
Chief A and SBC Producer)

981
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,535
This article?

982
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,941
I believe my dad more than the news.

983
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:19,526
Well, of course.

984
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:23,295
But I'm curious about your relationship.

985
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:25,930
Well...

986
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:28,064
You see...

987
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:32,768
I'm glad that you moved back here,

988
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:35,112
but don't be burdened by me.

989
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,990
Burdened?

990
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,104
I could live with my aunts.

991
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:42,528
So if you want to live with him,

992
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:45,752
please don't hesitate because of me.

993
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:47,802
I just wanted you to know that.

994
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,184
What made you think that?

995
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:57,688
You moved out but came back.

996
00:54:57,688 --> 00:55:00,066
That means you grew closer.

997
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,863
That's true, but don't worry.

998
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:06,051
We can still be friendly neighbors.

999
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:07,143
Really?

1000
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:09,156
What?

1001
00:55:09,156 --> 00:55:11,558
So, things haven't moved forward?

1002
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,286
I can't believe my dad.

1003
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:14,502
What?

1004
00:55:14,502 --> 00:55:18,130
Anyway, you get what I mean?

1005
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:22,147
Yes, thanks for looking out for me.

1006
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:26,209
Then I'll get going.

1007
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:29,025
All right, sleep well.

1008
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,068
Night.

1009
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,084
That's something on my mind.

1010
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:49,459
Ye Ji is a good kid.

1011
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:53,921
The instant noodles must be all soggy now.

1012
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,506
I'll whip up a new batch.

1013
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,515
I can't wait.

1014
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:09,387
No date today?

1015
00:56:10,256 --> 00:56:13,930
No, and I kind of missed you.

1016
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,075
What?

1017
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:19,121
How about we eat something else?

1018
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:20,121
Why?

1019
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:24,028
You remember that dentist I met
on a blind date?

1020
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:25,028
Yes.

1021
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:28,863
She always had steak, pasta,
and stuff like that.

1022
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:30,888
So it's starting to sit heavy.

1023
00:56:32,343 --> 00:56:33,847
What would you like to have?

1024
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:36,511
With chopped pork boiled hot,

1025
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:38,896
spicy kimchi stew and soju.

1026
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,007
What?

1027
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:45,211
You're all gourmet meal with her,
but rustic meal with me?

1028
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:49,592
That's what it seems like.

1029
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:51,613
Don't you want to?

1030
00:56:51,613 --> 00:56:53,452
- Let's go.
- What?

1031
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,367
I know where to get kimchi stew.

1032
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:58,492
You have some good sense.

1033
00:56:58,492 --> 00:57:00,325
It's on me today.

1034
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:02,138
So classy.

1035
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:12,464
All right.

1036
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:14,973
Just leave it.

1037
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,759
It gets done faster with two.

1038
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:20,023
How were the instant noodles?

1039
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:22,799
The noodles were good, but...

1040
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:25,880
Were they salty?

1041
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:29,415
They weren't as good as
my seafood instant noodles.

1042
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,191
Just give it here.

1043
00:57:33,852 --> 00:57:36,895
But I haven't finished soaping it.

1044
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:38,344
Come on, let's do it together.

1045
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:39,760
I'll do it.

1046
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,242
Why are you upset now?

1047
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,562
It was good.

1048
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:45,578
You can make it yourself.

1049
00:57:45,578 --> 00:57:49,867
But adding some squid
would make it better.

1050
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,532
Along with the years,

1051
00:57:51,532 --> 00:57:54,404
I've realized that daily comforts...

1052
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,638
bring more joy than fleeting sparks.

1053
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:01,096
All right, let's get to work.

1054
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:05,088
We initially chose this location,

1055
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:07,002
but what if we switch to here?

1056
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,327
That's a good idea.

1057
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:10,989
Would it be possible?

1058
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,187
I'll have to ask the locals,
but it could work.

1059
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:18,864
And this is where we wanted
the wedding scene,

1060
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:20,355
but are there other suggestions?

1061
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:23,275
How about this spot?

1062
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:27,680
You don't understand women.
It's too plain here.

1063
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:30,725
What about the outdoors?

1064
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:33,160
I know a place that could work.

1065
00:58:36,494 --> 00:58:37,512
How about here?

1066
00:58:38,509 --> 00:58:39,960
It's really nice.

1067
00:58:42,918 --> 00:58:45,383
You want to have a wedding here?

1068
00:58:47,254 --> 00:58:50,032
What are you saying? Anything else?

1069
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,894
Along with the years,

1070
00:58:55,894 --> 00:59:00,190
I've realized how it's a great blessing...

1071
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,543
to share your life with someone.

1072
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:15,076
(Woori City Hall)

1073
00:59:18,213 --> 00:59:19,383
Where is Ms. Han?

1074
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:23,279
What? What's the matter?

1075
00:59:23,805 --> 00:59:25,480
Look at your desk.

1076
00:59:31,073 --> 00:59:32,269
What's this?

1077
00:59:35,147 --> 00:59:36,821
Goodness.

1078
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:44,019
Did you want to see me?

1079
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,985
I heard you went to the provincial office.

1080
00:59:52,985 --> 00:59:54,390
Is something the matter?

1081
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:57,279
Regarding the ferry issue,

1082
00:59:57,279 --> 00:59:59,969
they want it settled before it
escalates to the media.

1083
01:00:01,158 --> 01:00:05,382
I submitted the questionable
repair documents...

1084
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,375
that you gave me before,

1085
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,601
but before the issue grows worse,

1086
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:11,540
they want it over with now.

1087
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,213
What do you mean?

1088
01:00:14,213 --> 01:00:17,342
Didn't the audit raise any red flags?

1089
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,003
Deep-rooted corruption...

1090
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:24,620
hits the city and the government harder.

1091
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,891
And since you managed the recent repairs,

1092
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,591
they want you to take the fall.

1093
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:32,483
They had conveniently pointed
to the hailstorm damages...

1094
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:34,124
when you stepped up...

1095
01:00:34,124 --> 01:00:37,171
to save everyone without any casualties.

1096
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,742
And now you're held accountable.

1097
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:41,586
As for the press event on the ferry,

1098
01:00:41,586 --> 01:00:44,444
it wasn't some favor for Producer Gang,

1099
01:00:44,444 --> 01:00:48,196
but what promoted the development
of our city's cultural space.

1100
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:51,342
But they are pushing to make
you their scapegoat.

1101
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:07,188
Hey, Mi Rye.

1102
01:01:07,188 --> 01:01:09,171
What? Is there some news?

1103
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,563
You should read this.

1104
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:13,264
(Chief Ko demoted or expulsed
blamed for the ferry issue?)

1105
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,486
Isn't that Sang Sik?

1106
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:16,535
What are you doing?

1107
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:18,791
Sang Hee, look at this.

1108
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:19,953
What is it?

1109
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:23,511
Sang Sik?

1110
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:25,397
Boss.

1111
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,223
- What's the matter?
- Look here.

1112
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,040
(Chief Ko demoted or expulsed
blamed for the ferry issue?)

1113
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,247
What is this saying?

1114
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:34,732
Chief Ko is blamed for the ferry issue.

1115
01:01:35,578 --> 01:01:36,792
Demoted?

1116
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:39,793
Or expulsed?

1117
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:43,286
Look here.

1118
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:44,623
Even with all this?

1119
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:46,531
Why should I take the fall instead?

1120
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,939
Please investigate this further.

1121
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:53,204
You are being unjust.

1122
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:43,795
What happened?

1123
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,192
(Grade five Ko Sang Sik
demoted to grade six)

1124
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:55,492
Demoted?

1125
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:58,676
You got demoted?

1126
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:43,019
(Second to Last Love)

1127
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:46,633
If it weren't for her,
he wouldn't be in this mess.

1128
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:47,877
That's enough already!

1129
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:49,980
Don't you care about what I think?

1130
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,117
He's suspicious.

1131
01:03:51,117 --> 01:03:53,213
It seems that he knows something.

1132
01:03:53,213 --> 01:03:55,461
For once, I actually want to get married.

1133
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:57,097
- I...
- Don't say it.

1134
01:03:57,097 --> 01:03:58,936
That's what a guy should ask.

1135
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,690
You're not planning on sending Hun
to study abroad, are you?

1136
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,456
Can you blend in with my family?

1137
01:04:05,456 --> 01:04:06,963
Promise me you won't eat alone.

1138
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,870
