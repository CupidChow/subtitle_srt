1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,502
Can you hear me? Hello?

2
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,823
Hello?

3
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:27,661
Okay! Let's count down.

4
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,118
- Five.
- Five.

5
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:30,654
- Four.
- Four.

6
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:32,190
- Three.
- Three.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,606
- Two.
- Two.

8
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:34,922
- One!
- One!

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
What?

10
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,454
- What?
- For goodness' sake.

11
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:00,101
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,339
Are you okay?

13
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:17,576
Here is the opening couple!

14
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:18,745
Congratulations!

15
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,729
My goodness.

16
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:31,416
Congratulations!

17
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,829
- Come to the front.
- No.

18
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,865
- This way.
- Wait.

19
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,749
Ye Ji!

20
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,957
Are you okay?

21
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,979
What are we doing up here?

22
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,908
We're doing the opening show!

23
00:01:58,363 --> 00:01:59,780
What?

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
What's that?

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,162
Now for the opening dance!

26
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,932
Give it to us!

27
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:12,627
- Dance!
- Dance!

28
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,210
Let's get it over with.

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,063
Are you telling me to dance?

30
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,135
What else can we do?

31
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,178
Get a move on it.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,058
Like how?

33
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,870
Hurry, get me down!

34
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:57,739
Good grief.

35
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,978
That was a close call.

36
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,431
How come you weren't afraid?

37
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,543
What brings you here, anyway?

38
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,898
What about you?

39
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,649
Sang Sik. Min Ju.

40
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,964
Why are you even here?

41
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,812
One thing led to another.

42
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,586
My word.

43
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,660
Dad.

44
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,113
Ko Ye Ji!

45
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,787
Hi, I'm her friend, Kim Hyun Seok.

46
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,298
Come with me.

47
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,775
Let me go.

48
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,584
This is humiliating.

49
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,376
What did you say?

50
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,984
How did you even find me here?

51
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,272
Why aren't you at the English
tournament finals?

52
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:49,232
This was where I wanted to be,
not the final round.

53
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,739
Do you call that an excuse?

54
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,731
Just leave me alone!

55
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,052
You're breathing down my neck.

56
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,317
Can you even hear yourself?

57
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,892
Do you know why you're so
obsessed with me?

58
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,637
What? Obsessed?

59
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:02,420
You don't have a special lady.

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,548
With no one to shower your love,
energy, and attention,

61
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:09,053
you end up pestering me instead.

62
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,644
Dad, please live your own life...

63
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:12,981
and get off my back!

64
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:15,534
Stop right there.

65
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,128
- Come on, Sang Sik.
- Let go.

66
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,008
- That's enough.
- Let me go!

67
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,847
You should mind your own business.
This is a family matter.

68
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,061
Sang Sik.

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,869
You made me miss the concert.

70
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:26,869
Hi.

71
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,277
You are Ye Ji, right?

72
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:30,765
Move it.

73
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,728
You should first talk to your Dad.

74
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:36,198
I'm so over this.

75
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,430
Uncle, is she your girl?

76
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,433
What?

77
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,905
Get her out of here and shut her up.

78
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:43,945
What?

79
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,213
Look here, you...

80
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:52,257
There is nothing I can do.
Just have her forfeit the round.

81
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,265
But you tracked her down.

82
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,329
Try to get her to come around.

83
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,872
No use. Her mind is made up.

84
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,389
Don't I know my own daughter?

85
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:03,812
Okay, I'll have her pull out of the round,
all right?

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,612
All right.

87
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,277
My goodness.

88
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:16,307
(Second to Last Love)

89
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,591
(Episode 4)

90
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:22,137
Ye Ji, don't you have an English
tournament today?

91
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,653
- I gave up.
- Ko Ye Ji.

92
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,493
Wait! Didn't you buy a ticket before?

93
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,131
- Are they your friends?
- Yes, Dad.

94
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,357
Dad?

95
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,165
My word. Do you even come to concerts?

96
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,221
Bo Gyeong had something come up,

97
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,661
so he bought her ticket instead.

98
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:40,884
Really?

99
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,050
My Dad is a music buff.

100
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,672
He even has vinyl records at home.

101
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:49,934
Isn't that right?

102
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,264
Yes, sure.

103
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,239
You have the coolest Dad.

104
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,030
Mister, you're awesome.

105
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,694
- Why don't you buy some pizza?
- Why don't you buy some pizza?

106
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,738
Sure, let's get you some pizza.

107
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,341
- This looks delicious.
- This looks delicious.

108
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,518
Here you go.

109
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:08,687
Dad, have some.

110
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:11,036
I'm okay, you can enjoy it.

111
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,571
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

112
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,191
Thanks for the meal.

113
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,587
Which member do you think
is the best looking?

114
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,269
Tell me from your perspective.

115
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:23,770
My Dad isn't all that into it.

116
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,043
But he even came to the concert.

117
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,091
So he must know the members' names.

118
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,836
Actually, he came to catch...

119
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,900
Ye Ji.

120
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,444
Next time, I'll step up my game.

121
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,691
I'll even memorize their profiles.

122
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,923
Seriously?

123
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:41,285
What? The next concert is in Busan, right?

124
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,208
Are you going to travel all that way?

125
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,505
Yes, sure.

126
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:50,028
- Your Dad is the best.
- Your Dad is the best.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,393
Stop teasing me.

128
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:55,462
I wanted to dance well up there.

129
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:57,207
You were killing it.

130
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,553
You're the dancing queen
compared to Sang Sik.

131
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,486
I'm not all that, but he was...

132
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:06,314
Did you blow some stress, at least?

133
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,884
- Yes.
- See? It was a good trip.

134
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:15,326
Ye Ji is her name, right?

135
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,197
That girl has a hot temper.

136
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,268
But she turned out all right...

137
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:22,235
despite not having a mother
to care for her.

138
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,785
Where is her mother?

139
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:29,338
She passed away after giving birth.

140
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,885
We lost a good person.

141
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,221
Sang Sik really had it rough.

142
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:39,441
When did you two become friends?

143
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,601
Well, ever since we were kids.

144
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,819
After growing up here in my hometown,

145
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,876
I moved to Canada.

146
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,190
And is that where you studied?

147
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,199
Not really, but I traveled a lot.

148
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:56,926
Now tell me about you.

149
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,476
What about me?

150
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:02,087
Why aren't you married,
and still single at the moment?

151
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,711
Do you not like men?

152
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,515
I do like men.

153
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,657
But after reaching this age,

154
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,330
it's not easy to meet someone.

155
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,376
Because of your age?

156
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,297
The good ones are already married...

157
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,297
or taken by other women.

158
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:23,185
And I want to have
compatible conversations,

159
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,620
but it's hard to find someone who clicks.

160
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,466
I had a great time today.

161
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,963
Does that mean our date went well?

162
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,845
This would make people think
that I'm your aunt.

163
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:55,435
What about this?

164
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,396
Are you not digging it?

165
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,210
My word.

166
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:06,188
What about this? Do you like it?

167
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,983
You've seen too many dramas.

168
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:13,702
This is a documentary.

169
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,612
Flirting back and forth like young kids,

170
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,157
that's not my thing.

171
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:23,613
Let's make it official.

172
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,103
What?

173
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,217
What do you even like about me?

174
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:36,370
There is no reason when you're in love.

175
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,730
It's not about thinking and analyzing,

176
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,284
even if it doesn't add up.

177
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,675
Then you should do some thinking
and add things up.

178
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:46,770
I don't want to.

179
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,517
That's irrelevant to genuinely falling
for someone.

180
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,778
You're dead if you ditch
tournaments again.

181
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,346
Then I won't get caught.

182
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,291
How can you say that?

183
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,804
You haven't answered me.

184
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,200
Stop joking, and let's get back.

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,316
Good night.

186
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:15,868
Uncle, she is your girl, isn't she?

187
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,778
What were you doing out here?

188
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,218
I didn't do anything...

189
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,360
because you couldn't take a hint.

190
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,444
Good grief.

191
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,825
I watched the drama.

192
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:40,280
I told you to take responsibility,
not cause trouble.

193
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,584
Weren't you afraid to make that choice?

194
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,934
There was no choice when
tricks or talk failed.

195
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,336
So I played by the rules.

196
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:50,411
So are you paying the price
away from work?

197
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:59,166
- Kid, good night.
- Sweet dreams.

198
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,237
Sang Sik, I'm off to bed.

199
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,150
I told you not to drink from the bottle.

200
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,637
Just use the water purifier.

201
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,971
- Don't you have a girl?
- Stop that.

202
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:11,855
Take someone out while you still can.

203
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:14,431
I have to look after you when I still can.

204
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,855
I can't when I'm too old.

205
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,040
I can manage on my own.

206
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,160
Is that how you managed things like today?

207
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,746
I know you were hyped about
the English tournament,

208
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,608
but the student against me
always came in second.

209
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,665
Don't tell me you let her win.

210
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:31,495
She wanted it more than me.

211
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:34,330
That's why I felt defeated.

212
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,616
What?

213
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:39,231
I have other interests besides
English or studying.

214
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,475
It's a big world with lots of fun things.

215
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,827
What would you do for a living?

216
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,946
It's not about what you become,

217
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:48,143
but how you live your life.

218
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,388
For crying out loud.

219
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,628
I can take care of myself.

220
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,931
But you need a girl who can
take you to checkups.

221
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,323
That's enough from you.

222
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:00,125
I won't bother you when I'm old,

223
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,887
so knock it off and go to sleep.

224
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,900
You'd be lonely at my wedding
sitting all by yourself.

225
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,086
You rascal!

226
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:15,440
(Letter of Resignation, Gang Min Ju)

227
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:25,465
Let's see how much I need per month.

228
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:29,579
It's around 2,000 to 3,000 dollars.

229
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,924
After sending money to my parents...

230
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,972
In a year's time...

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,819
And the insurance benefits...

232
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:43,523
Is this everything?

233
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,707
I'll be broke in five years.

234
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:50,690
By then my age will be...

235
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:08,972
My word.

236
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,936
That was embarrassing.

237
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,088
Why are you bugging me this late?

238
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,879
I couldn't sleep.

239
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,701
Then you're still young.

240
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:39,835
By the way, why didn't you go
on the blind date?

241
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,326
How could you turn down my efforts?

242
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:46,644
What? You're here again.

243
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:48,422
I'm about to close now.

244
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,769
Really?

245
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,860
But your sign was still lit.

246
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,275
Why even come this late when
you don't drink much?

247
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:11,169
Did you patch things up with your kid?

248
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:15,366
No, she doesn't listen to me.

249
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,529
Why would she at her age?

250
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:21,765
Everyone is on their own.

251
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:26,782
You've never been married, have you?

252
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,856
Well, not yet.

253
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,733
You wouldn't know anything
if you're not a parent.

254
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,306
My daughter might be grown,
but she is just a kid.

255
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,043
She hasn't experienced the world.

256
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,777
Nagging will only make her
push back harder.

257
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:43,242
I was like that at my age.

258
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:45,699
Kids these days are a different breed.

259
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,574
You haven't even raised a kid
to know that.

260
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:49,935
That's such a boomer thing to say.

261
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,129
What?

262
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:57,113
Your daughter is just acting her age.

263
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,273
Why wouldn't she love concerts?

264
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:04,240
Missing that English tournament
won't change her life.

265
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,296
What are you even saying?

266
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,817
Do you think I'm some old geezer
obsessed with schooling?

267
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:13,932
But there are perks to getting older.

268
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,775
I now understand what I didn't before.

269
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,800
That feels nice.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,436
What we were clueless about
in our 20s and 30s.

271
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:31,443
But there are some things
you miss with age.

272
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,283
Don't get that on your sleeve.

273
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,823
Right, thanks.

274
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,358
Do you want to have a drink with me?

275
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,877
There isn't anyone else here,
and we'll leave soon.

276
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,663
Maybe just one drink, then.

277
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,134
This music is nice.

278
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:05,501
I'm still all about the music
from our time.

279
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:13,622
Now they are far away

280
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:17,997
Buried in memories

281
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:23,278
The stories we have shared

282
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,198
Remain in my heart

283
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,009
Once again

284
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,121
The smile in my memories

285
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:38,972
Are mine to have

286
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,851
Like the sunset glow

287
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:45,467
I love you

288
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:49,187
You're the only one in the world

289
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:52,131
I shout out your name

290
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:56,661
But the sunset burns without response

291
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,435
That's how it is.

292
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:09,281
These days, I can't even tell
the boy and girl idols apart.

293
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:12,882
Back in the day, we listened to
the Scorpians, Air Supply,

294
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,616
Pink Floyd, Bon Jovi,

295
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:18,496
and all those foreign bands.

296
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,256
Now it's hard to keep up.

297
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:24,743
That's why your daughter calls you old.

298
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,092
Dad jokes are all the rage these days.

299
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,428
Dad jokes?

300
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,334
Will this banana find me a-peeling?

301
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:41,111
Let's see now. This one.

302
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:48,894
Orange you glad for this orange?

303
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,828
What time is it in Indonesia?

304
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:54,712
Nesi is four...

305
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,479
Four o'clock.

306
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,785
What is "I don't know" in Japanese?

307
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,995
No Idea-Desune.

308
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,040
- And in Chinese?
- What?

309
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,464
That's it. No Idea-Zedong.

310
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,481
No Idea-Zedong?

311
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,078
What about in French?

312
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,847
No-Clue-Jour.

313
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:13,001
In German?

314
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,201
No-Idea-Dich.

315
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,120
What about in Ghanaian?

316
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,154
Ghanaian?

317
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:22,931
Not-Sure.

318
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,939
My word, you spit on me.

319
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,841
- Good grief.
- I'm sorry.

320
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,222
These old jokes still crack me up.

321
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:31,272
I know.

322
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,753
This is killing me.

323
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,717
I think we drank too much.

324
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,717
Exactly.

325
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,665
You know what?

326
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:49,534
I've never been this scared...

327
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:52,048
and uncertain about my future.

328
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:55,244
About your retirement?

329
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,895
Yes, about my retirement.

330
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:03,349
Making all those choices in life,

331
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,861
I felt a sense of pride for making them.

332
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,191
But there was also...

333
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:14,735
self-doubt from all the regret.

334
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,365
Just trust that your choices
were the right ones.

335
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:24,268
Or you'd be left with nothing.

336
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:25,916
Right.

337
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:34,054
You can take the check.

338
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:35,976
I should take it?

339
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:38,498
Civil servants don't make much.

340
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:40,567
You're the one rolling in dough.

341
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,975
I might lose my job now.

342
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,004
Are you okay?

343
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,664
Yes, I'm fine.

344
00:19:57,836 --> 00:19:58,855
My goodness.

345
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:08,018
You aren't giving me a piggyback ride,
are you?

346
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,154
Not-Sure.

347
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,779
You're too old to carry in my arms.

348
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,451
Too old? That's mature of you.

349
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,834
I can hold my drink, you know.

350
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:28,610
I never lost a drinking game
to the producer guys.

351
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,290
I always got home in one piece
and slept properly.

352
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,530
I'm sure you did.

353
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,594
But now you're getting old.

354
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:38,653
Old?

355
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,458
My mind feels stuck in my 30s...

356
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,227
and my heart is in my 20s.

357
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,383
How did I end up this old?

358
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,106
All this chatter in my ear
makes me ticklish.

359
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,328
Are we there yet?

360
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:00,692
Almost.

361
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,300
Then let me down.

362
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,583
And let's forget this happened, okay?

363
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,748
Heave-ho.

364
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,597
You had it tough on your own.

365
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:32,543
I struggle to even take care of myself.

366
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:40,350
What does she even know?

367
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:43,510
You must be lonely.

368
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,748
(Letter of Resignation, Gang Min Ju)

369
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,111
Don't do that.

370
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:44,670
You're the only one

371
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,481
All this chatter in my ear.

372
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:53,818
My word.

373
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:56,995
My goodness.

374
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,735
I can't believe I did that!

375
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,212
What's all this?

376
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,836
I tried cooking it, like you said.

377
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:27,943
Really?

378
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,375
It's too salty.

379
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:35,359
That's too bad.

380
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,213
It's important to soak the clams.

381
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,413
Seafood has a strong flavor.

382
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:49,079
And mind the order of ingredients
when you're adding them.

383
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,237
Give it a taste.

384
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,502
You made it tasty.

385
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,984
You are a good dancer,
but are lousy at cooking.

386
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,366
What did you say?

387
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:10,062
You see? I told you.

388
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:11,688
They are a thing.

389
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:13,733
Zucchini.

390
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,989
What's she doing here?

391
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,379
What? What's happening?

392
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,554
What's this? You're never up early.

393
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:26,251
I heard Jun Wo made seafood stew.

394
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:28,664
Park Jun Woo! What are you doing?

395
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,273
I'm hungry. Let's eat!

396
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,518
Why are you here this early?

397
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,936
I don't want to eat alone.

398
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,159
By the way, how is your face?

399
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,896
It's getting better.

400
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,089
What is she talking about?

401
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,303
What a load of drama.

402
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:54,462
Ye Ji wrecked her car,
Sang Hee gave her a rash,

403
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,013
and as for me...

404
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,640
We're out of control. I'm so hungry.

405
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,455
Come in if you're here.

406
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:11,517
You're all here having a meal.

407
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,421
It's a bit crowded. Sit here.

408
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,509
Okay.

409
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:15,937
Hello.

410
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:21,358
I'm glad your face looks better.

411
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,143
I had it pretty tough.

412
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,678
That's a sign of healing.

413
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:27,871
It was your body cleansing itself,
not a side effect.

414
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:31,035
Just eat your food.

415
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,035
Okay.

416
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:36,157
What's with the mood today?

417
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,226
If it's because of me...

418
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:39,670
What are you talking about?

419
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:43,038
You guys,
I have a big announcement to make.

420
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,067
This is Gang Min Ju, and her age...

421
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,906
- What are you doing?
- Forget that.

422
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:50,234
She is a drama producer at SBC.

423
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,466
For real? You make dramas?

424
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,978
That's astounding.

425
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,018
Ye Ji, I'll tell you more later.

426
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,626
What are you getting at?

427
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:58,879
Gang Min Ju...

428
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,943
We're dating now, starting today.

429
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:06,863
What did you just say?

430
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,397
I'd be grateful if you're kind, polite,

431
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:11,269
and respectful to my girlfriend.

432
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,334
Give a big hand.

433
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,063
Wait a minute.

434
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,125
What are you doing?

435
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,127
It's okay. What does it matter?

436
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:21,287
I'm not okay with it.

437
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,087
What's with this mood?

438
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:27,869
As you know, I'm Gang Min Ju,
who moved in next door.

439
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:31,308
I'm hoping we can get along,
despite everything.

440
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:32,368
I'm going now.

441
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:34,385
Min Ju.

442
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,668
Why are you in such a hurry
to date just anyone?

443
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,164
How could you say that?

444
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:47,715
Min Ju.

445
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,572
Min Ju.

446
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:54,061
Why would you do that?

447
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,820
You had no regard for me whatsoever.

448
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,077
It's because they're like family.

449
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,701
I'm sorry to make you upset.

450
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,117
Forget it.

451
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,677
I don't know what gave you the wrong idea,

452
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:05,695
but this is enough.

453
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:13,751
I am in a real pickle.

454
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,840
My word.

455
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:31,295
You there.

456
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:34,588
Me?

457
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,159
Who else is here?

458
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:38,988
What?

459
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:42,202
Watch it. There are people walking.

460
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,610
That's a bicycle lane.

461
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,002
Just keep to the sidewalk.

462
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:46,332
It was too narrow...

463
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:51,559
Is the path not for just anyone?

464
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,141
What are you trying to say?

465
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:54,491
"Date just anyone?"

466
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:57,175
Do you think I'm someone
just waiting around?

467
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:59,896
You must have really put
yourself out there...

468
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,226
to get him to declare forcibly that
you are together, right?

469
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,951
Can you even hear yourself?

470
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,616
You can't handle drinks and get wasted.

471
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:11,311
How did you even manage to live alone?

472
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,178
That's interesting. What a mystery.

473
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:18,775
Just because we shared a drink,

474
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:21,127
it doesn't make me an easy target.

475
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:23,758
- What?
- I've still got it.

476
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:26,315
No wonder guys like me.

477
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:28,268
I can't help but be attractive.

478
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:30,765
How can I stop that?

479
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:31,823
Don't you agree?

480
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,231
What?

481
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,575
You tangle up nicely.

482
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,073
Is this how you snag men?

483
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,314
For crying out loud!

484
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:53,712
My word!

485
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,975
- There you are.
- What's this?

486
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:06,610
Where is our team?

487
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:09,993
- My word.
- Fire me instead.

488
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,850
You don't have to trouble my team!

489
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,510
Trouble?

490
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,445
This isn't trouble, but care.

491
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:19,350
Forcing something unwanted
is nothing but tyranny.

492
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,117
I barely saved you from being
sent to a small town.

493
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:24,164
Then I'll just quit.

494
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,700
Look, Gang Min Ju!

495
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,612
I'm screwed if you bail on this.

496
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,453
Nobody pulls the weight like you.

497
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:31,476
That's why I've managed this far.

498
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:33,562
I've done my fair share.

499
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:36,634
I'm even losing my passion for dramas.

500
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:39,301
Honestly, I don't have the energy.

501
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:43,222
There needed to be an excuse
for the plagiarism case.

502
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:44,750
I get where you're coming from.

503
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,245
You did great. I never said you didn't.

504
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,270
Just come up with a hit.

505
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,640
Then it'll be like nothing happened.

506
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,485
Making all those choices in life,

507
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:04,903
I felt a sense of pride for making them.

508
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,297
But there was also self-doubt...

509
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,521
from all the regret.

510
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:18,911
Don't lose your temper and quit work.

511
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:20,918
Just endure it.

512
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:22,215
That doesn't mean you're losing.

513
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:23,681
Life is a long journey.

514
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:31,215
Do come in, Chief Ko.

515
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:33,526
I asked for you to share something.

516
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:34,938
- Take a seat.
- All right.

517
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:40,956
For the grape festival in our city,

518
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:42,973
the Corporate Support Team
will organize the event.

519
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,999
And the Regional Tourism Team
will take over the logistics.

520
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,058
Wait a minute.

521
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,272
My team originally planned
the grape festival.

522
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:52,473
I'm aware of that.

523
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:55,465
But things changed after the merge.

524
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:56,510
After the merge?

525
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:59,563
My team's idea got picked fair and square,

526
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:01,933
and we were promised to organize it!

527
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,891
I know that your team worked hard.

528
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:08,363
You must be sensitive about it
regarding the bonus.

529
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:12,098
But we can discuss the matter afterward.

530
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:14,307
Director Shin.

531
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:18,271
Yes, it's important to provide a bonus...

532
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:19,585
to those who worked hard.

533
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,959
But what matters more is this!

534
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,783
We covered all the details
of the festival...

535
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,335
and worked with the community.

536
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:28,743
And nobody knows it better than us!

537
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:32,310
That can't simply be solved
with some paperwork!

538
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,176
Keep your voice down!

539
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,770
We're with the Deputy Mayor here.

540
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:47,089
Send all the festival files
to the Corporate Support Team.

541
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:50,651
Chief Ko, that is ours to take over.

542
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,578
Why? This is ridiculous.

543
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,269
We gave up on our summer holidays...

544
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:56,173
and worked through nights for it.

545
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:58,166
To develop this local community...

546
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,432
Don't you think I know that?

547
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:04,518
Let's just be grateful that
it wasn't canceled.

548
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:08,703
What matters is the community,
not us taking credit.

549
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:12,080
But this is so unfair.

550
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:21,202
You came.

551
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:23,190
- Boss.
- Boss.

552
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,798
You should do some cleaning.

553
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,590
Okay, planning is everything. Got it?

554
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,518
How could they do this?

555
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,054
Making that apology about plagiarism...

556
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:35,989
turned out to save the network's face.

557
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,927
So how could they demote us?

558
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,497
Yes, and we know who caused it.

559
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:44,414
Demoted? Don't underestimate this team.

560
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:47,199
I'm glad to have Producer Gang.

561
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,967
Yes, Planning Teams No. 1 and No. 2
are doing very well,

562
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,598
but we always come in short.

563
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,311
That's why it's a demotion.

564
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:57,563
Min Ju, you explain it to them.

565
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:59,501
- Take care.
- Bye.

566
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,259
That loser.

567
00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:04,908
We can come up with something good.

568
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:16,356
As people get older,

569
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:19,019
it gets harder to tell right from wrong.

570
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,479
Out of the way.

571
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,490
Mister.

572
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:26,002
What in the world are you doing?

573
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:28,752
Being righteous gives you trouble.

574
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,703
And if you stand out like a needle,

575
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:32,785
you are given the hammer.

576
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,967
When doing right gets you wronged,

577
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:39,439
you compromise to survive...

578
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,939
and take comfort
by thinking life is unfair.

579
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,474
But for how long?

580
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:49,874
How much longer must I keep this up?

581
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:54,814
How much longer must I keep this up?

582
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:08,299
(To Gang Min Ju: I'm sorry)

583
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,339
Jun.

584
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,627
I'll take the check.

585
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:48,050
Is this everything?

586
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,942
She has reordered five times already.

587
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,936
Jun, it's not like that.

588
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:57,560
I ordered everything on here,
but it wasn't any good.

589
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,474
It was too tasteless for my palate.

590
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,196
Put it on my card.

591
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,968
This settles the bill,

592
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:09,236
but I'm afraid she will be
put on our blacklist.

593
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,046
Blacklist?

594
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,511
That's absurd. What did I do?

595
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,511
Sit down.

596
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:27,710
Take this and eat what you want.

597
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,376
Whether it's street or hotel food.

598
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:33,176
I don't want money,
but just for you to cook for me.

599
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:34,378
Not anymore.

600
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,600
How could treat me like this?

601
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,224
I became anorexic as a model
from craving your food.

602
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:43,242
You always cause trouble
and have me come to you.

603
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,651
I'm tired of it.

604
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:46,687
Jun.

605
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,864
I like someone.

606
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,842
So don't call me now.

607
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:51,892
What?

608
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:56,300
I'm also changing my number.

609
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,165
No, please don't do that.

610
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:03,490
From now on, you're on your own.

611
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,630
Jun! Jun!

612
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:12,625
- Tae Yeon.
- Yes?

613
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,515
So that's your profession.

614
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:17,684
But are you really of that age?

615
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:20,516
Don't you have other questions?

616
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:23,655
You keep asking about my age.

617
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:29,668
Sorry, but I'll leave now.

618
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:32,338
You can excuse me first.

619
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:33,861
I'll pick up the check.

620
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,811
What? What a loser.

621
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:39,917
My goodness.

622
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:43,450
Wait, who came by?

623
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,772
He mentioned that the car owner
is picky...

624
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,648
and asked for a thorough job.

625
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,285
Who did?

626
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:55,700
Ko Sang Sik from the city hall.

627
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,781
I'll let you know after waxing it.

628
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,077
You can pick it up then.

629
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:11,411
I wanted to quit, but stopped myself.

630
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:14,493
Thanks for looking out for me.

631
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,335
I'll have the same thing,
but make it large.

632
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,060
- Chief Ko.
- What?

633
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,382
I could never be a civil servant like you.

634
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,940
Why would you want to be me?

635
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,213
You're all about rules and integrity,

636
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:38,188
and your closet doesn't even
have a skeleton.

637
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:39,854
Are you buttering up your boss?

638
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:42,852
Why did you take the civil service exam?

639
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,885
You did something else before.

640
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:48,350
The paycheck comes every month, okay?

641
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,893
What did you do before?

642
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:55,300
Instead of wasting your curiosity,

643
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,799
you should help the farmers
at the festival.

644
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:00,662
What's this for?

645
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:03,396
The meal allowance is seven bucks.

646
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,054
But you got the meal in a large size.

647
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:07,034
I can't believe that guy.

648
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:15,544
This is way better.

649
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,230
What are you doing here?

650
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,122
I'm here for kitchen supplies.

651
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:26,194
Does it really look better?

652
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:29,260
Yes, it will suit your kitchen.

653
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,360
Okay, it's easier to have you decide.

654
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,005
I'm a man of fine taste.

655
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,636
Well, did you get my text?

656
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,285
Yes.

657
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,354
Sorry, I feel really bad.

658
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:52,809
To be honest, it wasn't all that bad.

659
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:58,506
But I wasn't jumping for joy.

660
00:38:58,506 --> 00:38:59,623
What does that mean?

661
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:05,613
I just found it better than
nothing happening.

662
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:24,228
Why did you take the civil service exam?

663
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,015
What did you do before?

664
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:15,636
Hurry! Get out of there!

665
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,107
Don't let go!

666
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:47,879
Thanks for picking out dishes
and carrying them.

667
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,495
You're welcome.

668
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:51,256
I wish it is always like today.

669
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:56,782
I'll think of you as a brother
and talk casually.

670
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:58,826
Then we'll get closer.

671
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,265
Good night.

672
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,946
Eun Ho, don't you love what I got?

673
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:43,681
I picked them out for you.

674
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:50,269
I'm a man of fine taste.

675
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:10,330
(The Grape Festival)

676
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,090
- It's hot today.
- You see...

677
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,531
Here you go.

678
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:16,003
What's all this?

679
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:18,307
It's from the participating farmers.

680
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,085
They want to treat our hard work.

681
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,065
- Return it now.
- What?

682
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:26,872
Line up and pay at the festival
if you want a taste.

683
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:28,706
How could you bring it here?

684
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:31,340
I can't believe you.

685
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:34,529
It's not like this costs millions.

686
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,237
I carried it here for nothing.

687
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:38,086
Hurry and take it back.

688
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,240
Sure thing.

689
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,160
Let's hurry back.

690
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,924
The grape festival?

691
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,502
Yes, there is one in Woori City.

692
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,237
They invited our male lead.

693
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:49,566
So what did he say?

694
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:51,373
Since we're filming there already,

695
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:54,022
he's going to drop by after
and sign autographs.

696
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,669
And he’ll even join us
for the grape crushing event.

697
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:57,805
Really? That's good.

698
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,175
Producer Gang.

699
00:44:00,845 --> 00:44:02,847
I'm not Producer Gang, but just Gang.

700
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:03,974
Come on.

701
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,308
You're the gangster in our industry.

702
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:09,007
I feel bad for you.

703
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,101
The plagiarism case got you
demoted to planning.

704
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:13,582
That's what happened.

705
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:16,118
You worked hard with Producer Han.

706
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:18,422
Now you can talk to me.

707
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,822
What?

708
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:21,151
Are we in some endless loop?

709
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,799
I can't seem to escape you.

710
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,567
I'll switch networks
if you reject it again.

711
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:29,336
It won't get picked up that way.

712
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:32,765
How can you be so harsh?

713
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:36,389
Your plot needs work
and the heroine feels fake.

714
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:37,678
That can't happen.

715
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,256
I guess you haven't dated.

716
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:41,214
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

717
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:43,815
It's obvious you haven't been dating
for a long time.

718
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:46,976
That's why you're saying such nonsense.

719
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,952
Nonsense?

720
00:44:53,612 --> 00:44:55,128
Min Ju.

721
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:56,650
Are you getting off work?

722
00:44:57,837 --> 00:45:00,913
Wow, what a hot guy.

723
00:45:01,336 --> 00:45:03,691
My word, it's a dream camper van.

724
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:06,777
Who is that?

725
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:07,996
Well...

726
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,049
I'm a master of timing.

727
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,322
I know when I'm welcome.

728
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:21,706
Why are you out in a camper?

729
00:45:21,706 --> 00:45:23,586
Are you talking casually now?

730
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:24,622
Does it bother you?

731
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,712
No, it’s great to feel friendlier.

732
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,893
You asked where to get groceries.

733
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,340
Today is market day.

734
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,020
Do they sell all those ingredients?

735
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Of course.

736
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:38,126
But why do you need a camper?

737
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:39,549
This is for work.

738
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:42,709
I've driven this all over the country.

739
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:45,128
- Are you a traveling chef?
- Something like that.

740
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:50,142
He is surrounded by family.

741
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:51,653
Do you mean Sang Sik?

742
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:52,796
That's how it is.

743
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:55,844
We sometimes take trips together.

744
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:57,941
- How about you join us?
- No thanks.

745
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,386
Where is the marketplace?

746
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,152
We're almost there.

747
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,483
There is no need to worry.

748
00:46:05,483 --> 00:46:08,147
When the festival attracts more tourists,

749
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:10,835
you'll get to sell more products.

750
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,003
We're planning for short-term effects
as well as for the long haul,

751
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,003
so we must host
this festival successfully.

752
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:18,307
If it weren't for the festival,

753
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:21,547
we would have thrown away
these good grapes.

754
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:24,211
We trust that you will lead us.

755
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:25,684
Thanks for everything.

756
00:46:25,684 --> 00:46:27,414
That's for me to say.

757
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,035
Come on.

758
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,763
Let me get your fresh stash.

759
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:35,356
Don't even think about it.

760
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:38,285
I'll sell what's on the stand first.

761
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:40,636
I made you that cake before.

762
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:42,548
Didn't your granddaughter like it?

763
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:44,744
I forgot about that.

764
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:46,978
Just wait there.

765
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:50,064
You're good at this.

766
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:55,501
The dates with seeds are sweet
and taste better.

767
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:57,220
Dates?

768
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,720
They are dried palm fruits.

769
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,121
Let's see here.

770
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,217
I'll take it.

771
00:47:06,217 --> 00:47:07,943
Who is this with you?

772
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,306
Well.

773
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:10,616
Isn't she pretty?

774
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:11,616
Is she your aunt?

775
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:17,158
How could you run a business
with such a bad eye?

776
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:26,781
- Chief Ko.
- What?

777
00:47:27,974 --> 00:47:29,335
What are you doing?

778
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:31,542
This shot proves we're working.

779
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:33,137
The hat looks good on you.

780
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,259
Good grief, you're slacking off again.

781
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:40,004
Chief Ko, try this grape, it's delicious.

782
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,004
No thanks.

783
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,212
You told me to check everything.

784
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:47,523
How else could we tell if it's good?

785
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,596
What are you even doing?

786
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:55,718
The skin has many nutrients.

787
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:06,813
My word!

788
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:10,060
Chief Ko, come over here.

789
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,069
What now?

790
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:12,836
Hurry up!

791
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:15,675
What's the matter now?

792
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:19,181
What? It's cold.

793
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,194
Don't you see a valve there?

794
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:24,295
I don't see it here.

795
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:36,445
Come on, move out of the way.

796
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:37,769
It's so refreshing.

797
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:44,097
What was that? What are you doing?

798
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:46,388
That was fast.

799
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:47,408
What?

800
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,944
Dear me, you got wet.

801
00:48:51,944 --> 00:48:54,255
But it was refreshing, right?

802
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:57,947
I guess, but you're all soaked.

803
00:48:57,947 --> 00:48:59,815
Good grief, what are you looking at?

804
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:02,829
I didn't see anything.

805
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:04,923
I can't with you blowing hot and cold.

806
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,264
I was playing hard to get.

807
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:13,831
What's with the long face?

808
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,179
Are you upset that you were
mistaken for my aunt?

809
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:21,192
What? I don't mind that.

810
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:24,206
Don't worry, I won't call you auntie.

811
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:25,812
I'm a grown woman.

812
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:27,320
A grown woman?

813
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,289
That sounds nice as well.

814
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,966
Someone must be in a rush.

815
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:47,619
Is she your girlfriend?

816
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:50,721
I can't stand being doubted.

817
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,539
I may be popular,
but I'm not a two-timer type.

818
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,641
Your type suggests that two isn't enough.

819
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:01,419
There is only one in my eyes.

820
00:50:01,419 --> 00:50:04,331
We'll be awkward if you keep it up.

821
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:08,916
Awkward about what? I'm your teacher.

822
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:13,780
- I teach you cooking.
- I see.

823
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,819
Does that mean we have both age
and status to consider?

824
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:21,581
This romance has many obstacles.

825
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,688
Good grief.

826
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,159
You catch a bus here, right?

827
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,188
Yes.

828
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:35,054
Chief Ko.

829
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:37,728
How do I look?

830
00:50:37,728 --> 00:50:39,100
The hat is too big.

831
00:50:42,894 --> 00:50:44,641
Chief Ko.

832
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,669
What did you think of me
at my job interview?

833
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:50,308
Why do you ask that?

834
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,214
I'm just curious.

835
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:58,775
I thought you'd be thorough
and capable at work.

836
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:02,994
Not like that.

837
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,402
Like if I appeared cool, intellectual,

838
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:09,694
thoughtful, and stuff like that.

839
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:12,407
Well.

840
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:15,105
You seemed thorough and capable.

841
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,866
For crying out loud.

842
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:24,558
Hello, Sang Sik!

843
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:25,686
Hello.

844
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:27,217
Ms. Han, hello.

845
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:30,995
I have a crush on you.

846
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,357
Hello there.

847
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:40,693
Are you getting back now?

848
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:41,853
Well, yes.

849
00:51:41,853 --> 00:51:45,153
We were getting things ready
for the grape festival.

850
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,263
Where were you today?

851
00:51:47,263 --> 00:51:48,991
I went for a drive.

852
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:51,596
Then are you two on a date?

853
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:06,911
Isn't she the employee?

854
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:09,206
The one who gave you flowers?

855
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,406
Yes, that's her.

856
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:12,638
Really?

857
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:15,801
Some might mistake her for your kid.

858
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,421
What are you saying?

859
00:52:18,421 --> 00:52:20,564
I mean, it's a possibility.

860
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:21,996
What's a possibility?

861
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:25,669
Aren't you dating her after
the flower thing?

862
00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:28,302
What date? I was out working.

863
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:30,042
You two were cute together.

864
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:32,810
Who are you to talk after
doing what you did?

865
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,162
Me? What have I done?

866
00:52:35,162 --> 00:52:37,106
Come on, Sang Sik.

867
00:52:37,106 --> 00:52:38,627
Forget it.

868
00:52:38,627 --> 00:52:41,892
Don't get worked up about
some office romance.

869
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,146
- What?
- She's not underage.

870
00:52:44,146 --> 00:52:46,072
And you got a flower bouquet
when she confessed.

871
00:52:46,072 --> 00:52:48,800
Who would I even meet at this age?

872
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,099
What does age matter? Why can't you date?

873
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:52,240
My word.

874
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,580
It's the heart that counts.

875
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,611
There is nothing in your way.

876
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,300
Come on, seriously.

877
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,981
Family matters, but you come first.

878
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:04,187
- Don't you agree?
- Exactly.

879
00:53:04,187 --> 00:53:05,187
What...

880
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:14,922
(Grape Festival 2016)

881
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:19,261
Chief Ko, I checked the quantity.

882
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:20,677
Good work.

883
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,103
Did you see the weather forecast?

884
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,458
- Yes.
- They said it might rain.

885
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,124
What? Rain when it's so sunny?

886
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,043
There could be a rain shower,

887
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:30,556
so get the tents ready.

888
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:32,753
The raincoats and umbrellas as well.

889
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:38,382
Here, take this.

890
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,676
You can stick it on the rear window.

891
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,709
What's this?

892
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:45,134
Chief Ko brought it over for you.

893
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,552
I'm just the messenger.

894
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:53,719
(New car! Keep your distance!)

895
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:07,075
Please come to the grape festival.

896
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:10,592
Well, hello.

897
00:54:10,592 --> 00:54:12,168
Hello.

898
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:14,048
You must be busy, right?

899
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:16,969
There was a buzz about Mr. Wook coming,

900
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:18,599
but he can't make it.

901
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,003
I won't keep you.

902
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,095
Excuse me.

903
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:22,878
Yes?

904
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,174
No, never mind.

905
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:35,195
She ticks me off every time.

906
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:37,462
I have a bad feeling about her.

907
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:47,010
I thought Mr. Wook was coming.

908
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,402
They said he would.

909
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,666
What a scam. There is nothing to see.

910
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:51,842
I thought Mr. Wook was coming.

911
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:54,115
We came for nothing.

912
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:55,639
Are they scamming us?

913
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:57,555
How long do we have to wait?

914
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,522
Min Ju.

915
00:55:01,151 --> 00:55:03,171
What are you doing out here?

916
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:06,878
I held a dessert-tasting event here.

917
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:08,911
Really? Is it over now?

918
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:11,237
The desserts ran out fast.

919
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:12,912
But the festival isn't over.

920
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:13,923
Is that so?

921
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:19,677
The wine is made with grapes
grown in our city.

922
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:21,628
It has a great aroma with depth.

923
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,387
Chief Ko!

924
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:27,222
Take a break with some wine.

925
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:32,262
No, it's okay.

926
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:36,684
Deputy Mayor, please pose for the camera.

927
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:39,012
- All right.
- Please take pictures.

928
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:58,019
Are you really going to do this?

929
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:00,125
Yes, it looks fun.

930
00:56:02,499 --> 00:56:03,822
Hurry and join me.

931
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:10,955
This way, everybody.

932
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:13,172
Mothers, step in with your kids.

933
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:16,006
Right this way.

934
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:18,605
- How fun.
- Step in here.

935
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:20,541
Let's crush these grapes.

936
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:21,757
It's fun.

937
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:24,334
Give it a try, and have fun.

938
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:31,236
Hop in here.

939
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:33,836
This is fun.

940
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:37,397
Don't just watch, but try it.

941
00:56:44,597 --> 00:56:46,055
Careful, you might trip.

942
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:48,410
Watch your step.

943
00:57:11,196 --> 00:57:12,630
It's a rain shower.

944
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,872
It won't let up soon. This way.

945
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,781
(Grape Festival 2016)

946
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:42,134
We're giving out raincoats!

947
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:46,574
Take one with you.

948
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:48,854
I knew this would happen.

949
00:57:48,854 --> 00:57:49,885
What are we going to do?

950
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:53,253
The tourists are leaving since
the star isn't here.

951
00:57:53,253 --> 00:57:55,783
What if we put all this together,

952
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:57,541
but it ends up failing?

953
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,662
The other team organized it,

954
00:57:59,662 --> 00:58:02,445
so they will take the fall.

955
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,014
They will probably blame us.

956
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,077
Look at us working to death here.

957
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:08,552
This is so unfair.

958
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:55,093
- My goodness!
- What happened?

959
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:56,142
Are you okay?

960
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,392
Goodness, you're soaked.

961
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:02,655
It's okay.

962
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:05,567
I'm worried about the festival
in this weather.

963
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,694
You don't have to worry.

964
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:10,671
We're mostly finished with the events,

965
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:12,823
and there is some selling left.

966
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:16,190
You head back first.
I'll wrap it up and inform you.

967
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,936
All right, do a good job.

968
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:19,053
I will.

969
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:21,081
You, hurry up!

970
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:34,702
I'll help with everything here.

971
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:35,938
You can head back.

972
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,169
My goodness, my word.

973
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:54,516
- Are you all wet?
- No worries.

974
00:59:54,516 --> 00:59:57,240
Sang Sik worked so hard on this.

975
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:02,502
You're getting a call.

976
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:12,324
I'll take a look over there.

977
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:32,625
Something came up.

978
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:33,825
Get back if it's urgent.

979
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:36,473
I'll hang here until the rain lets up.

980
01:00:36,473 --> 01:00:37,768
Let's go, I'll take you back.

981
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,392
No, I'm totally fine.

982
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,181
Then I'll call you later.

983
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:13,668
What are you doing here? Get back.

984
01:01:13,668 --> 01:01:15,452
Is this the last thing left?

985
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:17,355
It's dangerous. Just go.

986
01:01:17,355 --> 01:01:18,837
Let me help you.

987
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:19,878
I'm done with it.

988
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:21,458
For crying out loud.

989
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,727
- Put this on.
- No, it's okay.

990
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:29,136
Stop being stubborn. Put it on.

991
01:01:29,136 --> 01:01:31,066
- I said it's okay.
- Now here.

992
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:36,930
- Chief Ko, over here!
- Okay.

993
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,068
Get yourself back.

994
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,643
You get over there.

995
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:54,911
- I'll head that way.
- Okay.

996
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:00,982
Are you done with everything?

997
01:02:00,982 --> 01:02:02,535
What are you still doing here?

998
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:04,567
Can you get back now?

999
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,764
Of course!

1000
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,247
Then let's go together!

1001
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:12,176
I'm soaked through and through, anyway.

1002
01:02:17,555 --> 01:02:18,662
This won't do!

1003
01:02:34,423 --> 01:02:36,027
Why not?

1004
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:37,746
It's the heart that counts.

1005
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:42,466
What does age matter? Why can't you date?

1006
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:45,427
Family matters, but you come first.

1007
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,563
What are you doing?

1008
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,187
Let's run!

1009
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,044
(Second to Last Love)

1010
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:54,612
Why would you make scammers out of us?

1011
01:03:54,612 --> 01:03:56,532
Leave it. This is my problem.

1012
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,516
Why are you being tough and mean to me?

1013
01:03:58,516 --> 01:04:00,622
Otherwise, you'd be causing
chaos everywhere.

1014
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:03,004
So you fell for Min Ju on the first day?

1015
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,677
No, even before that.

1016
01:04:05,562 --> 01:04:06,889
I'm serious, Sang Sik.

1017
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:08,289
What is this?

1018
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:09,690
Why am I like this?

1019
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,657
If you don't do anything,

1020
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:13,259
nothing will happen.

1021
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:15,259
