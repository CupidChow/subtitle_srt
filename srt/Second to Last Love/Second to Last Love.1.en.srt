1
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:18,383
Why would there be a kiss in the scene?

2
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,064
They broke up.

3
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:22,040
He ditched her for another chick.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,419
The viewers won't get it.

5
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,417
It's a different story with her.

6
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:29,296
He leeched off her money, body, and heart.

7
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,501
Given their age, why wouldn't they
have a roll in the hay?

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:37,452
Romantic fantasies are nice,
but let's keep it real.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,682
What does my age have to do with it?

10
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:46,237
I don't care. Let's talk tomorrow.

11
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,546
Mister, your light turned green.

12
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:59,665
Son, I'm almost home.

13
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:02,128
What? You are coming out with Dad?

14
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,899
What for? We'll meet up soon.

15
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,317
Sweetie, should I stay put here?

16
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,180
Okay, hurry up. I love you!

17
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,034
Are you all right?

18
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,647
Honey!

19
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,754
- Honey, are you okay?
- Honey.

20
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,378
What's the matter?

21
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,641
Are you out of your mind?

22
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,874
- Hold on.
- You kicked his balls.

23
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,073
Why, you little!

24
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:45,280
- Let me explain.
- You're dead.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,866
- Hear me out.
- Why in God's name?

26
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:50,334
I'm sorry about that.

27
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,175
No, it's my mistake.

28
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:57,515
That's why I asked you to take me along.

29
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,597
- Are you okay now?
- Yes.

30
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,471
Who cares if we are neighbors?

31
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,455
(Han Jeong Sik)

32
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,047
What's up?

33
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,206
Why did you hang up?

34
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,721
You called me son and sweetie.

35
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,975
I got caught up in something.

36
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,648
Did someone make a pass at the old maid?

37
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:03,739
Enough with the age jabs.

38
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,090
You should have listened when
I told you to snag a guy.

39
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,707
But you're so picky.

40
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,713
I thought you wanted to get real.

41
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:11,717
Forget it!

42
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,760
But how was my acting?

43
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,094
Pretty good, right?

44
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:28,522
(Second to Last Love)

45
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,337
(Episode 1)

46
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,639
Kids, out of the way!

47
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,167
- Look, let's go.
- Look, let's go.

48
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,230
You're not supposed to
block the bike lane.

49
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:53,743
(Have another safe day!)

50
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:06,086
You! Ko Sang Sik!

51
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,365
You, there!

52
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:09,851
Wait a minute.

53
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:16,498
What?

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Hurry up.

55
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,440
You shouldn't jaywalk like that.

56
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,599
My goodness, let me go.

57
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,875
Relax, it won't kill me.

58
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,190
You know me.

59
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,062
I'm Dokgo Bong.

60
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,395
I'm this close to reporting
your traffic violations.

61
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:35,836
I mean, come on.

62
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,716
You should become nicer with age.

63
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,575
Don't regret things from your grave.

64
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,837
Ta-da.

65
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:44,958
My word.

66
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,877
Lately, I crave these magazines
more than porn videos.

67
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,158
Hasn't it been a while
since you saw these?

68
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,755
They're nice to read now and then.

69
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:52,755
Ta-da.

70
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,836
My word, for crying out loud!

71
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,531
These beauties were made for viewing.

72
00:05:58,531 --> 00:05:59,570
My goodness.

73
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,597
And scrap this piece of junk.

74
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:03,844
There are nice cars these days.

75
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:08,123
As you get older,
you should look the part.

76
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,380
No, thanks.

77
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,098
That pollutes the environment.

78
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,336
But I won't stop you, old-timer.

79
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:15,943
Who are you calling old?

80
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:19,170
You're the one with the stuffy look.

81
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,059
Chief Ko!

82
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:28,626
Look at that guy.
It's always good to be young.

83
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:35,175
Even if you got scared,

84
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,547
how could you kick his groins?

85
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,126
I guess you're still a woman.

86
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,239
Isn't that right?

87
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,068
This screams female, not male.

88
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:49,976
After turning 40,
I'm not sure whether I'm Jack or Jill.

89
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,498
There isn't enough sex for that.

90
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,015
- Look here!
- Count me out.

91
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:57,231
My sex life could hit menopause,
but it will never run dry.

92
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,041
Well, lucky you.

93
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,759
But your men only last a week.

94
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,875
She can't get enough action
after her divorce.

95
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,276
If not now, when can I have fun?

96
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,582
This body will start wrinkling every year.

97
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,092
Min Ju, isn't this too much food?

98
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:16,500
Look here.

99
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,862
Starting at the age of 45,

100
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:22,068
female hormone levels start to drop.

101
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,122
So for women at our age,

102
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:27,797
we need to help boost estrogen
secretion and production

103
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,051
by consuming healthy food.

104
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,183
- Is that why you asked us to come here?
- Yes.

105
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,472
What we eat really matters
when you're our age.

106
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:37,356
If your sex drive isn't satisfied,
indulge your appetite.

107
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,277
I'm fine with how things are.

108
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:41,856
Shall we raise our glasses?

109
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,993
To bid farewell to youth
and embrace twilight?

110
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,798
Why put it like that?

111
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,199
After 40 years in the shadows,

112
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,024
let's bask in our prime.

113
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,255
Yes, whatever it may be,

114
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,804
I'm hoping for some excitement.

115
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:58,883
After working hard all these years,

116
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,473
let's toast to estrogen!

117
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:01,879
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

118
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:09,618
- What's up?
- Boss, where are you?

119
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:10,920
We need you here.

120
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
What's the matter?

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,862
Mr. Firecracker got worked up again...

122
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,058
and stormed off the filming set.

123
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,069
What?

124
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,767
If you're that skeptical,
take a leap yourself.

125
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,868
What's with the push? Let go.

126
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,788
Chief Ko, look here.

127
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,891
The ropes are sturdy.

128
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,614
How about we jump together?

129
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,623
Me? With you?

130
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:55,728
Why would I do that?

131
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,404
Trust me, it's bound to work out.

132
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,895
This place will buzz with tourists.

133
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,178
What's this? It tears right off.

134
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,258
The Maintenance Team can replace it.

135
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,969
Everything else looks okay.

136
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:14,364
How can you say this is okay
and ask me to jump?

137
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:16,217
What if it's the death of me?

138
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,078
The project is so low budget.

139
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:22,757
Cost-cutting could put lives at risk.

140
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:25,993
It's a better investment than
building a subpar park.

141
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,455
Taichi in the shade?

142
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,942
- Is that a shot at my proposal?
- No, sir.

143
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,658
Double-check before it runs.

144
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,963
- If something goes wrong...
- I'll take care of it.

145
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,156
You won't climb the ladder
unless you ease up.

146
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:44,582
That sense of responsibility is why
you can't take leaps.

147
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,802
Chief Ko and Mr. Cha, get over here!

148
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,734
- What's going on?
- Look there.

149
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:57,090
The Environment Facilities Team is
to merge with the Regional Tourism Team?

150
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,291
Chief Ko.

151
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,990
From that very moment,

152
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,410
my once peaceful life crashed
into a wave of turmoil.

153
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,264
- Producer Gang.
- What needs fixing first?

154
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:11,775
The lead actor is missing.

155
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,045
That troublemaker.

156
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,287
Then there's the plagiarism lawsuit
and script review.

157
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,104
That's too many.

158
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:19,784
And why does everything fall on me?

159
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,876
Is everyone sitting on their hands?

160
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,243
- Come with me.
- That hurts.

161
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,443
I apologize.

162
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:32,348
But I'm needed at a shoot now.

163
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,550
What's the call for?

164
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,140
People are saying our series is trash,

165
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,019
and a reporter wants a comment.

166
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,019
Trash?

167
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,822
Hello? Which press are you from?

168
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,826
It's me, Gang Min Ju.

169
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,219
With our high ratings, what's the fuss?

170
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,940
It simply means that viewers
are taking an interest.

171
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,641
Adultery?

172
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,897
Have you watched our series?

173
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,398
You must be blind.

174
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:02,013
How is that adultery?

175
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:04,284
It's only unrequited love,

176
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:06,926
and the guy loves his wife again.

177
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,933
The scripts aren't last minute.

178
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,528
Are you bashing my series
for the rival show?

179
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,791
How much did you get paid?

180
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,287
I'll explain it over dinner,
so take it down.

181
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,972
You'll have my response.

182
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,215
Take down your article,
or you will get nothing!

183
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,491
They stop at nothing for views.

184
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,639
These copy-and-paste reporters!

185
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,049
- Producer Gang.
- Have you located him?

186
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,114
Not yet.

187
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,609
I told you not to cast him.

188
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,073
But you didn't listen.

189
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,098
He was doing great until now.

190
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,281
What did you say?

191
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,082
The kiss yesterday was disgusting
without any spark.

192
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:51,362
And there was stammering.

193
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,993
Without a hint of feeling,

194
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:55,273
all he did was stare intensely.

195
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,513
The script was delivered late.

196
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,710
You take credit for success,
and yet blame the writer?

197
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,710
Think again.

198
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,613
You're all over the place directing it,

199
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,814
so no wonder the actor bailed!

200
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,175
Relax.

201
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,213
Here.

202
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,065
Vitamins, minerals, and omega-3.

203
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,284
The division head has been asking for you.

204
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,115
My head is throbbing.

205
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,901
Darling, you're here.

206
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,627
Who are all these people?

207
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:32,784
Fresh recruits.

208
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,029
And don't call me "darling."

209
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,829
But we go way back.

210
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:39,037
It only shows that we bond.

211
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,595
What we have right now
is a total disaster.

212
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,938
Sure thing.

213
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,074
Go ahead and greet our hitmaker.

214
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:48,107
She is the ultimate superwoman
here at our network.

215
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,996
This is Chief Producer Gang Min Ju.

216
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:52,012
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,597
I don't have time for this.

218
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:55,637
Yes, of course. Let's go.

219
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,751
The division head is asking for you.

220
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:00,438
Why are you making me deal with it?

221
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:03,110
You're my partner and superwoman.

222
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,208
For crying out loud.

223
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:08,763
Why are they merging us?

224
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,486
Chief Ko, how can they do this?

225
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,064
With the Regional Tourism Team?

226
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,025
What do they take us for?

227
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:20,245
This isn't integrating.

228
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,574
It's more like dissolving us...

229
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:23,633
and giving us new assignments.

230
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,913
Exactly. We've had some rough patches,

231
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,371
but this takes it too far.

232
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,747
The newly appointed
deputy mayor is to blame.

233
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:34,849
Be quiet and take your seats.

234
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:43,015
- I can't believe this.
- What is it?

235
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,696
The nitpicker who posted
absurd complaints...

236
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:49,056
is celebrated as a top advocate.

237
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:50,056
What?

238
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,590
They actually picked this madman?

239
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:56,474
That's right.

240
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,019
I'm the madman you're talking about.

241
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,555
Are you disappointed I'm not a man?

242
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,230
May I ask who you are?

243
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,176
Are you the infamous nitpicker?

244
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:12,041
Yes, I'm that nitpicker.

245
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,319
I flooded your message board
for the past three months

246
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,281
to become your nitpicker Na Chun Wu.

247
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,457
Aren't you the deputy mayor?

248
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,243
You guessed right.

249
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:31,660
I'm the newly appointed deputy mayor.

250
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,960
Nice to meet you.

251
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,427
I look forward to working with you.

252
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,666
Chief Ko Sang Sik.

253
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,714
Gather all your files for this year...

254
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,610
and brief them in my office.

255
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,892
This instant.

256
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,414
From how I see it,

257
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:09,772
this falls under plagiarism.

258
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:11,434
What are you saying?

259
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,868
We must acknowledge what's needed...

260
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:15,932
and issue an apology.

261
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,524
The writer had no idea that
such a piece existed...

262
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,052
and never came across it.

263
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,594
Whether she knew or encountered it...

264
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,636
isn't what matters here.

265
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,860
The concept of the drama overlaps,

266
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,228
along with the dramatic elements,
narrative,

267
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,062
all the central characters,

268
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:34,119
props, costumes, and even lines
replicated word by word.

269
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:37,079
Originality is hard to come by.

270
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,320
Stories have stuck to a pattern
ever since Shakespeare.

271
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,408
Their minds could work alike.

272
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,828
That's how we got out of many.

273
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:47,921
What?

274
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,193
The cases that ruled out plagiarism...

275
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:52,080
wasn't due to absolute certainty.

276
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,464
There just wasn't enough evidence.

277
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:56,614
Simply put,

278
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,275
it was suspected without evidence.

279
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,218
And since it became challenging
to prove this point,

280
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:07,352
many slipped through the cracks
regarding copyright issues.

281
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:08,448
I get it.

282
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,576
But do you know what would happen...

283
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,859
if we admit to plagiarism?

284
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,296
Do you want to be out of a job?

285
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:17,099
What are you waiting for?

286
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,829
Sir, please.

287
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,643
It's uncommon to reach such a verdict.

288
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:22,971
You know that.

289
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,562
People forget when it's dragged out.

290
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:26,858
That's how it will end.

291
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,019
Times have changed.

292
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,986
Plagiarism has become a hot potato
in politics and academia,

293
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:32,829
and we're caught in the backlash.

294
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,332
Gang Min Ju.

295
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,535
What?

296
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,092
Damn it.

297
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,078
I'll meet with the guy.

298
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,965
I've come to realize this with age.

299
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:52,230
The choices you make become your life.

300
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:56,652
The only option is to have
the case dropped.

301
00:16:56,652 --> 00:17:00,096
I'll meet with the webtoon artist
and convince him.

302
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,864
- Are you serious?
- For real?

303
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,741
But whether it's a good or bad choice...

304
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,448
is only revealed in hindsight.

305
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:11,655
But under one condition.

306
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,684
For my next mini-series,

307
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,066
I want to cast Song Joong Ki.

308
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,066
Song Joong Ki?

309
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,163
You're asking for too much.

310
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:26,568
He's taken for a 50-episode series.

311
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:29,105
I worked my ass off for that.

312
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:32,519
Then forget it.
I'll have you figure it out.

313
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,466
No, wait a minute.

314
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:38,129
I promise, as long as you fix this.

315
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,570
All right, deal?

316
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,354
Chief Ko,

317
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,648
I know that you've managed well.

318
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:52,226
You take credit for getting
our projects approved,

319
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:55,346
which has helped secure more city budget.

320
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:56,397
Bravo.

321
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,477
But is this everything?

322
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:05,273
This is the latest arboretum project.

323
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:07,356
This one failed.

324
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:09,252
This got suspended.

325
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,790
And this was tossed elsewhere.

326
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:15,924
It's more than obvious why your team...

327
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,454
got merged with other assignments.

328
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:22,886
My goodness.

329
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,816
Wait, why is that there?

330
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,909
Is this what you are working on?

331
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,537
No, you see...

332
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,313
No...

333
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,546
Goodness.

334
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,497
- I can explain...
- Forget it.

335
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:48,494
You're drowning in work as it is,
so why take on more?

336
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,487
Just leave it to Producer Han
to settle or win the case.

337
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,361
They promised to give me
something in return.

338
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,281
No wonder you're called the fixer.

339
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,277
Here is the next casting plan,

340
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,149
list of co-producing partners,

341
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:08,444
plans for multiple slots,

342
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:11,207
and contact information of new actors.

343
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,573
- Producer Gang.
- What now?

344
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:17,599
Mr. Firecracker was found at
the place you suggested,

345
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,892
and they are filming now.

346
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,965
But the next location fell through.
It's so frustrating.

347
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:23,973
Then ask the location manager.

348
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,628
We came up with a list,

349
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,213
but nothing seemed to work.

350
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,965
The producer doesn't like any of them.

351
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,291
What do you need?

352
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,973
We need to send a request
to the local authorities.

353
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,628
But you know how long it takes
to get it approved.

354
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:37,578
Can you touch it up to secure
a prompt confirmation?

355
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,587
Green Village in Woori City?

356
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,405
Chief Ko.

357
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:51,841
Would we have to work
with the Regional Tourism Team now?

358
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,957
What do you think?

359
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:56,583
I never see you working, anyway.

360
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,164
But how come it's us?

361
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:01,330
Why is it our team?

362
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,948
You're the reason why.

363
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,873
Me?

364
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,001
That's right.

365
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,904
Every time we make some headway,

366
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:11,233
you screw up the projects
for the whole team.

367
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:12,938
And despite your monthly apologies,

368
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,760
you keep making vigorous mistakes...

369
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,809
that have me running around
making excuses for you.

370
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,668
So, I can't get things done.

371
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,331
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:25,305
But what about your safety obsession?

373
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,840
You talk about how safety matters,

374
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,864
but all you do is play it safe
to avoid any risks.

375
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:33,354
Isn't that bureaucratic complacency,
which we should avoid?

376
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,088
With someone like you here,

377
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:37,195
we get called "corrupt" and "incompetent,"

378
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,546
and "a waste of tax money!"

379
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:44,105
All right.

380
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,775
As much as the environment
and facilities matter,

381
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:48,989
inspection is also important...

382
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:52,149
because that's how we ensure
that nothing goes wrong.

383
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,672
We start our work from there!

384
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:03,365
What!

385
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:11,266
- What's the matter?
- What is it?

386
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:14,274
For crying out loud.

387
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:20,907
What does he know?
He's still wet behind the ears.

388
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,272
I'll take them all down.

389
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,366
You crazy bastard.

390
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:29,549
Your shenanigan has killed so many.

391
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,255
What did you say?

392
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,277
With all those cats making a racket,

393
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,829
I can't get any sleep at night.

394
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,229
They wreck my crops during the day...

395
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:41,389
and knock over the trash for food.

396
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:43,676
How could you shoot arrows
at the stray cats?

397
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:46,252
You're evil using pesticides on them.

398
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:47,797
They are stray cats.

399
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,932
So just leave them to die.

400
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,013
What a heartless demon.

401
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,371
You're a monster!

402
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:56,470
I've had enough!

403
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,160
If you don't want them dead,

404
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,591
take all those cats from the village!

405
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:04,469
- Just leave!
- You can live with the rats.

406
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,397
Chief Ko.

407
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:08,938
Chief Ko.

408
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,039
Can you please do something?

409
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,052
What can I do?

410
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,325
You can either kick out this lady,

411
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,035
or try to persuade Mr. Heo.

412
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,588
Don't you see them bickering?

413
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,610
I've already explained it to them both.

414
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,630
You there, loser!

415
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:30,642
Why are you brushing me off?

416
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:34,587
"Civil officers shall serve the public."

417
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,700
That's in Article Seven of
the Constitution.

418
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,740
And I'm a law-abiding taxpayer.

419
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,499
So why aren't you taking me seriously?

420
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:46,066
Stop causing a commotion in the village.

421
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,050
What? Why you little...

422
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,265
- Please don't.
- Let go!

423
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:53,392
Look here, people like me give you work!

424
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,547
My tax money pays your wage!

425
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:59,449
But you're at your desk doing nothing!

426
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,415
Why can't we get an approval?

427
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,479
They seem to be tied up with work.

428
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,535
- I had no luck on the phone.
- That's a lame excuse.

429
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,627
Time is running out, so make it happen.

430
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:10,146
But how? They even blocked my call.

431
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,476
What's your plan?

432
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,212
We need it filmed before sundown
to get it running on air.

433
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:18,142
- Where is the email address?
- Right here.

434
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:36,645
(Gang Min Ju: Hello, I sent a request
regarding our shoot...)

435
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,888
What's this? We're busy enough already.

436
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:40,799
What's the matter?

437
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,529
Didn't you send a reply?

438
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,461
The filming authorization?
I turned them down.

439
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:50,964
Then what's this email?

440
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:57,358
What? It's a chance to produce results...

441
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:58,721
with my team's downtime?

442
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,848
This is ridiculous.

443
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:07,471
I'll somehow get our clearance,
so get right to it.

444
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:10,393
- All right.
- Make it count.

445
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,222
"Even if I'm doing nothing,"

446
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:26,186
"I couldn't care less about
your filming permit."

447
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:30,368
What's his problem?

448
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,393
So even if he is doing nothing,

449
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,649
he couldn't care less about it?

450
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,757
Did you get a reply? What does it say?

451
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:41,189
This guy doesn't even give a care.

452
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,508
What did you say in your email?

453
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,655
I wrote him in all politeness.

454
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:48,975
"Team's downtime."

455
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:52,430
What? I wrote that? No way.

456
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,561
Right here.

457
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,325
That's a typo.

458
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:58,598
"It's a chance to produce results..."

459
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,438
"with your team for a time."

460
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:03,565
But "team's downtime?"

461
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:05,886
This can't be true.

462
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:10,476
Get in his favor, okay?

463
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,533
You're good at that.

464
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,426
I must be crazy to mess this up.

465
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,256
"I apologize for my typo mistake."

466
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,098
"That's not what I meant."

467
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:30,384
(You received a new email.)

468
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:32,714
Typo? What a lousy excuse.

469
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,562
Why is he making such a fuss?

470
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,420
Just go ahead with the shoot.

471
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,031
What a senseless woman!

472
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,584
No filming crew, got it?

473
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:03,740
Yes, Chief Ko.

474
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,998
What does she take me for?

475
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,090
I'll find a way to make it work.

476
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,357
Chief Ko.

477
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,670
- What?
- It's about the filming.

478
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,840
I don't have the downtime
to deal with a solicitor.

479
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:43,736
Solicitor?

480
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:47,383
Hello?

481
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,503
I demand to talk with your boss.

482
00:26:50,503 --> 00:26:54,129
The solicitor from the SBC network
has something to say.

483
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:58,456
The chief won't be issuing
a clearance this time.

484
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:00,289
I'm sorry, next time...

485
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,707
Next time doesn't work for me.

486
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,827
I just need that man shouting
in the background.

487
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:05,748
Put him on the phone!

488
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:08,556
After being rude, irrational,

489
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,330
and mouthing off like a wreck,

490
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,273
you won't get clearance to film our site.

491
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,108
Is that clear? Good day.

492
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,965
What?

493
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:21,565
Did he hang up after ranting?

494
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,430
Darn it all.

495
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:27,619
My goodness.

496
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:30,538
Excuse me.

497
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,947
Have you been cleared to film?

498
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:35,089
You can't be doing this.

499
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,618
What's this about?

500
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:40,802
You see, this won't take long.

501
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:42,412
I'm SBC's Producer Nam Gi Cheol.

502
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:45,251
I'm Deputy Director Cha Su Hyeok.

503
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:49,274
Anyway, you'll have to apply for
clearance to film here.

504
00:27:49,274 --> 00:27:51,515
Let's have you leave now.

505
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:54,946
You didn't get an approval?

506
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,777
- Well, you see...
- Take care of it now.

507
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:00,212
Why mess it up? Hurry.

508
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,685
The filming crew pulled out.

509
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,973
What?

510
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:09,150
I got a call saying they were kicked out.

511
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,381
For crying out loud.

512
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:12,429
Just leave it.

513
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,505
You have to lose sometimes.

514
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:16,836
I can't believe that guy.

515
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:21,159
The trash drama press conference
was pushed to next week.

516
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,311
There is nothing trashy about it.

517
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:27,162
But they want a press release
issued by today.

518
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:31,264
Have you received any updated
scripts from Na Ae Ri?

519
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,547
Yes, right. I forgot.

520
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,712
- You haven't got it yet?
- Well, you see...

521
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:41,011
She'll soon send the revision.

522
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,687
Isn't this from early dawn?

523
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,958
The script just arrived.

524
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,051
Don't just stand there. Print it!

525
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,140
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,733
- Let me see it.
- My goodness.

527
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,043
(Woori City, a peaceful city of hope)

528
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,471
Okay, what drama stands out for you?

529
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:17,512
That has to be "Sandglass."

530
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:19,080
"Am I shaking right now?"

531
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,911
I'm surprised you know this classic.

532
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:21,942
It's a masterpiece.

533
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:24,014
For me, it's "Something Happened in Bali."

534
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:25,389
That's a true romance.

535
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,670
My favorite is "Lovers in Paris."

536
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,110
That was very popular.

537
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,771
- What about you?
- Mine is from another network.

538
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:32,929
That's okay. What is it?

539
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,062
It's K Network's "Paradise for Youth."

540
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,260
Is that right?

541
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,988
Producer Han directed it.

542
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,970
- Really?
- I see.

543
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,418
Yes, it's one of my dramas.

544
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:47,092
But why did you come here?

545
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:50,499
That's because SBC is better.

546
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,260
Your series had good ratings.

547
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,665
But why was it cut short?

548
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,814
Was it because of that incident...

549
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:56,990
Well, you see...

550
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,694
- Look, new kid.
- Yes, sir?

551
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:01,636
Why are you being so curious
like Thomas Edison?

552
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,656
- Boss.
- Boss.

553
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:13,895
Don't worry. I'm okay.

554
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:17,550
It's a dizzy spell.

555
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,100
(The cat lady has to go!)

556
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,996
Get out of my way!

557
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:45,920
My goodness!

558
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,527
Chief Ko.

559
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:52,597
What do you want?

560
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:54,767
I apologize for my outburst.

561
00:31:57,028 --> 00:32:00,831
Was that a payback for opposing
your bungee project?

562
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,335
Why would I hold a grudge...

563
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:07,048
Yes, I'm sorry.

564
00:32:14,214 --> 00:32:16,217
Hurry! Get out of here!

565
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:18,434
Over there!

566
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:19,556
The crazy guy!

567
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,093
All of you!

568
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:27,478
Where is the mayor? Get him out here!

569
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,619
Let me go, you bastard!

570
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:40,422
Get everyone out! Now!

571
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,059
Let go of me!

572
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:49,675
What are you doing? Talk to me.

573
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,406
Get lost! I want the mayor!

574
00:32:58,261 --> 00:32:59,468
Put this down first.

575
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:07,955
This won't resolve anything.
Get it together!

576
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,232
Who do you think you are?

577
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:13,034
You dog!

578
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
No!

579
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,872
Chief Ko!

580
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,672
Let me go!

581
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:03,816
I did nothing wrong!

582
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:08,812
Come on, relax.

583
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:11,118
Don't forget that Na Ae Ri
is new to screenplays.

584
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,348
Who cares? She's the writer!

585
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:14,634
She could jump off a building,

586
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:17,486
or even get suicidal and overdose.

587
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:19,226
If you don't want to attend her funeral,

588
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,553
don't be too hard on her.

589
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,498
I need the ER because of her.

590
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,894
Yes, so let's take deep breaths.

591
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,797
Okay.

592
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,694
Thank you.

593
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:39,642
You worked hard on this script.

594
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,306
It wasn't any trouble.

595
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:45,984
Writing is what makes me
feel alive and happy.

596
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,209
I appreciate the opportunity.

597
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:57,927
Yes, I enjoyed reading your script.

598
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:01,743
I'm flattered, but I have more to learn.

599
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:02,798
You're modest.

600
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:05,520
People online get excited
about your stories.

601
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,234
Now I understand why.

602
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:10,099
Really?

603
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,374
Yes.

604
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:15,168
You really have good taste.

605
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:18,750
My stories don't touch on
big events or crises.

606
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,039
That's right.

607
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,442
Speaking of which...

608
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:24,420
Yes, please talk freely.

609
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,780
I'll consider your preference.

610
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,262
My preference?

611
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:37,634
I agree that is important.

612
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,794
But how should I put it?

613
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:42,074
Freedom of speech is great and stuff,

614
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:46,658
but we can't acknowledge
everything out there.

615
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:47,658
Don't you agree?

616
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,588
I don't quite follow.

617
00:35:53,842 --> 00:35:57,746
I prefer to speak more bluntly.

618
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,887
Bluntly.

619
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,341
That's my point.

620
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,767
But why not write bluntly, then?

621
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:14,717
It's nice that you want to write
an unconventional story.

622
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,909
I get that.

623
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,367
But there should at least be some drama.

624
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,516
What are you even trying to say?

625
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:24,190
Your storyline is dull and unexciting.

626
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,367
It's not funny, sad, or scary.

627
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,647
I didn't feel a thing while reading it.

628
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,881
Not even one scene!

629
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:36,462
Is your female lead a prostitute?

630
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:37,711
She hits on everybody.

631
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,720
Is your male lead a robot?
He has no feelings.

632
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:45,915
Romantic comedies are a breeze to enjoy.

633
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:48,132
They may seem silly without much to them.

634
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:51,213
That could be why you got started.

635
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:53,124
Did you really think pretty faces...

636
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:56,199
bickering and smooching all day
make a great romantic comedy?

637
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:02,039
You know what?

638
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,991
I'm passionate about dramas.

639
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,008
When people watch what I produce,

640
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:10,567
they cry, laugh, take comfort,
forgive, and love.

641
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,463
That's why I give my all.

642
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,601
I've dedicated my life to it!

643
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,985
Your script...

644
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,394
It's like pollution.

645
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:25,987
Do you understand?

646
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,516
You can use dung as compost.

647
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,875
But there is no use for this trash.

648
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,362
- Boss.
- Boss.

649
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:10,290
Boss.

650
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:39,954
- What a cutie pie.
- Adorable.

651
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,462
What are you excited about?

652
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:52,018
Min Ju, my dog finally gave birth.

653
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:56,387
How adorable. Look at their paws!

654
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,902
Aren't they cute?

655
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:02,097
Her dog even has puppies,
but what about us?

656
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,607
When the nurse said her three sons...

657
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:06,998
and two daughters are all healthy,

658
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:08,910
I started crying like a baby.

659
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,583
Is that right?

660
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:15,343
It made me feel like a mom,
which was quite odd.

661
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,608
I felt acknowledged as an adult.

662
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,871
It felt good but also overwhelming.

663
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,095
You're all grown up, all right.

664
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:23,631
Your dog gave birth,

665
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:26,777
and now you're responsible
for five puppies.

666
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:32,798
What is it?

667
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:33,913
What's the matter?

668
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:42,255
My goodness, then what?

669
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,255
Are you pregnant?

670
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:46,489
- No.
- Then what is it?

671
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:49,636
It's probably...

672
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:53,386
I think it's menopause.

673
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,445
- What?
- My goodness.

674
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,142
- Your period is probably irregular.
- Yes, get it checked.

675
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:03,727
I feel like it's over for me as a woman.

676
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:08,951
I'm merely a person now.

677
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:12,046
Just an older grown-up.

678
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:15,838
No, a childlike adult.

679
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,431
All right, let's make a toast.

680
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:22,131
That's life.

681
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:23,399
There you have it.

682
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,193
Tears are coming out.

683
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:34,384
- Don't cry.
- Come on.

684
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:35,758
Is my womanhood...

685
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:38,522
coming to an end in life and love?

686
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,119
Even without realizing it,

687
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,968
I might have missed the chance
to love one last time.

688
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:52,687
- That's hilarious.
- Goodness.

689
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:57,042
Incoming patient!

690
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:09,980
I wonder where she lives.

691
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,901
- Is she single?
- Where does she live?

692
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:13,885
Doesn't she have a family?

693
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:16,189
Honey, isn't that our neighbor?

694
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:18,151
She must have been living alone.

695
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,807
(Speed Limit 30, Your Speed 75)

696
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:25,272
Have I kept a good pace in life?

697
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:26,272
Emergency patient!

698
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,923
Where did it all go wrong?

699
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:38,898
I've made countless choices.

700
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:41,977
What have I lost?

701
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,044
What have I gained?

702
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,746
Why am I alone now?

703
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,876
Every man is an island.

704
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:58,011
Is everyone bound to feel lonely
as a grown-up?

705
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:01,501
Loneliness comes to everyone.

706
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:08,577
We should have it removed.

707
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:13,831
Remove what? My breasts?

708
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:15,210
Or is it my uterus?

709
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,400
Emesis and acute abdomen?
It's cholelithiasis, right?

710
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,700
- Right.
- Look here.

711
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,209
It could be a cholesterol gallstone.

712
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,422
What does that mean?

713
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:25,783
Cholesterol? Is that my problem?

714
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,972
Let's wake you up. Gang Min Ju?

715
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:30,556
Can you hear me?

716
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:32,128
Bend your finger if you can.

717
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,545
We need to perform surgery
to remove a gallstone.

718
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,106
Take her to the OR immediately.

719
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,535
Is this how it all ends?

720
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:48,470
Am I done for?

721
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,536
Is it my breast or uterus?

722
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,158
(Woori City Hall)

723
00:43:57,158 --> 00:43:59,972
Chief Ko was rushed to the ER,

724
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:01,702
and there was a big scene.

725
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,558
I feel so bad for him.

726
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,055
That bastard...

727
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:08,343
I mean, what happened to that man?

728
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:11,775
The police took him away.
It was clearly arson.

729
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:13,515
Why aren't you working?

730
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:14,629
Chief Ko.

731
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,332
Chief Ko.

732
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:27,808
It's all my fault.

733
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:30,152
Are you certain you're okay?
Don't you need to rest?

734
00:44:30,152 --> 00:44:32,123
Be quiet. Check these files.

735
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:35,383
Good morning.

736
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:38,069
Come on, take your seats.

737
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,900
As you're all aware,

738
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,246
there was a startling incident
that took place here.

739
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:49,535
But Chief Ko came to the rescue
at that very moment,

740
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,391
which led to everyone being safe.

741
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:54,198
Since there is a tight grip
on the press release,

742
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:56,150
I ask for your cooperation.

743
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,178
He will also receive an award
from the Prime Minister.

744
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,096
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

745
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,248
Yes.

746
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:17,920
I'm all right.

747
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,144
I thought I was a goner.

748
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,446
Right now? I'm on my way to a shoot.

749
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:27,468
I can't believe you.

750
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:30,941
You just had your gallstone removed.

751
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:33,008
I told you to take a sick leave.

752
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:36,821
I can do without those dramas
if it means having you.

753
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,462
All right.

754
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:39,486
Okay.

755
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,670
Tae Yeon sent me a text.
Talk to you later.

756
00:45:45,614 --> 00:45:46,932
What did I tell you?

757
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:49,230
You should have attended
the divorcees' party.

758
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,501
Did you catch the news?

759
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,613
"A single woman in her 40s..."

760
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:54,111
"was found dead in her flat
after three days."

761
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,191
Do you want me to send pictures?

762
00:45:56,525 --> 00:45:58,376
(No thanks!)

763
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:05,201
It's me, your essay tutor.

764
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:17,365
Where are you? We're almost there.

765
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:20,668
I'm already here taking a stroll.

766
00:47:20,668 --> 00:47:22,268
Will it be okay?

767
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:24,341
I have your back, so just shoot.

768
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,843
There isn't anywhere better.

769
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,105
If you don't film today,
we won't be on air.

770
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:31,165
All right.

771
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:47,947
It's dreadfully hot.

772
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,066
This place still needs work,

773
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:16,203
but I'm glad you are benchmarking it.

774
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:17,412
Feel free to ask questions...

775
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:19,279
and enjoy looking around.

776
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:30,480
(Do not enter.)

777
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:43,952
I'm curious as to
what she is doing over there.

778
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:48,722
(Under Construction)

779
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:53,578
Is that a performance for welcoming us?

780
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:57,683
What the...

781
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,862
You can take them over there.

782
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:02,862
All right.

783
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:05,210
What is she doing?

784
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:13,064
My word.

785
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:21,120
What now?

786
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:23,612
Come out of there.

787
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:24,796
Come out.

788
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,595
- Come out here.
- Okay.

789
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:30,486
What are you doing in there?

790
00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:32,994
I'm sorry.

791
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:34,490
That apology doesn't cut it.

792
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,155
You'll get fined for doing this.

793
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:38,801
This fountain is for your eyes only.

794
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:40,937
It's not where you can waddle.

795
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,438
Don't you see the sign?

796
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:45,501
Even kids know better.

797
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:48,733
After hearing about this great place,

798
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:50,374
I got carried away.

799
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:55,415
What are you looking at?

800
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:58,676
I didn't see anything.

801
00:49:58,676 --> 00:49:59,720
My goodness.

802
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:04,533
You can't take showers here.

803
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:08,230
It doesn't hurt to dip your hands...

804
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,285
and your feet when passing by.

805
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,887
That is absolutely not allowed.

806
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,373
Do you own this place?

807
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:17,902
Yes, I'm the one who made it.

808
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:20,365
If you disturb the carp living here,

809
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,320
what do you think will happen?

810
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:25,094
After hearing about this place,

811
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:27,511
you're probably here for real estate.

812
00:50:31,038 --> 00:50:32,592
You wrecked the levee!

813
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,206
I barely touched it.

814
00:50:36,206 --> 00:50:37,687
For crying out loud.

815
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:40,214
It's me.

816
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:43,278
You know the fountain on top?
Replace the water.

817
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:45,254
This one crazy woman waddled in...

818
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:47,901
and even washed her hair.

819
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:49,318
She wrecked the levee.

820
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:51,295
Beats me.

821
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:54,317
Maybe she's a realtor, speculator,
or scammer from Seoul.

822
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,047
Anyway, she's drenched like a sewer rat.

823
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,650
- You!
- What on Earth?

824
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,956
You scared me!

825
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:05,769
Here.

826
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:10,473
Do you have a lap blanket?

827
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:12,411
Let's bring her the cloak.

828
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,439
You can cover up with this.

829
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:19,932
Thank you.

830
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:24,530
Why would you get mad for
getting mistaken as a realtor?

831
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:28,001
I don't know what brought you
here all by yourself,

832
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,077
but you should enjoy it quietly.

833
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:32,399
Do I need a reason to visit alone?

834
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:35,778
Look at you twisting everything I say.

835
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:37,942
What did you say?

836
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:39,342
That cloak you have there...

837
00:51:39,342 --> 00:51:41,869
is a special token for ladies
that come here alone.

838
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:44,737
So go ahead and enjoy it.

839
00:51:44,737 --> 00:51:45,884
Thanks.

840
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,128
I'm here alone, but I'm not really.

841
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:51,925
So there's no need to pity me.

842
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:57,857
What's up?

843
00:51:58,497 --> 00:52:01,171
What? Where?

844
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:02,412
Okay, I'll be there.

845
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,594
Make sure you return the towel
after drying your hair.

846
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:10,163
Stealing a public property will only
cause you embarrassment.

847
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:15,667
What a complete jerk.

848
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,030
For goodness' sake.

849
00:52:48,314 --> 00:52:49,390
Hop on.

850
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,548
The bus stop is far away
and cabs are rare.

851
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:56,079
No, it's okay. You keep going.

852
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:58,238
Were you at the arboretum?

853
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,541
That cloak is a children's gift.

854
00:53:06,794 --> 00:53:09,236
Are you sure you won't ride?

855
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:11,067
You'll catch a cold.

856
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,832
No, I'm good.

857
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:17,854
You'll regret it.

858
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:23,230
Just to the main street, then.

859
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:26,502
All right.

860
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:36,358
You'd fall off that way.

861
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,022
Okay, let's take off.

862
00:53:42,788 --> 00:53:43,788
My goodness!

863
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,182
From over there...

864
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:45,821
- Hello.
- I'm not here to greet you.

865
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:47,843
I said you can't film here.

866
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,950
You see, wait a minute.

867
00:54:50,684 --> 00:54:53,062
- Is this the guy?
- Yes.

868
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:55,068
What are you doing here?

869
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:56,553
Look.

870
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,315
You can't film here.

871
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:04,085
I'm sure it looks nice on the screen,

872
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:05,396
but listen to me.

873
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:08,052
Next year, it's to be designated
as a cultural heritage,

874
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:09,780
and we have tourists visiting.

875
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,106
With you taking up all the space,

876
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:13,549
they can't even take pictures.

877
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,615
What if something goes wrong here?

878
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:16,896
I apologize.

879
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,465
I know that it's a valuable heritage...

880
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,136
and that we need everyone's cooperation.

881
00:55:20,136 --> 00:55:21,988
There won't be any cooperating.

882
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,215
Chief Ko, calm down.

883
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:25,370
What's going on?

884
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:27,964
What? Producer Gang.

885
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,366
What's this cloak?

886
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:34,581
Anyway, you promised to have my back.

887
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,368
We're short on time, so I'll keep rolling.

888
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:38,846
Who might you be?

889
00:55:38,846 --> 00:55:41,201
I'm the chief producer of this crew.

890
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:45,383
I'm SBC's producer Gang Min Ju.

891
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:48,758
What a senseless woman!

892
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,399
No filming crew, got it?

893
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:52,454
I just need that man shouting
in the background.

894
00:55:52,454 --> 00:55:54,506
Put him on the phone!

895
00:55:56,647 --> 00:55:57,808
The one in charge?

896
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,806
Then let's see you take charge.

897
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:05,562
Do you think you can do anything...

898
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,107
just because you have money and land?

899
00:56:08,107 --> 00:56:10,363
- The arboretum might be yours...
- He's the chief.

900
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:12,773
Chief Ko Sang Sik of
the Environment Facilities Team.

901
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:16,841
After being rude, irrational,
and mouthing off,

902
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:19,830
you won't get clearance to film our site.

903
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,650
Is that clear? Good day.

904
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:27,631
Were you the one who sent me the email?

905
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:30,103
Listen, crazy lady.

906
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:33,524
I don't need to produce results
with my team's downtime.

907
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:34,767
So pull out now.

908
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:37,432
- I can't do that.
- What?

909
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,832
You've not been cleared to film, so leave.

910
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,664
That's not going to happen.

911
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:44,728
What a reckless woman!

912
00:56:44,728 --> 00:56:46,545
You, mister.

913
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:49,681
I mean, Chief Ko. Hear me out first.

914
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,312
Mister? I've had it with you!

915
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:56,471
Before I sue you for illegal filming,

916
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,592
leave this site immediately!

917
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,414
(Approved for filming on location.)

918
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,475
What?

919
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:14,138
But how...

920
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,138
Start rolling.

921
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:20,632
Producer Gang does it again.

922
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:24,140
Gang Min Ju!

923
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,541
Let's start filming.

924
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:32,977
What are you saying?

925
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:35,065
I wasn't informed of your decision.

926
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:36,361
And this is definitely...

927
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:39,225
a great inconvenience for
our visiting tourists.

928
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:41,072
I ask that you have them leave.

929
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:43,488
Haven't you watched their series?

930
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:45,752
I don't watch dramas.

931
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:48,502
Their viewership is pretty high.

932
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,335
The drama could give us a chance...

933
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,334
to promote our heritage site.

934
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:54,302
That can draw in more tourists.

935
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,079
There are other ways of promoting.

936
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,710
Like what?

937
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,527
Handing out flyers to tourists...

938
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:01,577
and hanging posters around?

939
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:04,910
I get that it's your style,

940
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,285
but give some dramas a try.

941
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:11,161
They can offer solace from busy work,

942
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:14,394
and while they enable mindless watching,
they offer food for thought.

943
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:16,494
It's a pretty decent pastime.

944
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,730
All right?

945
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:40,677
Cut!

946
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:43,344
Please let me down!

947
00:58:43,344 --> 00:58:44,429
Let's take a five.

948
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:48,698
After all that trouble getting
the male lead here,

949
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,794
now the female lead acts up.

950
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:52,860
There's no time for stand-ins.

951
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,630
The actor should do this much.

952
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,815
It's safe!

953
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:56,834
Come with me.

954
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:02,521
Please let me down!

955
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:05,600
Here, hold my hand.

956
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,465
No, I want to get back down.

957
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,847
Don't look down.

958
00:59:11,847 --> 00:59:14,738
I'm so terrified.

959
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:17,167
Close your eyes. You're an actress.

960
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:19,727
Making it this far means
you've done it all.

961
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:21,223
I can't do this.

962
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:22,385
I really can't.

963
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:25,557
Are you asking to be bashed
with slapped-on CGI?

964
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:27,064
Is that what you want?

965
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,910
No.

966
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,989
Good.

967
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:34,510
- I'll do this.
- All right.

968
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,477
- I'll do this.
- All right.

969
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:37,809
Let's do this.

970
00:59:44,277 --> 00:59:48,008
Are you sure it won't kill me?

971
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:49,530
Of course not.

972
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:55,595
Look how sturdy this is. Come on!

973
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:59,404
Watching someone else jump
will help me do it.

974
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:00,454
Are you sure?

975
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:08,008
For crying out loud.

976
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:12,134
Get me the gear.

977
01:00:16,853 --> 01:00:19,260
Are you sure this is safe?

978
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,972
So now you choose to ask that?

979
01:00:20,972 --> 01:00:23,469
The government guy Cha Su Hyeok

980
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:24,884
came by to brag about it.

981
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:26,548
Despite holding back our permit,

982
01:00:26,548 --> 01:00:27,884
he was set on promoting it.

983
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:28,884
Okay.

984
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:31,068
Have you done it before?

985
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:33,838
Are you nuts? Who has the time?

986
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:36,852
Get her ready when I jump.

987
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:37,852
Okay.

988
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:43,335
Wait, why is this uncomfortable?

989
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:47,238
What about this one?

990
01:00:48,731 --> 01:00:50,955
Get ready. Okay?

991
01:00:50,955 --> 01:00:53,746
Okay, gear up.

992
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,824
What are you doing there?

993
01:00:58,093 --> 01:00:59,574
We're filming.

994
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:02,374
But we haven't checked to see
if the facility can run.

995
01:01:02,374 --> 01:01:03,964
We're on top of it all.

996
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:06,692
- So get on your way.
- What?

997
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:08,273
Look, get ready.

998
01:01:11,927 --> 01:01:13,134
Gang Min Ju.

999
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:16,836
Life for me has been a struggle,

1000
01:01:16,836 --> 01:01:18,975
and I gave it everything.

1001
01:01:25,757 --> 01:01:26,880
Are you ready?

1002
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,333
Let's do this, then.

1003
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,304
See how it's done.

1004
01:01:35,294 --> 01:01:37,340
Although I will remain alone,

1005
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:41,234
I'll still love myself...

1006
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:44,620
enough to live well and be in good health.

1007
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,585
I make that promise to you, Gang Min Ju.

1008
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:49,210
Goodness.

1009
01:01:56,262 --> 01:01:57,589
Get ready.

1010
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:02,512
Five, four, three, two, one.

1011
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,862
- What?
- Boss!

1012
01:02:50,286 --> 01:02:51,353
Producer Gang!

1013
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,187
Darn it!

1014
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:40,885
(Second to Last Love)

1015
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:42,721
I moved today.

1016
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:44,469
- How is your neighbor?
- Let's celebrate.

1017
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:46,924
There is a young and sweet guy.

1018
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,253
Bribery and misconduct.

1019
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:51,525
The bureaucrat is completely rogue.

1020
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:52,687
Good morning.

1021
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:54,686
Come on in.

1022
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:56,638
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

1023
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:57,638
Do you know each other?

1024
01:03:57,638 --> 01:04:00,312
I hope you don't have things
that fall or break off.

1025
01:04:00,312 --> 01:04:01,459
Somebody help!

1026
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:03,756
I've been locked in!

1027
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,798
