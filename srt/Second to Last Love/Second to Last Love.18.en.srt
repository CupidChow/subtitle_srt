1
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:07,270
We trusted in Woori City's endorsement...

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,214
and paid the tuition fees to the schools,

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,366
but our kids aren't even on their list.

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,343
We came after checking early,

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:18,254
but they were still distributing flyers
at the subway station.

6
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,822
Where is this agency?

7
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,913
It's behind Cheongrim Station,
but this morning,

8
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,359
their doors were locked,
and they weren't answering calls.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,302
Isn't this a scam?

10
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:30,129
This must be a complete scam.

11
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,566
Yes?

12
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,800
I got a flyer at Cheongrim Station.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,920
It even features your photo...

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,008
and claims that you developed
this study program.

15
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,008
Is that true?

16
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,303
Hello? What's that noise?

17
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:49,506
I'll call you back later.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,887
Chief Ko, you need to handle this.

19
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,665
I don't know why my photo is on the flyer.

20
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,753
But what's clear is that our city...

21
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,121
never had a hand in this study program.

22
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,535
- That's absurd.
- I can't believe this.

23
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:02,623
Just a second.

24
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:05,510
Report it to the police station
if this affects you.

25
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,320
I'll also look into the matter.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,247
Take it to the police?

27
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:11,313
You've got to sort this out.

28
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:13,656
The city has got to step in.

29
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,984
How could this even happen?

30
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:19,524
This is crazy.
Report it to the police station?

31
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:21,369
It's on you to fix this.

32
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,682
You've got to sort it out.

33
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:26,949
This is insane. What now?

34
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:31,819
(Second to Last Love)

35
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:36,209
Why is our city believed to have
endorsed a study program?

36
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,009
I've received calls from the police,

37
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,169
and there are complaints from locals.

38
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,833
What's the deal here?

39
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,937
It seems a study program agency
stole my identity...

40
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,474
and capitalized on my public position.

41
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,898
How did this even happen?

42
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,825
Unless Chief Ko was directly involved,

43
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,882
they probably exploited his known face...

44
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,383
to gain trust in their business.

45
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,936
I've heard of these scams
popping up lately,

46
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,487
but I never thought our city
would get entangled in any.

47
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,690
They are investigating the case,
so let's see how it unfolds.

48
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,281
Folks who trusted Chief Ko for loans...

49
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,026
must be hit hard by this incident.

50
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,794
This isn't great for our city's image.

51
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:17,300
And you're still under investigation
regarding the ferry issue.

52
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,475
Sang Hee.

53
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,185
Yes?

54
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,760
Are you going somewhere?

55
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:41,791
Do you have some time?

56
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,808
What's it about?

57
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:52,208
This here.

58
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,272
Isn't this a study program abroad?

59
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:01,441
What? Is this the same agency?

60
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,036
I think so.

61
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:06,699
Is Chief Ko doing another project?

62
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,050
I gave him a call about it before,

63
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,722
but he was too busy to talk.

64
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,499
No.

65
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:16,739
I was preparing to send my son
abroad to study,

66
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,284
but it seems they used my brother
and ran off with the money.

67
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:24,475
What?

68
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,636
A study program fraud...

69
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,307
tied to the Regional Tourism Team?

70
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:32,420
Using Chief Ko's identity?

71
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,868
We can't catch a break, can we?

72
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,058
Chief Ko.

73
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:38,955
- Chief.
- Chief.

74
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:39,955
Are you busy right now?

75
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,071
No, it's okay.

76
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,778
You called about the flyer earlier.

77
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,375
Yes, I think it's a scam.

78
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,919
Exactly.

79
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,456
I somehow got mixed up in this,
but don't worry.

80
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,999
I don't want to worry either,

81
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,633
but there is something
I should tell you about it.

82
00:03:58,465 --> 00:03:59,555
What?

83
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,985
Sang Hee, where have you been?

84
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,163
Someone has stolen Sang Sik's identity.

85
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,170
What?

86
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,466
It seems a study program agency
used his good image as a civil servant...

87
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,298
and tried to promote their scam.

88
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:16,201
Why does this keep happening to him?

89
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,907
What should we do?

90
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,722
That's why I told our neighbor...

91
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:21,802
Never mind.

92
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,917
What? Are you blaming her for this?

93
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,452
No.

94
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,689
What's going on?

95
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,275
Is she crying? What's wrong?

96
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,598
Mi Rye, what are we going to do?

97
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,126
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

98
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,327
This is because of me.

99
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:47,795
What if something happens to Sang Sik?

100
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,394
What are you saying?

101
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,862
How is Sang Hee tied up with the agency?

102
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,386
You can't get worked up about it.

103
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,540
We can handle this calmly, okay?

104
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,341
All right.

105
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:05,954
Did Sang Hee sign up with them?

106
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:06,954
Tell me she didn't.

107
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:09,962
She did.

108
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,020
Are you serious?

109
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,652
She believes that is behind
your identity theft.

110
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,311
Feeling lost, she turned to me for advice.

111
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:20,831
I told her you should be informed,
and we should discuss it.

112
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,442
For crying out loud.

113
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,539
This is why she couldn't tell you...

114
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,290
and turned to me for help.

115
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,671
You promised not to get worked up.

116
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,472
How am I supposed to stay calm?

117
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,183
Why did she even go there?

118
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,898
None of this would've happened
if Sang Hee hadn't.

119
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,538
She didn't get a loan, did she?

120
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,512
- No.
- Are you sure about that?

121
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:45,422
Yes, she only did the paperwork.

122
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:47,917
How did she think she could afford it?

123
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:51,249
Sang Hee must have wrestled with it.

124
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,403
Every parent worries about
their kid's education.

125
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,847
But why didn't she consult me first?

126
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:01,242
She tried talking to you multiple times,

127
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,851
but you always brushed her off.

128
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:04,890
Yes, wanting to send Hun abroad,

129
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,363
she asked me about getting a loan.

130
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:07,923
That went on repeatedly.

131
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,267
Worried about troubling you,

132
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,707
she asked me to smooth things over
with you.

133
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:14,372
That means she feels bad and distraught.

134
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,004
So, let's keep calm.

135
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:22,746
Sorting it out should come first.

136
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,858
After appealing about your demotion,

137
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,297
the result isn't out yet.

138
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:30,353
So I'm worried it could backfire on you.

139
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:32,912
I found out quickly, thanks to you.

140
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,234
If not, she wouldn't have told me.

141
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,505
- Boss.
- Yes?

142
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,752
Producer Nam is asking for you.

143
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,025
Okay, I'll be there.

144
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:48,687
You get back to work.

145
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,247
I'll have a word with my sister.

146
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:53,647
Please try to be understanding.

147
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,647
All right.

148
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,194
Thanks.

149
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:08,183
Trainees have to skip school often...

150
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:10,230
and live at the dorm?

151
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,605
Yes, that's why we need parental consent.

152
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,212
If you're serious, talk it over
with your father...

153
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:17,445
and bring back this form signed.

154
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,343
Yes, all right.

155
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,916
Ye Ji, are you really going to?

156
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,965
After coming here, I want it even more.

157
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,688
What's the point?

158
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:30,040
I doubt your dad would approve.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,819
That's why I'm worried.

160
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,647
How can you be a top student
and so talented?

161
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:36,368
So, you don't like it?

162
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:39,055
We can't hang out when you train,

163
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:40,627
and I'd miss you being apart.

164
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,377
So I'm not thrilled.

165
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:44,955
But I want to give it a shot.

166
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,226
Even if I end up quitting,

167
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,068
when would I ever get such a chance?

168
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:54,593
You told them that I'm a public servant...

169
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,873
with the Regional Tourism Team?

170
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,925
Yes, I'm sorry.

171
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:02,566
I have no excuse to give you.

172
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,130
Are you positive there was no loan?

173
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:10,048
I only filled out the paperwork.

174
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,558
Then all of this went down.

175
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,770
How were you going to pay it back?

176
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:16,232
Because of what you told them,

177
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,287
do you realize how many are in trouble?

178
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,455
How could she have known
it'd turn out this way?

179
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:24,160
Yes, she almost got into trouble.

180
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,325
I'm back.

181
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,078
Ye Ji, you're home.

182
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,300
What? Did something happen?

183
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,075
No, it's nothing.

184
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,243
Don't think about sending Hun abroad,

185
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:36,338
and return home immediately.

186
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:39,964
Work it out with your husband
or do whatever you need.

187
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,613
How could you cause such trouble
after leaving him in his care?

188
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,018
All right.

189
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,391
Something must be up.

190
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,254
You don't need to know.

191
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,527
Dad.

192
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,671
Never mind. We can talk later.

193
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,197
This is impressive.

194
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,988
Since you didn't like the locations,

195
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,884
I've drafted a new list after review.

196
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,722
So don't get sidetracked
but focus on the shoots, okay?

197
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:14,507
All right. Thank you.

198
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:19,301
Did you go over all this with Chief Ko?

199
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,143
Yes.

200
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,831
How are the writers coming along?

201
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,639
I can't connect with Ms. Na.

202
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,758
But Ms. Ko is right up my alley.

203
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:33,839
She is my type.

204
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,934
Then why don't you marry her?

205
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,216
- Yes, I want to.
- What?

206
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:41,631
They got paired
for their different styles.

207
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,294
After blending their strengths,

208
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:45,800
you could get a stellar script.

209
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,974
Gi Cheol, that's on you.

210
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:48,178
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,783
But what's this noise?

212
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:57,050
I think it's the air conditioning.

213
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,418
Did you turn on the air conditioner?

214
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:01,162
Yes, having a river view is nice,

215
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:03,484
but it gets too humid here.

216
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,098
And it's worse at night.

217
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,747
- Then, I'll take off now.
- Okay.

218
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:10,958
- Work hard.
- Okay, take care.

219
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,958
All right.

220
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:30,007
Don't make your confession.

221
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,462
Even if you liked me first,

222
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,232
I want to be the one to say it.

223
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:38,399
How long is it going to take?

224
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,682
A day? A month? A year?

225
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,712
Mi Rye.

226
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,566
What?

227
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,842
Come and help me.

228
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:53,707
Yes, okay.

229
00:10:58,553 --> 00:10:59,825
Is work coming along okay?

230
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,218
It's going okay.

231
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,032
Take this.

232
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,008
Are you feeling awkward?

233
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,008
Nope.

234
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,900
I find you awkward this way.

235
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,311
Does it feel weird?

236
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,728
Yes.

237
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,713
Honestly, after opening up to you,

238
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:26,474
I feared things could change between us.

239
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,987
How about we do something fun tomorrow?

240
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,873
- Really?
- Yes.

241
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,720
Think of a place you want to visit.

242
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,192
Okay.

243
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,277
Is it for there?

244
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,251
Here.

245
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:48,910
Why? Are you still anxious?

246
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,295
I'm just really sorry.

247
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,761
It's okay.

248
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:57,840
When you wanted the lease money back,

249
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,151
it was the paperwork that got in the way.

250
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,169
But now, you're lending me
money for that loan.

251
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,712
It's not because I have plenty.

252
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,951
I've been saving it up for some time.

253
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,319
Yes, of course.

254
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,582
Thirty thousand dollars
isn't pocket change,

255
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,895
and the network doesn't pay you much.

256
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,246
Even if you're family,

257
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:22,366
you shouldn't take out a loan
without him knowing.

258
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,759
You should've consulted him first.

259
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,926
Tell me about it.

260
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:31,463
My brother was absolutely against it,

261
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,022
so I didn't have the nerve.

262
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,479
But from here on out,

263
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,894
I won't ever do this again.

264
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:41,918
Start by settling the public loan...

265
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,478
under your brother's name.

266
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:45,375
And seeing that you're a victim,

267
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,391
let's hope the scammers get caught soon.

268
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,928
They're bound to, still in the country.

269
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:54,951
Thank you.

270
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,104
This means the world.

271
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,341
My husband and family don't get me,

272
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,671
but you're so considerate.

273
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,952
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

274
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:13,729
I hope it gets better with your husband.

275
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:18,160
It's not as if he's a stranger to me.

276
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,238
I trust that nothing went on
even with your friend.

277
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:25,333
But after marrying for love,

278
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,038
this betrayal is just heartbreaking.

279
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:31,510
I've given everything for my family,

280
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,653
always going the extra mile,

281
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:37,596
but to be criticized for all that...

282
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:42,902
Your husband will come to understand.

283
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,373
Come on, let's get up.

284
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,009
Dad.

285
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,244
Yes. Hello, son.

286
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,606
I miss Mom.

287
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,017
You do?

288
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,348
Don't you miss her?

289
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,829
Why should I after twenty years?

290
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,330
It's her who kept us okay all this time.

291
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,058
Do you think it's been okay?

292
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,587
She pulled money from friends
to start a business,

293
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,937
what with cosmetics, water purifiers,

294
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,066
and health supplements, but lost it all.

295
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,963
That was to pay for my cram school.

296
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,225
Do you think that's a joke?

297
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,394
Is that right?

298
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:23,266
Then why didn't you hit the books sooner?

299
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,548
Let's bring her home.

300
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,945
I have something to work out.

301
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:31,945
Like what?

302
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,478
My feelings.

303
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,877
Who's been messing with my old man?

304
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,998
Good heavens.

305
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:43,170
I'll think about it after this problem.

306
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,037
Just remember that Mom was lonely.

307
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,266
How would you even know that?

308
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm her son.

309
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,997
I should notice,
even if her husband is blind to it.

310
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,782
She's been there for us.

311
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:14,963
You don't have to see me off.

312
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:17,048
- What are you doing here?
- Sang Sik.

313
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,868
I'm visiting since she's a neighbor.

314
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,797
- Have a good night.
- Okay.

315
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,723
- Wait.
- Sleep well.

316
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,132
What was that about?

317
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:30,470
It's nothing.

318
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:32,884
Are you sure it's nothing?

319
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,303
She's distraught about everything.

320
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,492
Goodness.

321
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,334
Sang Hee has been through a lot.

322
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,131
After our parents died early,

323
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:50,741
she devoted everything to the family.

324
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,986
After she got married,

325
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,997
I thought she was doing well.

326
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,906
That must be why it hurts more...

327
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,222
and breaks her heart.

328
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:01,867
Right.

329
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:07,116
I wish my family would stand
on their own now.

330
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:12,683
What would you do without
your whole world?

331
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,066
I should live my own life.

332
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,548
I've met someone special.

333
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:20,346
Ye Ji still has growing up to do.

334
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,185
Don't you know her?

335
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,521
She can manage fine on her own.

336
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,891
But she's still young.

337
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:29,117
She might need her dad
for another ten years.

338
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:32,503
Do you want to wait for ten years?

339
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,420
Wait for what?

340
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,919
We should either tie the knot
or share a life.

341
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,023
Why?

342
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:44,314
I'm okay with living next door.

343
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,333
I don't want that.

344
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,930
- What?
- I want to wake up together,

345
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,398
sleep together,

346
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:55,823
eat together, and travel together.

347
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:57,186
I want to share those moments.

348
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:00,403
Because of you.

349
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,952
I feel the same way.

350
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,929
It feels so relaxing this way.

351
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:28,282
That's why we're meant to be.

352
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,059
I've been losing sleep from the stress.

353
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,051
That's not good.

354
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,566
Should I lull you to sleep?

355
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,655
How about this?

356
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,841
Let's move in together.

357
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,437
What?

358
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,993
Separate but together.

359
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,019
What?

360
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:57,787
Being separate
and yet feeling connected...

361
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:00,318
is such a beautiful sentiment.

362
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,673
Why do we have to be separate?

363
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,505
Are you hiding a child or something?

364
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:07,865
No, it's not like that.

365
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:10,884
Living together comes with restraints.

366
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:15,132
I wish someone would tie me down.

367
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:18,745
It would get tiring.

368
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:20,360
Separate but together...

369
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,590
is better for the long haul.

370
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,749
Is that what you have pictured?

371
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:29,301
Did you think we'd get married?

372
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,794
My kids have grown up to find their way,

373
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:35,420
so why should I hesitate to tie the knot?

374
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:39,264
Whoever is left behind
must clean up after the one left.

375
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,348
So, being afraid to cope,

376
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,761
you think it's a hassle to care?

377
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,193
Nobody knows who might go first,

378
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,521
but we can't leave side by side.

379
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,709
I've misread you all along.

380
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,661
I'm out of here.

381
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,967
There now, come on.

382
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,195
Dokgo Bong, are you okay?

383
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,449
My goodness.

384
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,763
You can't breathe.

385
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:06,909
Please be okay.

386
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,881
Are you all right?

387
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,857
My goodness!

388
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:14,107
Have some water.

389
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,410
Goodness me!

390
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,816
You scared me so much.

391
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,710
You scared me.

392
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,636
So what place? Have you thought about it?

393
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,900
Well, it's been on my mind,

394
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,892
but I can't pin down a place.

395
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,675
It's because you haven't dated.

396
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:43,843
Date?

397
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,891
That place we visited with the family.

398
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,038
- How about we go there?
- No.

399
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,709
How about that rafting we did with Ye Ji?

400
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,117
- You want to go there?
- No.

401
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,117
Then what?

402
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:54,945
Not something we did with the family.

403
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,713
I want it to be special for just us two.

404
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,769
Don't we have places like that?

405
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,947
We've only been to the stable.

406
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:07,898
So you want something extra special?

407
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,819
- Yes.
- Okay, I got it.

408
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,335
It's Producer Nam.

409
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,335
Take it.

410
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,427
Hello?

411
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,291
What? Right now?

412
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:27,916
Okay.

413
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,420
Producer Oh. Hello.

414
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:39,212
I'm with Mi Rye.

415
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,900
Right.

416
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,844
All right, then.

417
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:44,889
Okay.

418
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,915
Have you been asked to come now?

419
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,957
Yes.

420
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,093
Let's just get to work.

421
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:54,934
What's this? It's so annoying.

422
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:58,611
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,652
Welcome.

424
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,892
- I'm sorry to call you over.
- It's okay.

425
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:03,745
Everyone is here for duty.

426
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,891
Are your shoots coming along?

427
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:07,020
Of course, it's going smoothly.

428
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,234
We need to revise the story
with location changes.

429
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,862
And since we have food scenes
to prepare for tomorrow,

430
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:15,085
we could use more information
about the dishes picked.

431
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,397
Is that right?

432
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:18,662
But weren't you two out together?

433
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:21,706
Yes.

434
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,530
I must have disturbed you.

435
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:26,745
Ms. Ko, I've missed you a lot.

436
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,727
But we talked on the phone
about the script.

437
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,095
Don't even get me started.

438
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:35,936
Producer Nam complained about
how we don't click.

439
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,600
He might ask for your hand
if you stick around.

440
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,922
Ask for my hand?

441
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,200
Shall we get started?

442
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,328
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:48,394
Let's hurry up and have a team dinner.

444
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,564
Really?

445
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:53,970
Yes, Detective Gang.

446
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,755
What happens to the people
scammed by the agency?

447
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,683
Then, they must be caught.

448
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,274
I appreciate your efforts.

449
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:05,976
You have a lot on your plate.

450
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,768
Here are the ferry bidding papers.

451
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,249
Thanks.

452
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:11,439
But why even meet with contractors...

453
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,968
that lost out in the bidding?

454
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:16,088
I'm trying to find out the real face...

455
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:18,506
of the winning contractor.

456
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:21,465
The name listed doesn't match up.

457
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,563
So you're tracking down the guy
who gained from the deal?

458
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:27,116
- Yes.
- Chief Ko.

459
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,065
These are all the grape importers...

460
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:31,920
that supply to our city.

461
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,370
But these three seem a bit odd.

462
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,370
How so?

463
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,937
While the importers are similar in size,

464
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:43,837
these three show inconsistency
in their annual sales.

465
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:47,772
They experience spikes in some years
and sharp declines in others.

466
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,616
You've got a point. Thanks.

467
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:52,969
Don't mention it.

468
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,510
What with the grape festival,

469
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,473
I hope those who switched imports
with local grapes get caught.

470
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,976
With your help, that's bound to happen.

471
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,934
Hello.

472
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,731
- I'm Ko Sang Sik.
- Nice to meet you.

473
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,037
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

474
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:26,292
After losing the ferry bid,

475
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,948
you must have felt hard done by.

476
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,685
No doubt.

477
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,037
Nobody expected that it would win.

478
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:37,845
Do you know anything about
who was representing it?

479
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,821
The word is, after going bankrupt,

480
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,029
he took off abroad and returned later.

481
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,901
I've been told he has switched
to another industry.

482
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:46,950
What industry?

483
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:03,132
It's me. Are you busy?

484
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:05,266
No, what about you?

485
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:08,307
We're going to a team dinner
after our meeting.

486
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,635
Really? I'm jealous.

487
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,530
If you have time,

488
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,619
you should bring your team along.

489
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,175
So you miss my team and not me?

490
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,577
I said you should bring them along.

491
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:24,811
Maybe you're too shy to invite me alone.

492
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:27,836
No, what's that nonsense?

493
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,082
All right.

494
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:33,426
I'll call you after making one more stop.

495
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:37,186
And I'll bring my team if possible.

496
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,614
Goodness.

497
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,538
All right.

498
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,522
I'll see you later.

499
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:50,586
Thank you for coming.

500
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,489
Is it about Director Shin Seok Gi?

501
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:56,007
Yes.

502
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:59,414
I swear, that man is the worst.

503
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,910
- What?
- If you must know,

504
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,781
I was only following company orders.

505
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:07,363
But someone from the city found out...

506
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,260
about the switched grapes.

507
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,907
Saying he was being blackmailed,

508
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:14,276
he demanded more money to shut it up.

509
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,739
And?

510
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:19,552
We got ripped off again.

511
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,422
The company sold all the stocks,

512
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:25,279
but what's the use
if it was such a huge loss?

513
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:37,611
Dokgo Bong!

514
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,322
Why are you calling me that?

515
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:44,251
When we're biking, it's James!

516
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,355
All right, James!

517
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:48,154
James!

518
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:51,006
Hold on tight, Christina!

519
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,663
- This is the best!
- What fun!

520
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:09,642
What do you think?

521
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:11,318
Don't you feel alive again?

522
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,230
You're the one who nearly died.

523
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,412
I know that seeing me in that condition...

524
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,256
almost broke you, didn't it?

525
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:25,507
Forget marriage. I want you alive, okay?

526
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,484
Come to me, Chun Woo.

527
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:31,756
My spring drizzle.

528
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:35,849
After seeing your reaction that day,

529
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:39,336
my love for you has deepened.

530
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:43,464
The fear of suddenly losing you...

531
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:46,708
has made me more desperate to love...

532
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,900
and cherish each day.

533
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:53,555
I feel as if I'm reborn.

534
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,612
Thank you for returning to me.

535
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,471
I have a headache

536
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,817
My nose is running

537
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,910
Today has been full of surprises.

538
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,030
You know how life never sticks
to the plans.

539
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,503
That's what makes it interesting.

540
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:29,699
I can't keep her all to myself

541
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,224
What's going on?

542
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,311
Oh, happy, boom

543
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:35,409
Mi Rye, let's dance.

544
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,450
Hurry.

545
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:44,688
I want to see you time and again

546
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:46,204
To my blushing girl

547
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,889
Jun Woo, you should sing.

548
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,233
No.

549
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:53,355
Mi Rye has feelings for you, right?

550
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:57,459
You should sing for her.

551
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,089
Then shall I?

552
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,226
Boom

553
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:05,554
Give me a big hand. Thank you.

554
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:07,948
Gi Cheol, hurry back now.

555
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:08,948
Get back here.

556
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:13,093
Why? I'm all excited.

557
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,117
Are you hogging the mic today?

558
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:17,501
I'll sing the next song.

559
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,045
What got you to even sing?

560
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:22,949
You come here.

561
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,482
It was a lonely alley

562
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:35,690
Do you remember?

563
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:41,188
I remember it even now

564
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:46,842
Holding back my love

565
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:50,538
All those anxious days

566
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:55,899
Did you know about it?

567
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:01,945
Back in our childhood days

568
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:05,298
The nights were beautiful

569
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:10,684
And my love remains

570
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:15,698
My childish friend

571
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:20,013
Everything about me

572
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:23,023
- Are you trying to take?
- Are you trying to take?

573
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:26,155
- My heartless love
- My heartless love

574
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:31,526
- Were you too shy to talk?
- Were you too shy to talk?

575
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,782
- Did you not like me?
- Did you not like me?

576
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:39,995
- I'm still waiting for you
- I'm still waiting for you

577
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:17,390
Did you get anything on him?

578
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,669
Of course, you know me.

579
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:23,480
Demoting Ko Sang Sik won't cut it.

580
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,244
It's going to blow up, wait and see.

581
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:30,716
Gang Min Ju seems really into him.

582
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:34,817
If they end up getting married,

583
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:36,570
I would lose my mind.

584
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,347
Then why didn't you act sooner?

585
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,638
She's a tough nut to crack.

586
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,703
And I love her for it.

587
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,196
We should do away with Ko Sang Sik...

588
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,501
to clear up all this mess.

589
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:57,100
Can you even get him fired?

590
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,268
Of course.

591
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,230
That's why I came to Woori City.

592
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:03,869
Okay, I'm counting on you.

593
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,707
My word, what brings you here?

594
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,640
Who do we have here?

595
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,943
- Hello.
- Hello.

596
00:31:13,943 --> 00:31:16,200
- What are you doing here?
- For a team dinner.

597
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,046
Really? When does it end?

598
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,969
Why?

599
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,435
Why do you think?

600
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,313
To grab drinks with my buddy.

601
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:24,588
Why don't you join us?

602
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:27,287
Maybe I should.

603
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:28,684
No.

604
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:32,642
Don't do it on my account.

605
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:36,093
Goodness. Were you with him?

606
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,749
You can leave if you're done talking.

607
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,266
Maybe next time.

608
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:41,070
Let's head out for now.

609
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:50,067
What took you so long?

610
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:51,363
Did things go well at work?

611
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:52,363
If I hadn't come here,

612
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,548
were you going to drink with them?

613
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:56,898
What's the big deal about that?

614
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,158
I can't believe how
you would take the risk.

615
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,004
Why would it matter?

616
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,191
You should know your enemy to beat him.

617
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:06,863
That's not necessary.

618
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:08,855
I don't want my girl turning into a spy,

619
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,096
so don't you ever do that again.

620
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,209
When are you dealing with Director Shin?

621
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:16,654
I'm close to handling it.

622
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:19,863
What about your team?

623
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,037
So I'm not the only one you missed?

624
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:26,124
I did, that's why I called.

625
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,382
Because I want to be with you.

626
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,829
They're already in there having fun.

627
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,384
Shall we head in?

628
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:36,655
It's okay, come here.

629
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:44,564
What?

630
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,015
What's this?

631
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:51,553
My word, she passed the audition?

632
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,088
The day is today.

633
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:59,644
This really is Ko Ye Ji.

634
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,723
My goodness.

635
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:02,207
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

636
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:05,307
You worked hard.

637
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:06,798
Good work.

638
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,335
- What's up?
- Sang Sik.

639
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:17,127
Are you with Ye Ji right now?

640
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:19,311
Ye Ji? No.

641
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:24,254
She isn't picking up, that's why I called.

642
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:28,230
Well, I'm going to send you a photo.

643
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,463
You should take a look at it.

644
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:30,463
A photo?

645
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:32,338
Yes, okay.

646
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:34,407
What's going on?

647
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:37,042
Sang Hee is going to send me a photo.

648
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,382
What's this about?

649
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:41,423
(Parental Consent Form)

650
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:42,529
What's wrong?

651
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:44,075
Take a look at this.

652
00:33:45,426 --> 00:33:46,723
(Parental Consent Form)

653
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:48,886
Is Ye Ji with SN Label?

654
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,478
I can't believe her.

655
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,421
Your call cannot be connected...

656
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,494
My goodness.

657
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,166
She's not picking up?

658
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,896
I should find her.
I'm not sure about this place.

659
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:05,162
How could she not tell me?

660
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:06,610
This isn't like Ye Ji.

661
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,626
I'll come with you.

662
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:09,187
No, you stay with your team.

663
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:12,290
They prefer their own company
to having their boss.

664
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,810
I can take the hint.

665
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,842
Seriously.

666
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:16,076
Just grab a cab.

667
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:21,024
Where did Chief Ko go?

668
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:22,250
I saw him leave.

669
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,106
- He left?
- Yes.

670
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,587
We can hang out on our own.

671
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,714
What's the point of that?

672
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,277
I've got other plans myself.

673
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:35,630
I'm really into Mi Rye.

674
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,388
To the point that I want to propose.

675
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:42,894
So please help me out.

676
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,189
I don't want to.

677
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:49,110
What? What did you say?

678
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:51,931
Did I just hear you wrong?

679
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:55,158
No. Forget Mi Rye.

680
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,166
What?

681
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,943
Who are you to tell me that?

682
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:01,666
Gi Cheol, you've had too many drinks.

683
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,991
No more drunken gibberish.

684
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:05,069
- I'm sorry.
- Let go.

685
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,579
What did you say to me?

686
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:09,424
What's going on?

687
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,456
Do you have feelings for Mi Rye?

688
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,457
Is that it?

689
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:15,419
If you like her, just say it!

690
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:16,898
Hello, Producer Nam.

691
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,506
Nam Gi Cheol, you lost it? Let go.

692
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:20,757
Jun Woo.

693
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:22,043
What's going on here?

694
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:23,630
Spit it out!

695
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,712
Yes!

696
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,060
I have feelings for Mi Rye, get it?

697
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:34,643
What? For real?

698
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,092
Why do you think Ye Ji did this?

699
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,665
I'll have to hear her out.

700
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,561
It could be because of me.

701
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:59,583
Why do you say that?

702
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:03,510
Maybe she left, afraid that
she'd get in our way.

703
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,087
That's hard to believe.

704
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:09,518
Why should I learn about
your love life online?

705
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:11,718
Then why haven't you asked me?

706
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,265
I have only one thing to tell you.

707
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,963
Don't feel bad about wanting to marry.

708
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:18,963
Feel bad?

709
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:21,432
And I'm good without a mom,

710
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:23,130
so leave me out of your relationship.

711
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,141
Why? Did something happen with Ye Ji?

712
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,026
That could be why.

713
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,026
What?

714
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:38,010
She might have left the house,

715
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,549
afraid she'd get in our way.

716
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,030
Good heavens.

717
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,942
Ko Ye Ji, she's in the 8th grade.

718
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,079
Wait a minute.

719
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,591
There is a trainee who came today.

720
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:55,368
- Here is the paper.
- Okay.

721
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,832
(Parental Consent Form: Ko Sang Sik)

722
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,337
How did this even happen?

723
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:01,344
Have you given your consent?

724
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,100
No, I've never seen it before.

725
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,833
How did this even happen?

726
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,866
Why don't you talk to your girl
in the practice room?

727
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,225
Which room is that?

728
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,694
I'll show you the way.

729
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:19,604
It's this way.

730
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:23,946
She's over there.

731
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:30,450
- I'll get her...
- Wait.

732
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,506
Don't storm in there all angry.

733
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:34,012
Let's first see how she does.

734
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:43,133
- Goodness.
- That was great.

735
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,419
Come out here.

736
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,402
Let me go.

737
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:54,681
You'd better explain yourself.

738
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:58,806
The kids selected in the audition...

739
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:01,264
are supposed to practice for a month,

740
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:03,662
then only one gets picked.

741
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:05,556
So I wanted to give it a shot.

742
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:07,596
But why didn't you tell me?

743
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:10,842
How could you make this decision
without asking me first?

744
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:12,328
Besides,

745
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:14,856
you forged my consent on the paper.

746
00:38:14,856 --> 00:38:16,540
I was going to tell you.

747
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,330
What?

748
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,251
You couldn't tell him because of me?

749
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:29,372
What are you talking about?

750
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,045
Well, it's sort of like that.

751
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:33,628
What?

752
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:37,194
I wanted to try out the audition,

753
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:40,243
but it's also because of you two...

754
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,638
that I wanted to leave.

755
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,254
What are you saying?

756
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:47,678
Ye ji.

757
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,159
Why make me speak of it first?

758
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,926
If you developed feelings for each other,

759
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:00,966
since I'm your daughter,

760
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:03,765
your one and only child,

761
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:07,934
shouldn't you have told me about it?

762
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,582
Isn't that what grown-ups do?

763
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:15,828
I didn't hear anything.

764
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,510
I only realized after seeing that photo.

765
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:24,371
The new article meant it was true.

766
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:25,876
Not knowing what to think,

767
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:28,095
I went to have a talk with her.

768
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:33,718
You both like each other,

769
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,575
so I didn't want to stand in your way.

770
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:45,619
I hoped that you'd come to me first,

771
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,334
but you didn't say anything.

772
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:51,198
That's why I told you not to feel bad.

773
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,216
And just because you're my dad,

774
00:39:57,196 --> 00:40:01,279
you shouldn't hold back or let her go.

775
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:14,511
But why didn't you tell me before?

776
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:19,661
Why make me confront it alone?

777
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:25,095
I'm sorry, Ye Ji. It's my fault.

778
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:29,982
No.

779
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:33,895
I'm to blame.

780
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,498
I should have informed you before.

781
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,561
But in my foolishness,

782
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,922
I ignored and hid my feelings.

783
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:51,705
That made it hard for you both.

784
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,802
I'm so sorry.

785
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:05,185
Ye Ji, I'll try to be more grown-up,

786
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:07,168
always putting you first...

787
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,374
and getting attuned to your feelings.

788
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:13,042
I'm sorry you had to bring it up first.

789
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,242
I realize how amazing you are,

790
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,091
but there is something to tell you.

791
00:41:19,816 --> 00:41:20,993
Sure, what is it?

792
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:25,344
I'm fine with you marrying my dad.

793
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:27,099
That's not an issue.

794
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,335
But I'd prefer it if you didn't...

795
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:34,001
try to act motherly towards me.

796
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:40,153
It's a new territory for you.

797
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,776
Since I lost my mom when I was born,

798
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:50,778
I don't know what it's like having one.

799
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:55,595
So, it's not necessary to play that role.

800
00:41:56,343 --> 00:42:00,679
Just be the woman my dad cares for,

801
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:04,161
and see me as your loved one's daughter.

802
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,451
Let's keep it comfortable that way.

803
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:12,856
All right.

804
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,926
Yes, I'll make sure to do that.

805
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,916
I'll do that, okay?

806
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:36,338
How about we have another round?

807
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:38,217
I need to head home.

808
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:41,361
Same here. I have work early tomorrow.

809
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:44,257
Then, we'll get a cab over there.

810
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,632
Okay, you do that.

811
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,584
- Good work today.
- Take care.

812
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:50,368
Where are you going? Let's drink.

813
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,312
Why did you down so much alcohol?

814
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:53,366
I'm not drunk at all.

815
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:55,599
Producer Nam must've been stressed lately.

816
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,471
I'm not drunk, so just one more glass.

817
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:00,239
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

818
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,711
I'll grab you a cab immediately.

819
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:02,765
Okay.

820
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,226
Producer Nam, are you okay?

821
00:43:07,226 --> 00:43:08,555
Ms. Ko.

822
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:11,962
Are you sure we can't be together?

823
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:14,393
What are you saying, Nam Gi Cheol?

824
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:16,516
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,778
Did I just get shot down?

826
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:26,031
- I got you a cab.
- Let's go.

827
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:27,971
- We'll take off first.
- Take care.

828
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,925
Nam Gi Cheol is rejected.

829
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:31,358
Keep it down.

830
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:34,566
They're all gone now.

831
00:43:35,252 --> 00:43:37,067
But where is Producer Gang?

832
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:38,943
She's with your brother, so don't worry.

833
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:40,534
Right.

834
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,436
Are you up for another drink?

835
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:47,463
What?

836
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:49,416
Sure.

837
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:54,074
All right.

838
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:56,586
See how it goes and talk after a week.

839
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:59,602
I won't be missing school, so don't worry.

840
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:00,777
Just don't work too hard.

841
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:02,786
Think of it like a camping trip.

842
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:05,841
But I want to give it my best shot.

843
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,450
Ye Ji has a point.

844
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,698
Everything has its time.

845
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:10,842
When would she ever have this fun?

846
00:44:12,512 --> 00:44:14,388
Call me if something comes up.

847
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,979
And make sure to eat well.

848
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:19,315
Dad, you take good care of her.

849
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:20,541
Okay, get back inside.

850
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,853
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

851
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:27,963
Goodness me.

852
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:29,642
You put in a lot of work.

853
00:44:29,642 --> 00:44:31,762
Raising a child isn't a walk in the park.

854
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,751
You had it harder.

855
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:37,034
I was thrown off seeing Ye Ji like that.

856
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:39,527
But she said what was right.

857
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:42,978
She noticed it when we were hesitating...

858
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:44,848
and even worried on her own.

859
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,472
They say as you grow older,

860
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:48,322
you learn a thing or two from your kids.

861
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:53,138
She doesn't need a mom, so what now?

862
00:44:54,216 --> 00:44:55,430
It's for the best.

863
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:57,228
What?

864
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,410
Now you can just focus on me.

865
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,646
Only me.

866
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,465
Hello, Yeong Ae.

867
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:12,330
Boss, where are you?

868
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,844
I'm still out. Why?

869
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,634
Gi Cheol is wasted after hitting
the bottle so hard.

870
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:20,381
He hurled everything and passed out.

871
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:23,316
But we're scheduled for a shoot
at the break of dawn,

872
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:26,618
so I think we need your backup.

873
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:28,499
Seeing Gi Cheol in this state,

874
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:31,963
I doubt we can even pull off the shoot.

875
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:34,028
All right, I'll come over now.

876
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:36,531
What's the matter?

877
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,763
I should head over to the hotel.

878
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:40,647
At this late hour?

879
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:43,126
Since I could be directing tomorrow,

880
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,994
I'll crash there for the night.

881
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:49,660
Then, I'll come with you.

882
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,272
What?

883
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:53,037
I'll take you there.

884
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:06,106
Soju is the best liquor, right?

885
00:46:06,585 --> 00:46:11,771
Perfect with stir-fried rice cakes,
pork cartilage, cucumber, and carrots.

886
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:14,043
Do you feel awkward right now?

887
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:16,426
No.

888
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:18,668
We've drank together loads of times.

889
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:24,200
So, are you ready to talk it out?

890
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,916
When and why did you start
seeing me differently?

891
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:36,863
Well, I'm not sure.

892
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:42,009
But maybe it was when you
split with our neighbor.

893
00:46:42,374 --> 00:46:45,252
Why? Did you feel sorry for me?

894
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:48,415
Yes, my heart ached for you.

895
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:56,965
The others didn't seem to get
your feelings for her,

896
00:46:56,965 --> 00:46:58,546
but I could see why.

897
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:00,629
Your mother.

898
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:06,778
I remember your mother.

899
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:09,117
Even when the light went out,

900
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,066
she waited for your father all day.

901
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:15,397
As kids, we bought a new light bulb,

902
00:47:15,397 --> 00:47:18,422
and you climbed up on a chair
to reach it but couldn't,

903
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,262
so I lifted you.

904
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:25,117
But when Producer Gang moved in,

905
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:28,885
she took care of the repairs
and even the flooring.

906
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,703
That's what drew you in, right?

907
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:35,263
Yes, you're right.

908
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,378
But Jun Woo,

909
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:44,948
I hope you move past those old scars...

910
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,856
and find true love now.

911
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,711
And it'd be great if that is me.

912
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:51,711
What?

913
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:57,072
What I had with you and Sang Sik...

914
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:59,482
is more vivid than what I had
with my parents.

915
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:01,541
Maybe it's because they died early.

916
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:05,477
I fell asleep in Sang Sik's arms...

917
00:48:05,477 --> 00:48:09,211
and skipped kindergarten
to jump in puddles with you.

918
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:12,572
That's what happiness means to me.

919
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:14,501
Memories are that important.

920
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:19,686
Now that you're all grown-up,

921
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:23,679
you want to make memories
in someplace new?

922
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:26,008
Exactly.

923
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:27,867
You're also grown-up now.

924
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:31,091
So, in a decade or two,

925
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,365
I hope you look back now and smile.

926
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:39,293
Thanks, kid.

927
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:42,165
Stop calling me kid, you kid!

928
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,213
What? But you're so tiny.

929
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:54,281
And keep in touch with your mother.

930
00:48:55,259 --> 00:48:57,973
Thanks to her amazing son,
she's happy now.

931
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:03,412
All right.

932
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:12,077
Thanks for the food.

933
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:14,642
What do you need to say?

934
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:16,526
My instant noodles will get soggy.

935
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,374
I said what I needed to say that day.

936
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:23,925
It's hot.

937
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,421
Why are you here this late?

938
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:30,451
Why? I've missed you.

939
00:49:33,322 --> 00:49:34,589
Did you drink?

940
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:36,202
Yes.

941
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:40,336
I turn away guys who show up
after having drinks.

942
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:42,095
You said I'm your student.

943
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,758
Right.

944
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,255
But you say you're a man!

945
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:47,386
Right.

946
00:49:47,386 --> 00:49:49,180
Just eat and go.

947
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,970
Relax, I won't be staying the night.

948
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,165
Can you even hear yourself?

949
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:54,963
Mind what you say to your teacher.

950
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:56,702
You wouldn't care as my teacher.

951
00:49:57,963 --> 00:49:59,969
- What a player.
- What?

952
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,586
Playing your cards right
to play hard to get.

953
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:06,034
You're always leaving me to guess.

954
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:29,219
Yes, all right.

955
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:34,001
Why is he going to that hotel?

956
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,807
Who?

957
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:38,034
Who else? It's Ko Sang Sik.

958
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:42,034
He just went in with Gang Min Ju.

959
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,623
What?

960
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,081
Here.

961
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,980
What do you have on him?

962
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:00,020
Well, I looked into the recent
study program issue.

963
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,079
Turns out his sister was behind it.

964
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,083
What?

965
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,075
In the list of applicants,

966
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:08,528
Chief Ko's sister's name showed up.

967
00:51:08,528 --> 00:51:11,398
She even took a public loan in his name.

968
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:15,509
But Chief Ko doesn't have a clue.

969
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,869
This could blow up on him, right?

970
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:21,437
I see.

971
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,461
It seems everyone is asleep.

972
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:01,125
What is that noise?

973
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,020
- It's the air conditioning.
- The air conditioning?

974
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,925
Since it gets humid next to the river,

975
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:07,788
Gi Cheol must have turned it on.

976
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:09,985
It does feel damp here.

977
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:11,259
You should go now.

978
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,657
Where would I go alone?

979
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:15,723
What?

980
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,135
Let's see...

981
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:20,502
It must be that room.

982
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:25,292
Goodness.

983
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,777
Look, lay off the drinks.

984
00:52:34,023 --> 00:52:36,418
Aren't you going to explain it to me?

985
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:40,857
What? Tell you what?

986
00:52:42,286 --> 00:52:44,457
About what happened at the karaoke.

987
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:47,963
Do you mean before?

988
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,905
What you told Producer Nam.

989
00:52:52,888 --> 00:52:54,954
Right, that.

990
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,404
"Right, that?"

991
00:52:57,404 --> 00:53:01,286
So it didn't mean anything?

992
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:04,447
The meaning of it?

993
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:08,502
Well, I have you locked down.

994
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,326
Goodness.

995
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:14,889
What? Should I tell you more?

996
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:18,999
- Give me that.
- Wait.

997
00:53:26,972 --> 00:53:30,218
You can't even be honest with me.

998
00:53:33,846 --> 00:53:37,425
I don't want anyone else to have you.

999
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:42,304
Hello.

1000
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,553
It's late. You hurry back.

1001
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,818
I'm sorry, Ms. Koo.

1002
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:01,818
What for?

1003
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:07,158
I dropped by unannounced and drunk.

1004
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,494
I've felt bad about how we left things.

1005
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,693
Did you come to tell me that?

1006
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,262
No.

1007
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,264
Then?

1008
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:30,109
You see, I broke up with the dentist.

1009
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,435
She sensed how I felt...

1010
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,574
and suggested that we end it.

1011
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:40,328
So, I said we should. And...

1012
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:41,662
And?

1013
00:54:41,662 --> 00:54:43,612
Then it hit me.

1014
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:47,125
That I may be destined to be alone.

1015
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,658
That came to mind.

1016
00:54:48,658 --> 00:54:50,863
I'm sure it's just a phase.

1017
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:52,596
No.

1018
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:55,949
I'll stay forever single like you.

1019
00:54:57,899 --> 00:55:00,714
Thinking that made me miss you.

1020
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,639
That's why I decided to show up.

1021
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:09,660
Then, until you find a nice girl,

1022
00:55:10,297 --> 00:55:12,545
we could work out together...

1023
00:55:12,545 --> 00:55:15,804
and catch the movies. Do you want to?

1024
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,610
Yes.

1025
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:23,901
Okay, off you go.

1026
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:26,020
I'll be off. You get inside.

1027
00:56:10,181 --> 00:56:13,485
We're done drinking tea, so head back.

1028
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:16,272
I'm not finished yet.

1029
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,107
I should wash up and sleep
because I'm beat.

1030
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:21,379
Okay, work hard tomorrow.

1031
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,922
- All right.
- I'll come by if I can.

1032
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,830
The shoot is at the crack of dawn.

1033
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:56,588
Ko Sang Sik.

1034
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:58,111
- Yes?
- What's that?

1035
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:10,865
Hurry, we have to evacuate.

1036
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,414
Leave it to me and use the fire escape.

1037
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:15,421
What are you saying? Come with me.

1038
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:16,510
Go now. This will be bad.

1039
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,350
No, I won't go alone but together.

1040
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:19,509
I'll wake everyone up first.

1041
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:22,671
Don't take the elevator.

1042
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:25,152
And stay low on the stairs, okay?

1043
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:27,659
- Okay.
- Be careful.

1044
00:57:33,392 --> 00:57:34,632
Yeong Ae.

1045
00:57:34,632 --> 00:57:36,471
Wake up, there is a fire.

1046
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:37,551
What's going on?

1047
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:39,287
Cover your mouth with a wet towel.

1048
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:40,808
And take the fire escape, okay?

1049
00:57:40,808 --> 00:57:42,113
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

1050
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,255
Are you okay?

1051
00:57:47,419 --> 00:57:49,041
Wake up. There is a fire.

1052
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,702
- Hurry, get out.
- Fire?

1053
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:55,082
- Fire!
- Fire!

1054
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:00,282
Hurry down the fire escape.

1055
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,062
Boss.

1056
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:08,008
- Hurry.
- Boss.

1057
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:15,886
Wait a minute.

1058
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:20,626
This way. Take the fire escape.

1059
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:24,594
I can down some more.

1060
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:27,965
- I can't sleep yet.
- Goodness.

1061
00:58:28,747 --> 00:58:29,747
Okay?

1062
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:32,279
I need another round.

1063
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:36,631
You haven't said how you feel.

1064
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,773
- Goodness.
- This doesn't count.

1065
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:47,032
You haven't confessed to me.

1066
00:58:49,078 --> 00:58:50,487
You haven't yet.

1067
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:25,366
Wait, you can't take the elevator!

1068
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,453
Get down the fire escape!

1069
00:59:27,453 --> 00:59:29,224
Keep your head down!

1070
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:33,879
Fire!

1071
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:41,637
Su Hyeon, wake up!

1072
00:59:41,637 --> 00:59:43,456
Su Hyeon, there is a fire!

1073
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:51,657
Hurry. Be careful.

1074
00:59:53,274 --> 00:59:54,274
Watch your step.

1075
00:59:58,185 --> 00:59:59,921
- Wook Sa Ma.
- Are you okay?

1076
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:01,494
Take the fire escape.

1077
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:02,719
Where is Na Ju Yeon's room?

1078
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,630
It's straight and to the left.

1079
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:19,256
Na Ju Yeon, there is a fire!

1080
01:00:22,939 --> 01:00:26,253
Take the fire escape. No elevator.

1081
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:27,504
It's straight and to the left.

1082
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,044
- What's the status?
- The truck can't get through.

1083
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:56,896
- Any casualties?
- We're still checking.

1084
01:00:56,896 --> 01:00:58,273
Hasn't the ladder truck arrived?

1085
01:00:58,273 --> 01:00:59,273
Not yet.

1086
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,660
Darn it. Get in there now!

1087
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,660
Yes, sir.

1088
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:05,581
Slowly. Watch your step.

1089
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:06,680
Watch your step.

1090
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,648
Producer Gang is upstairs.

1091
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:10,376
- What?
- She's upstairs.

1092
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,594
Okay, get down. Keep order.

1093
01:01:20,669 --> 01:01:21,673
Gi Cheol!

1094
01:01:21,673 --> 01:01:23,634
- This is crazy.
- Gi Cheol, are you okay?

1095
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:27,766
Gi Cheol, where is Boss?

1096
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:29,938
She and Chief Ko were saving people.

1097
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:34,707
I hope they're not still in there.

1098
01:01:34,707 --> 01:01:35,741
Boss!

1099
01:02:16,044 --> 01:02:17,070
Min Ju!

1100
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:18,910
Min Ju!

1101
01:02:26,164 --> 01:02:27,164
Min Ju!

1102
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:28,847
Min Ju!

1103
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,163
Min Ju!

1104
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,891
Min Ju. Gang Min Ju.

1105
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,755
Wake up. Min Ju, we have to go.

1106
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:44,832
Min Ju!

1107
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,720
I can't move. What now?

1108
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,970
No, we have to get out.

1109
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:42,650
(Second to Last Love)

1110
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:46,255
But he's finally fallen for someone.

1111
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,032
Put the Woori City Drama on hold?

1112
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,121
I won't run away this time.

1113
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:52,506
Why would the crew start a fire?

1114
01:03:52,506 --> 01:03:53,616
You'd better be prepared.

1115
01:03:53,616 --> 01:03:55,448
What are you talking about?

1116
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:56,976
I've got an invitation from Canada.

1117
01:03:56,976 --> 01:03:58,224
For five years?

1118
01:03:58,224 --> 01:03:59,278
Do you want to come with me?

1119
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:02,093
Please open your eyes.

1120
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:04,578
I'll do anything if you wake up.

1121
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:06,803
