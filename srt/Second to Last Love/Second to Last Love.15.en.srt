1
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:34,189
Those who are destined will meet.

2
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,244
Even if you try to run.

3
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,283
Even if you circle Earth ten times.

4
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:47,077
Those who are destined will meet.

5
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:51,724
Even if you try to run.

6
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:53,552
Even if you circle Earth ten times.

7
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:09,116
What brings you here?

8
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:11,571
I came to see the filming location.

9
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,336
What are you doing in such a high place?

10
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:18,161
After coming here for work,

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,163
I wanted to do some inspection.

12
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,140
It's risky and unnerving,

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,424
but this great view...

14
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,425
compels me to cross it, anyway.

15
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,690
Yes, it's a bit scary.

16
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:35,279
But rather than giving up in dread,

17
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,366
we should keep going slowly.

18
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,218
Wouldn't that chase away the fear?

19
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,146
If you turn back and run,

20
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,549
it will remain scary and intimidating.

21
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:54,197
With you here, it feels less scary.

22
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:00,188
Then, we can cross it together.

23
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,938
How could you leave without a word?

24
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,543
What more is there to say?

25
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:23,282
I know how you feel.

26
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:25,585
But that's...

27
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:26,890
Weren't you being honest?

28
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,332
Honest?

29
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,027
I can't look at you
as if nothing happened.

30
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:38,918
That was my honest feeling,

31
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,084
but it's not what I truly mean.

32
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:42,398
That may sound confusing.

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,719
No, I get what you mean.

34
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,535
It's somewhat comforting.

35
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,110
How have you been doing?

36
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:56,110
I've been working.

37
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,156
How did you convince Mr. Wook?

38
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:02,189
I showed him some local interviews.

39
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,207
You know how he helped
with the grape festival?

40
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,996
The gratitude of the local folks...

41
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,479
must have touched his heart.

42
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:14,197
By the way,

43
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:16,624
I heard you visited Ye Ji's school
to talk about your career.

44
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,130
Did she tell you that?

45
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,939
I called to thank you,
but you didn't pick up.

46
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,165
Why didn't you come that day?

47
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:27,988
You see, I saw the message later.

48
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:31,190
You were sharing an umbrella
with a woman that day.

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,219
You saw that?

50
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,445
I know that could be misleading...

51
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:40,046
I know you'd obey the traffic rules
even if you're lost in a desert.

52
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,752
You're always too proper.

53
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,904
How have you been doing?

54
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:50,957
I went to the arboretum each morning.

55
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,180
It was the same old path,

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,438
but there were new things to behold.

57
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,784
Things like flowers and trees.

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,945
And yet, they have always been there.

59
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,704
Maybe I was seeing with my eyes,
but my heart was blind.

60
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:13,257
It felt like discovering hidden images.

61
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:18,342
As if I couldn't find and recognize you.

62
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,271
I've missed you.

63
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,197
I wanted to say it more than anything.

64
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:35,699
I've missed you.

65
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,052
(Second to Last Love)

66
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,308
(Episode 15)

67
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,006
What's got you so preoccupied?

68
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:02,522
I'm helping with your work.

69
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:03,636
For the Woori City drama?

70
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,797
Yes, I'm picking out food items
for scenes.

71
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,678
Then, we're a team now.

72
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,978
I also have to get some ready
for the press conference.

73
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,291
Did you meet Producer Gang?

74
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,275
Yes, she asked me for help.

75
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,131
Where is she staying?

76
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:21,650
You should have asked her.

77
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,568
I did, but she wouldn't tell me.

78
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,962
Your brother will find her.

79
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:29,747
I hope they use social media...

80
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,614
to keep in touch and send messages.

81
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:38,163
If they end up living together,

82
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,657
what should I do then?

83
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:40,657
Do what?

84
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:42,577
I might make them feel awkward.

85
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,962
Then,

86
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,500
let's get them to move out.

87
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,510
Goodness.

88
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,991
Good idea?

89
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,521
Good heavens.

90
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,531
Do you still see me as a little kid?

91
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,531
What?

92
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,999
No, it's not that...

93
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,415
What's with her these days?

94
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:10,140
We should host the press conference
on the ferry?

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,091
Yes. Why not?

96
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:15,332
Isn't that place unnerving?
The ceiling fell.

97
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,291
They fixed it all up.

98
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,420
- Who told you that?
- Chief Ko.

99
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:22,449
- You met him?
- Yes.

100
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,826
What did he say?
Did you get asked to move back?

101
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,548
No, he didn't mention it.

102
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,709
What?

103
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,174
Anyway, it's going to be on the ferry.

104
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,270
So let everyone know.

105
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,734
Okay.

106
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,250
Welcome, Reporter Koo.

107
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,673
It's been a while since we last spoke.

108
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,086
Yes, have a seat.

109
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,890
Hearing you have something good,

110
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,579
I cleared my schedule to come here.

111
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,889
Good call.

112
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:56,820
This may not make the headlines,

113
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,280
but it can garner some attention.

114
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,184
(Woori Nature Ferry)

115
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,622
The ferry?

116
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,486
There was talk when it was shut down.

117
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:12,349
But the news has already been covered.

118
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,618
There is another page.

119

(Woori City Drama, "Love and Cooking")

120
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:19,214
The Woori City Drama?

121
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:20,898
Don't you feel that something is up?

122
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,144
Having the press conference
on the ferry means...

123
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,592
I suspect a shady deal between
the network and the city.

124
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,652
They're trying to cover up
the ferry issue.

125
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:35,846
Come to think of it,

126
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:39,264
they even changed the winner
in the drama selection.

127
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,128
That's what I'm talking about.

to showcase Woori City's natural allure.

130
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,405
Tasked with sharing its wonders,

131
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,496
you are fully committed...

132
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:56,319
to elevate our city's status globally...

134
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,143
Well done.

135
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,825
You've come through with another task.

136
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,623
It's exciting to have Mr. Wook...

137
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,238
champion our city and feature as the lead.

138
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:18,190
Will he press event be held on the ferry?

139
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,703
Yes, it could set a beneficial precedent,

140
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,694
and with its promotional aspect,

141
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:27,318
it could help transform the ferry
into a maritime museum.

142
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:30,887
Let's gear up for a grand launch.

143

Yes, ma'am.

144
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,745
A press conference held on the ferry?

145
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:44,233
Is there a problem?

146
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,170
No. Why would it be an issue?

147
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,783
If the drama and ferry turn out well,

148
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,365
it would make my day.

149
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,365
However,

150
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,595
that's when everything runs smoothly.

151
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,531
Keep working hard.

152
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,904
Thanks for the congratulations.

153
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:12,136
Sure.

154
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,456
Let's see.

155
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,137
My goodness, you look amazing.

156
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,921
Isn't this what you wanted for me?

157
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,154
Yes.

158
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,720
You should always stand strong
and be independent...

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,753
to lead a good life.

160
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:26,391
Especially since we're on our own.

161
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:29,135
But you have people who are like family.

162
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,387
And there is Mi Rye.

163
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:32,737
I envy that.

164
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:38,033
I'm going to work hard for my new goal.

165
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,799
Doesn't that mean we can be together?

166
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:51,813
I always want to look out for you...

167
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,797
like I would for my own sister,
that's all.

168
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:57,342
I'm like a sister, and you're just friends
with Mi Rye?

169
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,835
Exactly.

170
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:07,687
I can't wait to see the pretty woman
you'll end up with.

171
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,349
You get going.

172
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,701
I have something to discuss
with the drama crew.

173
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:13,727
Okay.

174
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:17,829
Come on, Min Ji Seon.

175
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,158
It was just a sisterly peck.

176
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,158
I'm off.

177
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,801
Goodness.

178
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:31,635
What are you doing here?

179
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,776
What?

180
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,878
This was crooked.

181
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:38,801
My word.

182
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,220
- Let's go.
- Okay.

183
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:49,702
The team has compiled these documents.

184
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,899
Yes, I'll take a look and let you know.

185
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:58,857
And Chef Park Jun Woo here...

186
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,682
will be our drama's culinary consultant...

187
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:03,506
and pick out local dishes and eateries.

188
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,955
I ask for your help.

189
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,916
We're counting on your assistance.

190
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,980
Does this mean we can taste
Chef Park's dishes?

191
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,396
We have to taste them first.

192
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,340
You had his packed lunch.

193
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,348
The packed lunch? Right.

194
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:20,087
That was seriously delicious.

195
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,675
You can visit my cafe.

196
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:24,036
That's exciting.

197
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:25,623
Doesn't Chief Ko live there?

198
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,474
Let's prepare well for the press briefing.

199
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:30,634
All right.

200
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,187
- Shall we get going?
- Sure.

201
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,757
- Thanks for everything.
- Thank you.

202
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,932
I'll get going.

203
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,049
All right, Jun Woo.

204
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,427
Go on and make it up to her.

205
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:52,021
Okay.

206
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:53,736
I'm off.

207
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,797
I saw him come in here.

208
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,690
It was definitely Park Cheon Su.

209
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,910
You're dead meat when I catch you.

210
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,045
What on Earth?

211
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,651
I can't get out right now.

212
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:18,110
There is a pervert inside.

213
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,393
What? A pervert?

214
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,354
Richard Park?

215
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,433
I got you now.

216
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:49,854
Here is our Deputy Mayor.

217
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,677
Hello.

218
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,090
Congratulations, Gang Min Ju.

219
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,717
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

220
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,247
You look elegant and beautiful today.

221
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:05,903
No wonder I'm into you.

222
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:09,204
I should be hosting it well today.

223
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:10,724
Don't stress about it and enjoy it.

224
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,522
You deserve it. Good work.

225
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:13,693
- You take a seat.
- Okay.

226
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,587
Thank you to all the reporters
who have come today...

227
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:28,365
and our actors and dedicated crew.

228
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,151
At this great ferry event...

229
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,186
Mommy.

230
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,579
Is she your daughter?

231
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,927
I hope you grace us with your presence...

232
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,392
and have a delightful time.

233
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:43,392
Thank you.

234
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,564
- Is the food delicious?
- Yes.

235
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:55,247
Please enjoy and promote our drama.

236
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,236
You should have something to eat.

237
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:03,723
I'm okay. You should eat.

238
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:05,238
There is some work left for me.

239
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:06,843
Look.

240
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,484
Was that comment work-related?

241
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:15,088
Or was it more personal?

242
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,179
What?

243
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,629
You said I should grab some food.

244
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,846
I wonder if you're just being polite...

245
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:27,280
or if you're really worried about me.

246
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,193
It's both.

247
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,575
And I mean what I said.

248
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,633
That's not comforting at all.

249
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,034
What was that?

250
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,534
That gave me a scare.

251
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,510
What's with the weather?

252
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,295
There wasn't any mention of rain today.

253
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:54,174
It's the last thing we need.

254
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:02,197
What's your take on this weather?

255
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,647
There wasn't any rain forecast.

256
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,680
You don't have to worry.

257
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,334
Let's get some tarps ready, just in case.

258
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,334
All right.

259
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:14,439
Having the press conference here...

260
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,928
is good publicity for the drama
and the ferry project.

261
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,742
It can't just sit idle...

262
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:23,623
after getting all these repairs.

263
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,103
There are bound to be hiccups.

264
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:28,895
I'll make him take the fall for me.

265
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:33,501
If Gang Min Ju's drama takes off,

266
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,275
it'll cause a blow
to my professional standing...

267
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,144
and make me look bad.

268
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:39,232
The production won't be a breeze.

269
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,980
I'll make sure to keep it that way.

270
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,282
Reporter Koo. Over here!

271
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:48,144
- Let's have you two meet.
- I'm Reporter Koo.

272
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:50,565
- I've heard such good things about you.
- I see.

273
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:05,798
You got dessert.

274
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,560
- Did you have enough?
- Yes, I'm full.

275
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,805
Mi Rye, I got you some treats.

276
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,551
Why did you bring so much?

277
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,959
You can enjoy some yourself.

278
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,426
I get full watching you eat.

279
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,706
Gi Cheol, you're going for it today.

280
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:22,874
Hello.

281
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,828
The food is so delicious.

282
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,659
Good grief, can't you help yourself?

283
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,020
Get your own plate.

284
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,131
I'm also a writer on the team.

285
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,556
Ms. Na, please have some.

286
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,343
But I got it for you.

287
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,092
Eat all you want.

288
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:40,166
That's okay, I'll get it myself.

289
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,571
Mom, I got you some food.

290
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,405
Look at you! That's so sweet of you.

291
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:48,133
Now, let's sit here and enjoy.

292
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:40,887
Is it raining?

293
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,102
This isn't looking good.

294
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:47,651
We should cancel the rest of the evening.

295
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,797
But the actors haven't been interviewed.

296
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,796
Look here, it's just a passing drizzle.

297
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,851
Can't you see that?

298
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,262
There wasn't any rain forecast.

299
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,430
Even so, just in case...

300
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,038
How would you hold major events
with such weak nerves?

301
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,454
It would be disastrous with a downpour.

302
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:07,878
But we made all these preparations.

303
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,545
Don't worry, it's going to clear up.

304
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:12,483
Just continue as planned.

305
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,246
Is there something wrong?

306
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,926
Yes, we have to call off the event.

307
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,648
- What?
- Hold on.

308
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,142
Yes, this is Chief Ko.

309
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,521
There might be a hailstorm soon.

310
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:46,642
Please check with the weather center
and the Ministry of Security...

311
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:49,024
to send out emergency alert text messages.

312
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:50,857
The greenhouses and farm windows...

313
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,456
need to be covered with either
cardboard or styrofoam.

314
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:54,818
And urge people to stay indoors...

315
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,542
and to prepare cautiously at the farms.

316
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,129
Yes, okay.

317
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,885
Hail? Are you sure?

318
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:02,885
Yes.

319
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:06,995
My word.

320
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,378
You should take cover.

321
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,035
What's this?

322
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,066
Is it going to pour?

323
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:22,380
Ji Seon, you look gorgeous.
Congratulations.

324
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,078
Congratulations to you, too.

325
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:27,264
What's this all over your face?

326
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:31,888
Are you and Mi Rye just friends?

327
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,106
Yes.

328
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,562
Why would you ask that?

329
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:37,150
You seem to have a special bond.

330
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:39,454
Well, they are special.

331
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,291
Just like a sister and brother.

332
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,524
Do you mean like siblings?

333
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,387
Please take good care of her.

334
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:46,581
Why are you saying that?

335
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,692
Of course. Don't worry about it.

336
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,579
Mi Rye is incredibly talented.

337
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,979
It's baffling that she hasn't had
her big break yet.

338
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,141
That makes it so frustrating.

339
00:20:57,535 --> 00:21:01,002
I'm nervous about the writer interview.

340
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:02,480
You'll do great.

341
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,786
I'm looking forward to it.

342
00:21:03,786 --> 00:21:05,589
- Don't expect too much.
- I can't wait.

343
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,534
My word, it's cold.

344
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,299
What?

345
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:12,843
What if it starts to rain harder?

346
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:14,893
Like at the grape festival.

347
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,071
I'm sure it'll just pass.

348
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,720
We'll have to call off the event.

349
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,851
How about we finish up what's left?

350
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,479
Let's get everyone inside.

351
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,926
- Right now?
- Yes.

352
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,098
It looks like there is a hailstorm coming.

353
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,794
Hail?

354
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:40,380
But I didn't hear any forecast.

355
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,738
Temperature shifts make it unpredictable,

356
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:44,674
so it's hard to forecast hail.

357
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:46,267
Don't you remember the autumn festival?

358
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,545
That's true.

359
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:48,987
We should get everyone inside.

360
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:51,619
And for anything fragile on the tables,

361
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,341
they should be covered with tarps.

362
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,341
Okay.

363
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:56,318
Deputy Mayor.

364
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,802
It seems there is a hailstorm coming.

365
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,129
- Hail?
- Yes.

366
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,066
I doubt we'll see any hail.

367
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:10,426
Perhaps we should call it off.

368
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,247
Wait.

369
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,631
Why cancel it?

370
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,006
It could really start pouring.

371
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,299
Come on.

372
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,629
You said there needs to be an issue.

373
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,853
Yes, that's right.

374
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,300
The event is nearly over, anyway.

375
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,881
Just see it through.

376
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,831
Deputy Mayor,
don't you remember the fall festival?

377
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:37,886
Because of hail...

378
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,910
That sounds like an idea.

379
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,800
Move the tables to the center
away from the windows.

380
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,598
Chief Ko, can I have a word?

381
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:00,691
Let's continue the rest of the event.

382
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:03,406
No, there is hail coming.

383
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:05,118
It could become disastrous.

384
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,696
There could even be casualties.

385
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,155
We have so many reporters here.

386
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,148
What would happen to our city's image
if we call off the event?

387
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:13,584
Are you going to take responsibility?

388
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:15,748
We're almost done as it is.

389
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:17,651
So, let's just wrap up the rest.

390
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:19,937
But sir...

391
00:23:24,964 --> 00:23:26,812
We decided to continue the event.

392
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,439
But what if it starts to get worse?

393
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,013
My goodness.

394
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,942
Why does it have to rain now?

395
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,303
It's messing up my style.

396
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,524
We better hurry and finish up.

397
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:45,876
I came prepared to show off
for my daughter.

398
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,972
It's time for some spotlight.

399
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,995
This time, let's have the writers...

400
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,250
Wait a minute.

401
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,796
There could be rain and hail soon.

402
00:23:56,796 --> 00:23:58,429
We must get you indoors...

403
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:00,371
Please remain calm.

404
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:02,835
It's not even raining hard.

405
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:05,539
So let's get through the rest.

406
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,881
I appreciate your cooperation.

407
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:10,240
We must call it off.

408
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,102
It's nearly finished, anyway.

409
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,287
Let's call it off and get everyone inside.

410
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,298
Come on, writers to the stage.

411
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,861
- But...
- Let's get you up here.

412
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,485
Take cover out of the hail.

413
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:33,603
Hail?

414
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,055
Hurry, get inside.

415
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,590
What are you going to do?

416
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,191
I'll help these people evacuate.

417
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:43,552
You can make sure it's orderly
and safe inside.

418
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:44,785
- All right.
- Okay.

419
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:48,081
- Please listen up.
- Sang Sik.

420
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:51,200
There are four entrances to the ferry.

421
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,483
The ladies can enter the front...

422
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:57,234
while the men can enter the back.

423
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,152
If you keep a single line,

424
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:03,418
there won't be any tripping on the stairs.

425
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,654
Please move quickly.

426
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,443
Hurry, get inside.

427
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,872
- This way.
- Wait for me.

428
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:27,310
Take your time.

429
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,276
Slowly, so you don't get hurt.

430
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,732
Please don't hurry.

431
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:32,849
- Take your time.
- Don't hurry.

432
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,276
Walk down slowly.

433
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,884
Jun Woo!

434
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,383
Jun Woo! Where are you?

435
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,726
You get inside.

436
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,501
One at a time, or you'll get hurt.

437
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,549
Take your time.

438
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,972
Hurry, get inside.

439
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:49,458
Walk down slowly.

440
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,170
Watch your step coming down.

441
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,557
- Deputy Mayor.
- I can't believe this.

442
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:54,734
Are you hurt anywhere?

443
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,640
No, please watch your step.

444
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,718
Sol!

445
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,101
Sol, where are you?

446
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:06,014
What's wrong?

447
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,897
I can't find my girl anywhere.

448
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,395
I'll look for her. You get inside.

449
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,498
No, I have to find her.

450
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:16,381
- Sol!
- You might get hurt.

451
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:18,901
Hurry down. She could be inside.

452
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:20,807
Sol!

453
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,958
Sol!

454
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:30,706
Han Sol!

455
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,908
This won't do! Take cover!

456
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,808
Hurry! Get inside!

457
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:06,972
Please sit this way.

458
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,750
Keep to the center, away from the window.

459
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,739
Sol!

460
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,520
Haven't you seen Sol?

461
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,589
Sol?

462
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:18,912
Producer Gang is outside looking for her.

463
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,546
- Sol.
- It's dangerous out. Sit down.

464
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,741
Are you okay?

465
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:37,231
Yes. Are you hurt anywhere?

466
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,005
I'm all right.

467
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,583
Okay, that's good.

468
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,951
Why aren't you inside like I told you?

469
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:46,539
How could I when you're out here?

470
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:48,664
Good grief.

471
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,869
That's too bad about your interview.

472
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,293
That's not important.

473
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,720
Look at what happened.

474
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,218
It's such a mess.

475
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:07,295
Sol!

476
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,783
Han Sol!

477
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,147
Sol! Han...

478
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,985
Sol? Han Sol?

479
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:23,743
Are you Sol?

480
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,707
- Mommy!
- My goodness.

481
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,881
Are you hurt anywhere?

482
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,777
No. Where is Mommy?

483
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,600
Okay, let's get you to Mommy.

484
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,297
Hold my hand, since it's not safe.

485
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,556
Let's go.

486
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,258
Ms. Na, don't worry.

487
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:42,501
- Mommy.
- Sol is here.

488
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,855
Sol!

489
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,340
What about Chief Ko?

490
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,182
Chief Ko? What? Where is he?

491
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:57,467
He went out looking for you and Sol.

492
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:58,507
What?

493
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,760
Gang Min Ju!

494
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:18,657
Ko Sang Sik!

495
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,976
Sang Sik, I'm over here!

496
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,557
Let's go.

497
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:05,069
Did you just save me?

498
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,194
Let me take a look.

499
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:08,596
Where is the child?

500
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:10,381
I got her inside.

501
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:11,381
Are you okay?

502
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,635
I'm okay.

503
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,877
Why did you come outside?

504
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,454
You weren't anywhere.

505
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:31,934
Is that work-related or personal?

506
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:35,512
Has anyone been hurt?

507
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:38,045
No, everyone is okay except for you.

508
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,163
You should get this examined
at the hospital.

509
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,459
What I do is all personal, starting now.

510
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:25,562
Don't go anywhere.

511
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:28,185
Stay by my side.

512
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,314
Then, don't push me away again.

513
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:36,952
If you do,

514
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:41,435
I won't ever look for you.

515
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,754
And I won't ever forgive you.

516
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,918
Will you let me...

517
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,734
keep you in my heart?

518
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:35,501
Wait, the hail stopped.

519
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:45,114
What's this?

520
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:47,139
(Emergency Alert Message)

521
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:54,125
It comes after everything.

522
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:58,129
The sudden hailstorm last night
was quite a scare.

523
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:01,145
On the riverside ferry at Forest Village,

524
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,505
the SBC network, and Woori City...

525
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,697
were holding an event for their drama.

526
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:07,483
After evacuating dozens from the deck...

527
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,709
where the banquet was taking place,

528
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:12,389
Chief Ko Sang Sik is the talk of the town.

529
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:20,584
Goodness.

530
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,847
Too much damage was made
before the harvest.

531
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:28,074
Since it's caused by a natural disaster,

532
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,713
we will do our best to provide support.

533
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:33,698
Yes, thank you so much.

534
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,580
- Don't you worry.
- Thank you.

535
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:37,962
Yes?

536
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:42,334
There you are. Take a seat.

537
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,367
Well done.

538
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,172
I hope you're not hurt.

539
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:50,003
It's all thanks to you.
But I caught a cold.

540
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,736
We had to stop the press event...

541
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:55,305
due to the unexpected change in weather.

542
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,595
But thanks to your fast thinking,

543
00:33:57,595 --> 00:34:00,435
our city is recognized
for handling it well.

544
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:02,992
That's good to hear.

545
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:05,153
But there is a problem.

546
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:08,758
The ferry is in awful shape.

547
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,285
There are shattered windows everywhere.

548
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:14,071
That couldn't be helped due to the hail.

549
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:15,759
So it's going to need more repair.

550
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:19,325
But many are for selling the ferry
to another private party.

551
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,447
But, you see...

552
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,341
It has already been great trouble,

553
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:24,934
and we have wasted enough finances.

554
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,453
We have already invested in the project.

555
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:30,461
And with some repairs,

556
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:31,908
it could turn into a children's museum

557
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,117
thanks to getting the media attention.

558
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:36,319
But who can guarantee any profit?

559
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,460
It's not about making money.

560
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,702
The ferry wasn't operating
in the first place.

561
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:43,342
So we can create a cultural spot...

562
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,918
or make it educational for the kids.

563
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,006
I get your point,

564
00:34:48,006 --> 00:34:50,574
but it would cost a lot to repair.

565
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:54,491
What if we run out of the budget
for the city drama?

566
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:57,831
Well, we can't let that happen.

567
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:02,090
How about selling it off for a bargain?

568
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:04,802
Chief Ko?

569
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,833
I'll look into it.

570
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:17,695
Ko Mi Rye, are you that unwell?

571
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:21,687
No, this is from my nerves yesterday.

572
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,407
The muscles feel tense.

573
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,503
Let me give you a massage.

574
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:26,790
Don't.

575
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,095
What's wrong?

576
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,904
- Just go.
- What?

577
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,140
It'll get awkward if you keep this up.

578
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Do you feel awkward?

579
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,724
Of course. Why are you pushing me away?

580
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,814
What are you talking about?

581
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:41,703
You get some rest.

582
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:44,576
- Jun Woo.
- What?

583
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,088
What's this?

584
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,522
What is it?

585
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,764
Is this news related to my brother
and Producer Gang?

586
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,812
Backroom deals?

587
00:35:56,456 --> 00:36:00,371
Who would write a speculative
article without facts?

588
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:04,219
Is this throwing out whatever
to see if it lands?

589
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,994
What are we going to do?

590
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:08,945
I had a bad feeling about Producer Gang.

591
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:11,308
Then this happens.

592
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,011
Boss.

593
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:15,970
- What's wrong?
- Look at this article.

594
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,970
What is it?

595
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:19,803
What is this talking about?

596
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,045
Backroom deals with the Chief?

597
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:24,917
It says you colluded with Chief Ko...

598
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,807
and rigged the drama selection...

599
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,253
and how you're covering the ferry issue...

600
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:32,063
by promoting the city drama on it.

601
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:40,283
Chief Ko, we're the Audit Team.

602
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:42,204
What brings you here?

603
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,594
We received a report concerning you.

604
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:46,147
Please cooperate in our investigation.

605
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:48,116
What?

606
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,112
(Gang Min Ju)

607
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:48,230
Chief Ko.

608
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,990
Yes? What is it?

609
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,150
I'm worried about you.

610
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,374
Did you stay behind to say that?

611
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Yes.

612
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,628
Is everything all right?

613
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,351
Yes.

614
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,714
I'm fine.

615
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:07,875
That's good.

616
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,291
The truth always comes out,

617
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,961
so don't worry.

618
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,281
Okay.

619
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:15,882
You must be stressed about it.

620
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:18,739
So I'm determined to take you...

621
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:21,185
and hit the movies today.

622
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:23,418
What? "Hit" the movies?

623
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,721
I've already booked the tickets,

624
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,068
so you can't turn me down.

625
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,978
Just this once.

626
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:32,701
You can relax watching it with me, okay?

627
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:39,519
Then, you'd better listen to me
after this one time.

628
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,505
Producer Gang.

629
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:56,516
Hello.

630
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,794
I saw the article. You okay?

631
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:02,290
I can't believe that reporter.

632
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,194
It doesn't bother me,

633
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:06,419
but I'm worried about Chief Ko.

634
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:09,673
You're more my concern than him.

635
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:12,434
I'm a producer,
but he works in the government.

636
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,042
Goodness.

637
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,801
I hear Woori City cut your budget.

638
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,516
Yes, I don't know what happened.

639
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,357
Do you want me to lend a hand?

640
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:24,483
How?

641
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:27,670
I could talk to my school buddy there.

642
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,755
You mean Director Shin?

643
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,821
Yes, he could give some assistance.

644
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:36,158
Then I won't refuse your offer.

645
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:38,109
I'm not asking for more funds,

646
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,982
but just what was promised.

647
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:41,712
All right.

648
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,581
But if it works out, let's have drinks.

649
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:45,695
Fine.

650
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,503
Okay, take care.

651
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,357
- Here? This spot?
- That hurts.

652
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,620
It's right here.

653
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,937
Goodness.

654
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:57,881
Stay still, I'll stick it on.

655
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,720
Come on, don't act like such a baby.

656
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,206
I'm not. Yesterday shook me.

657
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:11,777
Yes, I'm glad you're back alive.

658
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:14,723
What about your waist?

659
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:18,148
Forget it. What are you doing?

660
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,661
But your waist...

661
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,089
I said forget it.

662
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:25,874
What's there to hide after our night?

663
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:30,361
Are you treating me as old junk
after one night together?

664
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,772
Old junk?

665
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,750
That makes me a junk collector.

666
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,402
- The junkman.
- Good grief.

667
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:41,020
How many women have you been with?

668
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,843
Let me think.

669
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,390
I can't count them all.

670
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,048
You're unbelievable.

671
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:48,377
Why would they even matter?

672
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:51,025
I care about the woman before my eyes.

673
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:53,075
Nothing gets better than that.

674
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,515
The past doesn't matter.

675
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,528
Why wouldn't it matter?

676
00:40:57,528 --> 00:41:01,329
My late husband was my first
and last love.

677
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:02,732
Your last love?

678
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,194
Then, what about me? What am I?

679
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,460
You're just someone I enjoy.

680
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:18,457
What's so funny?

681
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:24,088
Goodness, seeing you like this...

682
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:28,415
is too adorable not to laugh.

683
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:30,067
Stop, that hurts.

684
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:35,544
It's a miracle that you're back alive.

685
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:37,999
I panicked seeing the news.

686
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:41,508
But all that mess was worth something.

687
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:42,508
What do you mean?

688
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:46,269
Now I know how Chief Ko feels.

689
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,069
That's good.

690
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:50,414
Then, are you moving back?

691
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:51,798
I don't know.

692
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:54,462
Perhaps being away isn't so bad.

693
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:55,854
Join him already,

694
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:58,258
whether it's sharing a home
or sharing your bed.

695
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,942
I always see you taking energy drinks.

696
00:42:01,942 --> 00:42:05,200
Yes, it's what we need at our age.

697
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,503
If you want to survive a hailstorm,

698
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:09,678
you need to start taking this stuff.

699
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,397
Goodness.

700
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:14,183
Do you like the guy you're seeing now?

701
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,690
He's too naive to be fun,

702
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:19,574
but I like that innocence.

703
00:42:19,574 --> 00:42:23,559
He's coming this way. I'll introduce him.

704
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,783
Really? I'm excited.

705
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:27,336
You said he's in global trade?

706
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,976
He exports various products.

707
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:31,425
Are you sure he's single?

708
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:35,064
Of course. Why would I date a married guy?

709
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:36,593
I don't want to wreck a family.

710
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:38,370
After getting married and divorced,

711
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,082
I'm sure she did her research.

712
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:52,385
But what's taking him?

713
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,343
Isn't she the neighbor?

714
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,465
Why is she here?

715
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,440
I can't believe this.

716
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,663
Hello, Ae Gyeong.

717
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:19,557
Where are you? My friends are waiting.

718
00:43:19,557 --> 00:43:21,829
Something urgent came up.

719
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:23,109
I'm really sorry.

720
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:25,911
I'll call you back later.

721
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:27,047
Okay.

722
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,598
Can't he come today?

723
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,246
Something came up.

724
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:36,438
Goodness, I got excited about nothing.

725
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:38,030
I know. Next time.

726
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:43,359
Where are you now?

727
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,700
Really?

728
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,452
Then, I'll see you later.

729
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:47,511
Okay.

730
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:50,757
Is that your first love and student?

731
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:51,809
That's right.

732
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:56,760
Min Ju, you get home first.

733
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,818
I came here because your class
with Hun finished nearby.

734
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:03,433
I'll be meeting my guy later.

735
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,143
But it's too early.

736
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,552
How about we watch a movie?

737
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:07,905
Well, sure.

738
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,019
Excuse me.

739
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:17,210
Here you go.

740
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:20,037
My word.

741
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:22,477
Isn't that Chief Ko?

742
00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:26,154
Goodness, it's like a dream.

743
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:29,148
This is our movie date together.

744
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:33,792
Don't book without asking next time.

745
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:37,507
Then will you come along?

746
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,850
No.

747
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,022
Exactly.

748
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:48,245
Where are you?

749
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:51,962
All right?

750
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:54,311
Do you need to go?

751
00:44:54,311 --> 00:44:57,008
He's waiting for me at the sports center.

752
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:58,171
Then, let's go.

753
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:02,534
What's this, what's your problem?

754
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,345
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

755
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,907
The movie is starting.

756
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:21,728
Ms. Han, how about we sit here?

757
00:45:21,728 --> 00:45:22,728
Okay.

758
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:34,217
Thanks for a fun night.

759
00:45:35,918 --> 00:45:37,984
I couldn't ask for anything more.

760
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,647
Ms. Han.

761
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:47,693
Yes?

762
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,473
You promised to hear me out after.

763
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:51,605
Right.

764
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:56,066
I'm sorry that I have to say this.

765
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:01,469
But there is someone very special to me,

766
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,002
so I can't accept your feelings anymore.

767
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,419
Chief Ko.

768
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,912
I know you will be hurt,

769
00:46:11,912 --> 00:46:15,013
but I have to tell you this.

770
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:18,700
Don't get your hopes up about me.

771
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:22,515
You will only become upset.

772
00:46:24,496 --> 00:46:28,434
You mean like in the article,

773
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,234
are you involved with that person?

774
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:37,411
That's how I feel.

775
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:05,618
Where are you now?

776
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:07,987
Where?

777
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:11,003
Okay, I'll be there.

778
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:21,877
Thanks for not leaving.

779
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:28,281
You see...

780
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:33,813
I had to accompany her reluctantly.

781
00:47:33,813 --> 00:47:36,336
Then I explained that it has to stop.

782
00:47:38,518 --> 00:47:39,943
She must be upset.

783
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:41,877
So I made sure she went home.

784
00:47:43,933 --> 00:47:45,367
You called today.

785
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,415
Did you read the article?

786
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:49,670
Yes, I did.

787
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:52,451
Is everything all right?

788
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:54,326
Who cares if everything's not all right?

789
00:47:57,804 --> 00:47:59,213
You've changed a great deal.

790
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:06,648
Do you have the time to come
with me somewhere?

791
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:09,681
(Woori Cave Theater)

792
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,679
What are we doing here?

793
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:15,448
It's my fault that you missed a movie.

794
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:18,218
This way. You can be the first customer.

795
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:19,277
It's over here.

796
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:22,820
What a nice ambiance.

797
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:27,714
But it's not even officially open.

798
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:30,886
You were out to see a movie,
so let's do that.

799
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:42,733
Wait here.

800
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:56,437
Here.

801
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:00,658
Are we really watching it here?

802
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:04,768
Not sure if you'd like it, but let's see.

803
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,881
Okay, there it starts.

804
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:19,274
("Breakfast at Tiffany's")

805
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:18,070
(The End)

806
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:28,368
What should I give up?

807
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:34,993
My guilt about the past?

808
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:37,749
No.

809
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:41,465
My family?

810
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:44,766
No.

811
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:48,265
Then, my pride?

812
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:52,080
Did your pride stand in the way?

813
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,166
No.

814
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:57,325
I mean...

815
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:02,551
This is just enough.

816
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:05,099
I'm fine with this much.

817
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,073
I want to see you closer.

818
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,105
We are close.

819
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,659
No.

820
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:25,065
I want to live closer.

821
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:26,269
So...

822
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:35,124
Please move back.

823
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:47,036
Was saying that...

824
00:52:48,808 --> 00:52:50,211
so difficult for you?

825
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,169
Yes.

826
00:52:57,897 --> 00:53:01,386
It's even harder than crossing
the suspension bridge.

827
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:10,532
What about now?

828
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,380
Are you done crossing it?

829
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:17,757
No.

830
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,125
We can cross it together.

831
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,989
That way,

832
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,353
I won't get scared and feel easier.

833
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:12,422
What was that?

834
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:15,427
No way.

835
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:16,566
Are you okay?

836
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:19,819
Why did you get me a beer?

837
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:22,772
I had some myself, but you burped alone.

838
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,223
But you hardly had any.

839
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,795
Don't worry, it's just us two.

840
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,366
Your membership card disappeared?

841
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:46,607
I wanted to work out waiting for you,

842
00:54:46,607 --> 00:54:47,918
but mine couldn't be found.

843
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,385
Who would even take it?

844
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:04,033
Why? Does someone come to mind?

845
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,553
No.

846
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:09,010
Maybe someone liked my photo.

847
00:55:09,446 --> 00:55:10,446
Who?

848
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:12,836
It could be another woman.

849
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:15,686
Maybe she has a crush on me and took it.

850
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,704
Should I be jealous now?

851
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:22,229
Are you?

852
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:24,017
Well, just a little.

853
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,215
Ae Gyeong, I can't come here anymore.

854
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:34,634
What? Why?

855
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:36,036
I don't have a membership card.

856
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,940
I can make you another.

857
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,058
No, don't do that.

858
00:55:42,678 --> 00:55:45,528
Let's meet outside now.

859
00:55:46,182 --> 00:55:50,248
You seem naive and yet sly at other times.

860
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,851
That makes you attractive.

861
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:00,001
Let's go now.

862
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:16,430
Are you busy?

863
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,430
No.

864
00:56:18,486 --> 00:56:20,458
Check this out. It's fun.

865
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:26,238
This? I read it with you before.

866
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:27,723
It's a good read.

867
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:29,753
What's it about?

868
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:32,449
What did you like about it?

869
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:33,793
Come on.

870
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:36,009
Two friends who grew up together...

871
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:38,092
hide their feelings for each other.

872
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:42,307
You should still read it.

873
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:45,442
It hits you differently from before.

874
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:47,074
Okay, leave it there.

875
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,945
Sure. I'll put it here.

876
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:50,945
All right.

877
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:09,140
(I have something to say.
Come to my room if you're curious.)

878
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:11,137
What do you need to tell me?

879
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:15,775
You see...

880
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,655
It's okay.

881
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:19,848
No worries.

882
00:57:19,848 --> 00:57:22,666
You can tell me anything.

883
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:26,314
I can't exercise with you next weekend.

884
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:27,987
Why?

885
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:31,382
There was a girl I liked on a blind date,

886
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:32,712
and she called me.

887
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:34,632
Really?

888
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:39,653
That's good. What's her profession?

889
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:40,869
She's a dentist.

890
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:43,275
Dentist?

891
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:46,638
We have similar hobbies,
and she has a nice personality.

892
00:57:46,638 --> 00:57:48,150
Then, why didn't you meet her?

893
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,887
Marriage isn't on her mind.

894
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,929
She left quickly after
her parents forced her to come.

895
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:55,797
Is she pretty? What's her age?

896
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:58,102
She's 31.

897
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:00,786
And her beauty stands out.

898
00:58:02,943 --> 00:58:04,213
I hope it works out.

899
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:06,726
Are you upset I can't exercise?

900
00:58:06,726 --> 00:58:09,040
Of course not.

901
00:58:10,732 --> 00:58:13,534
I thought I'd date someone before,

902
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:14,671
but you beat me to it.

903
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:17,581
Are you finished eating?

904
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:20,553
Yes, it's hard to digest.

905
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:24,494
Then, I'll take you home.

906
00:58:24,494 --> 00:58:25,809
No, it's okay.

907
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:29,335
You know I love the subway.

908
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:31,367
I can get home alone.

909
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:32,369
Okay.

910
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:39,371
Where were you last night?

911
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:41,792
Where are you? Why aren't you home?

912
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,748
What? My brother's house?

913
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:46,372
Why are you even there?

914
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:48,079
Is that your hideout?

915
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:54,452
How dare you mess with someone
sweet like a little lamb?

916
00:58:54,452 --> 00:58:55,750
You're dead meat.

917
00:58:59,483 --> 00:59:01,932
Mom, where are you going? It's Sunday.

918
00:59:01,932 --> 00:59:03,475
To declare war.

919
00:59:03,475 --> 00:59:04,754
Dad didn't come home again?

920
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,662
Son, make sure you eat well.

921
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:12,785
Okay?

922
00:59:14,874 --> 00:59:15,796
Okay.

923
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:19,983
Mom.

924
00:59:22,182 --> 00:59:23,355
War?

925
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:27,881
I should wear more essence to look young.

926
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,520
- Thank you.
- You're meeting Chief Ko?

927
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,217
Yes, he wants to see me for something.

928
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:38,184
Just pretend to give in to him...

929
00:59:38,184 --> 00:59:39,723
and move back there.

930
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:43,814
This feels moist.

931
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:46,869
This is Ko Sang Sik.

932
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:49,852
I'd like to meet you today
if you have the time.

933
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:50,917
I'll wait for your answer.

934
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,121
What? Did he send it right?

935
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:56,576
Please don't tell Min Ju for her sake.

936
00:59:59,621 --> 01:00:00,621
What is it?

937
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:02,606
It's nothing.

938
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,431
My word.

939
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:15,228
What brings you here on a Sunday?

940
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:18,510
Do you have some time?

941
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,756
For what?

942
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:23,222
I want to take you somewhere.

943
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:26,358
Where?

944
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:31,206
Where are we going?

945
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:35,454
I wanted to buy you a treat.

946
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:37,349
It won't take long.

947
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:38,448
I see.

948
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,958
Min Ju's house is down this way.

949
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,845
Are you going home?

950
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:47,158
Yes, to my brother's house.

951
01:00:47,158 --> 01:00:49,583
There is a great treat waiting.

952
01:00:54,454 --> 01:00:56,440
Yes, I'm at the network.

953
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,609
At my house?

954
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,744
Yes, okay.

955
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,310
All right.

956
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:18,237
Thank you. Take care.

957
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:19,448
- Okay.
- Bye.

958
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:34,472
What? Did he read it already?

959
01:01:35,549 --> 01:01:36,722
I'm so nervous.

960
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:42,845
You're finished already?

961
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:44,637
It's quick with your brother.

962
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:45,649
I see.

963
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:52,357
Cheon Su.

964
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:55,377
Did you sleep here last night?

965
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,100
Yes.

966
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,101
Why?

967
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,572
What do you think?

968
01:02:00,572 --> 01:02:02,746
It's because of my nagging wife.

969
01:02:02,746 --> 01:02:04,412
She's always on my case...

970
01:02:04,412 --> 01:02:06,737
like there is nothing better to do.

971
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:09,643
You need a good beating.

972
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:14,027
You have the same temper as her.

973
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,561
What's going on?

974
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:32,210
Why is my stuff here?

975
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:34,856
Welcome back.

976
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:37,767
Furniture rots when stored away for long.

977
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:39,951
How did you do this?

978
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:41,483
Your friend helped me.

979
01:02:43,463 --> 01:02:44,663
Do you mean Tae Yeon?

980
01:02:44,663 --> 01:02:46,712
What a great friend you have.

981
01:02:50,943 --> 01:02:53,727
Didn't you see the note in there?

982
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:55,919
There wasn't anything like that.

983
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:57,802
What did you want to tell me?

984
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:02,883
There is something to say.

985
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:05,306
I need it off my chest now.

986
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:06,306
Sang Sik.

987
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:08,388
Hello.

988
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:11,564
We can talk it out at the house.

989
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:13,347
Please let go.

990
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:15,027
Are you guilty about something?

991
01:03:15,027 --> 01:03:16,473
Sang Hee, what's going on?

992
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:17,754
Min Ju.

993
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:18,754
Ae Gyeong.

994
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:26,837
Ae Gyeong.

995
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:27,879
Richard?

996
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:36,393
Richard?

997
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:38,514
You're showing your true colors!

998
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,591
Richard? Come here!

999
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:41,870
Good heavens.

1000
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,186
Richard? He's my husband!

1001
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:46,357
- What?
- What are you doing?

1002
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,360
- Ae Gyeong, are you okay?
- No.

1003
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,391
Wait! Park Cheon Su!

1004
01:03:51,391 --> 01:03:52,720
You come here!

1005
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:54,738
Let me go!

1006
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:05,877
