1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,328
Have you seen this before?

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,381
Where did you get that?

3
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:23,893
It's something my boyfriend left behind.

4
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,107
The one I talked about.

5
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:27,233
By the way...

6
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:30,265
What was his name?

7
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,625
Eun Ho.

8
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:37,256
Jang Eun Ho.

9
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:45,896
- Eun Ho, no!
- Sang Sik.

10
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,549
No.

11
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:54,320
Sang Sik.

12
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,529
- No, Eun Ho!
- Sang Sik.

13
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,380
Hurry and escape.

14
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,550
Sang Sik.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,127
Don't let go!

16
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:07,565
Eun Ho!

17
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,453
Eun Ho!

18
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,943
Eun Ho!

19
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:27,494
What's wrong?

20
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:37,109
The truth is...

21
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:39,126
Sang Sik.

22
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:42,203
Min Ju.

23
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,895
You don't look too well.

24
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:04,468
Well.

25
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:05,767
No, I'm okay.

26
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,190
Min Ju, what are you doing here?

27
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,302
You see...

28
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,690
I guess it's something important.

29
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,086
No, I have something to ask him.

30
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:25,398
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:29,021
Well, it's Sang Hee's wedding anniversary.

32
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,999
But I can't get in touch with Cheon Su.

33
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,095
So I prepared a little party.

34
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,377
Jun Woo.

35
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,379
You go ahead. I'll join later.

36
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,185
Then I'll let you talk.

37
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:09,889
This thing.

38
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,044
The moment my boyfriend died,

39
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,481
he was holding it tightly.

40
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,963
His dream was to be a camera director.

41
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:34,025
But there was a fire during a shoot.

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,335
Only he ended up dead.

43
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:46,001
I wondered why it had to be him.

44
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,929
Why it had to happen to me.

45
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,053
That's what...

46
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:04,010
I resented the most.

47
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,277
I had never seen it before,

48
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,468
so it always made me curious.

49
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,347
"Where did it come from?"

50
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,171
"Who gave it to him?"

51
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,452
"Who did he get it from?"

52
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,007
Well...

53
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:40,502
My wife made it for me.

54
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,037
They look the same.

55
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,413
I see.

56
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:09,148
I'll go now.

57
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:10,159
Wait.

58
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:20,642
How about we grab a drink?

59
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,255
(Second to Last Love)

60
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,968
(Episode 10)

61
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,934
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

62
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,687
Happy 18th anniversary.

63
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,767
Forget it.

64
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,799
My husband married me, not you guys.

65
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,343
Come on.

66
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,095
He'll be here soon.

67
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:56,423
My husband doesn't even know
if today means anything.

68
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,245
Who doesn't know?

69
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,924
- Cheon Su.
- Dad.

70
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:01,924
Uncle.

71
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,405
Today is our wedding anniversary.

72
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:08,037
Then you should come earlier.
Look how late it is.

73
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,500
You knew, and yet you came home late?

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,301
Even without a gift?

75
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:14,637
You know I hate formalities.

76
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:17,456
I think it's better to celebrate
when it's from the heart.

77
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,228
Sang Hee, today is special.

78
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,165
You should take a love shot
with your husband.

79
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,039
And this couple as well.

80
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,677
Yes, you're better off than us.

81
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,009
Your love is way more beautiful.

82
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:46,256
Okay, let's raise our glasses.

83
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,794
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

84
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,234
Congratulations.

85
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,677
For what?

86
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:58,528
I wish you happiness throughout your days.

87
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,850
Thank you.

88
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,077
Come on, what's all the fuss?

89
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,898
Come on, Uncle.

90
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:12,743
Love shot!

91
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:13,839
Do we have to?

92
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,183
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

93
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,357
Now let's do ours.

94
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,636
I told you I hate formalities.

95
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:25,568
It should come from the heart.

96
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,481
- Sang Hee.
- Excuse me.

97
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,393
- Sang Hee.
- Sang Hee.

98
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:33,679
Sang Hee.

99
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:36,313
Marriage is as confusing as dating.

100
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:38,626
You should hurry to her.

101
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,458
Okay.

102
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:45,961
Will she be okay?

103
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,517
Cheon Su will take care of it.

104
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:51,051
Here.

105
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:53,525
Still, I'm relieved.

106
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:55,982
It's a huge relief.

107
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:00,663
That Jun Woo is with her now.

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,108
What's with you these days?

109
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:12,293
Can't you see me? Are you blind?

110
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,476
Be quiet. They can hear you.

111
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:18,523
My husband doesn't give a care about me.

112
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:21,924
I'm so embarrassed today.

113
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:24,356
What's in an anniversary, anyway?

114
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,595
What counts is that we have
this peaceful life.

115
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,003
"Peaceful?"

116
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:31,836
I'm fuming with anger.

117
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,658
I can't believe how my life turned out.

118
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,832
Then what about my life?

119
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,095
Does anyone even care about me?

120
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,033
I work my backside off every day,

121
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,017
but not a single soul shows gratitude.

122
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,570
Do you know what kids say about me?

123
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,612
"Are you Cheon Su because you teach math?"

124
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,386
"At least it's better than Baek Su.
Is your brother Man Su?"

125
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:52,211
It's nothing new with them
picking at your name.

126
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:54,245
Why do you even care?

127
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,827
Forget it.

128
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:00,557
I can't even hold a meaningful
conversation with you.

129
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,190
- What did you say?
- Good grief.

130
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:06,231
Conversation?

131
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,653
I can't bear it!

132
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,066
- Thanks for the treat.
- Just leave it.

133
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,214
I'm worried Sang Heed didn't eat anything.

134
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:19,822
Cheon Su should know better.

135
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:21,854
She's lamenting about it to Min Ju.

136
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:25,624
That doesn't look good.

137
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,138
Something's up.

138
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:41,331
Is something bothering you?

139
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,133
No, it's nothing.

140
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:52,171
What did Min Ju ask you earlier?

141
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,114
Jun Woo.

142
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:04,450
If I ever did something wrong...

143
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,645
to someone you like,

144
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,380
could you forgive me?

145
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,997
What...

146
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,317
What are you talking about?

147
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,355
I mean, if that ever happens.

148
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,515
You know, just in case.

149
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,556
I don't think that's likely,

150
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,549
but even if it does happen,

151
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:29,117
I'll understand and take your side.

152
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:34,092
You must have a valid reason for it.

153
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,078
I see.

154
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,477
Sang Hee.

155
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,526
You should be with your husband
on this special day.

156
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,719
I can't bear to look at him.

157
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,792
Thank you.

158
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:06,424
Still, it must be nice to have a family.

159
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,425
You seem happy.

160
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:12,698
I envy what you have.

161
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:14,460
Really?

162
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,622
You made it living on your own
and achieved your dream.

163
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:23,359
I heard this from someone.

164
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,996
Being single is like dull Heaven...

165
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:30,789
while being married is like fun Hell.

166
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:33,526
That's interesting.

167
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,007
I'm in dull Heaven,

168
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:39,246
but you're in fun Hell.

169
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,926
You can't really say which is better.

170
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,262
It's just a matter of choice.

171
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:46,500
But if I had to choose again,

172
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,894
I'd prefer fun Hell.

173
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,002
It seems I'm destined to marry.

174
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,156
That settles it.

175
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,417
But I once had dreams.

176
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,991
I wanted a life playing the piano.

177
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,409
That sounds amazing.

178
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,708
My husband fell in love with me
when he saw me play.

179
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:11,797
But I didn't expect to grow old
as a housewife like this.

180
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,268
I once thought I'd be married...

181
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:21,173
and live a normal, happy life.

182
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,251
But who knew I'd end up alone?

183
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,110
Really?

184
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,956
- Sang Sik.
- Sit down.

185
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,644
You're better than this.

186
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,417
I long to see my wife but can't.

187
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:10,369
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:19,434
This life I have,

189
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,244
it's unbearably lonely and hard.

190
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,371
No one seems to understand.

191
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,014
Even after forty years,

192
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,093
I have nothing to show for it.

193
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,030
I'm left with nothing.

194
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,415
Nothing?

195
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:42,214
Well, I guess.

196
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,936
I'm not looking for an affair at this age.

197
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:52,654
I just want to pour out my heart
to anyone who'd listen.

198
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:55,750
But I don't have such friends.

199
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:58,914
And I definitely can't talk to my family.

200
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:03,340
So realizing there wasn't anyone
that I could talk to,

201
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,917
it's like there is a hole in my heart.

202
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:10,532
Right.

203
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,124
We're at that age.

204
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,772
Life is hectic, yet it feels empty.

205
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,573
With so much to take care of,
it's hard to breathe.

206
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,490
How did you bear it all those years?

207
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,884
Your wife even passed away.

208
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,357
I'd be lying to say it wasn't hard.

209
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,268
Times were unbearable.

210
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,179
But watching Ye Ji grow up,

211
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:51,569
I told myself to manage...

212
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,262
and pulled myself together.

213
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,674
I reminded myself time and again.

214
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,262
I know that well.

215
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,785
You are really something.

216
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,780
But you know how I feel?

217
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,084
I don't want to live in doubt like this.

218
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:09,713
I'd rather be called crazy
and live that way.

219
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:12,319
I want to be called a fool
and live foolishly.

220
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,386
No.

221
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:17,137
You have Hun and Sang Hee.

222
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:19,987
So get your act together.

223
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,196
All right.

224
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,267
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,874
We somehow matured into adults...

226
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,116
and give solace to the young.

227
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,889
But whether married,

228
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:44,675
single,

229
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,505
or even widowed,

230
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:53,453
we are still searching
for life's answers...

231
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,127
and are perhaps lost forever.

232
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,383
We somehow matured into adults,

233
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:09,102
but our hearts still ache
for the love that once burned.

234
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,912
And saddened by moments
that can't be relived,

235
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:17,803
we may be battling bitter loneliness.

236
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,122
Somehow, beneath our gaze,

237
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,674
love might be there, unknown to us.

238
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,194
(Woori City Hall)

239
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,761
Yes, what's it about?

240
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,424
On the ferry?

241
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:00,537
How could this happen?

242
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,946
There comes Chief Ko.

243
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,999
- Hello.
- Hello. What happened?

244
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,359
Chief Ko, my son was in trouble.

245
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,175
He was dragged on board by thugs...

246
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,810
and got beaten awfully badly.

247
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,545
They are scoundrels.

248
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:15,712
Who knows if they drink or smoke in there?

249
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,920
What would happen if they start a fire?

250
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,193
How long will you keep it abandoned?

251
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,337
It would become a hangout for thugs,

252
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,493
which would only mean trouble.

253
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,418
Let me take a look.

254
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,186
That bastards.

255
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:48,224
Let's decide with a show of hands.

256
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:51,002
Who agrees with Ms. Ko?

257
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,338
I can't stand this.

258
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:00,335
How can you decide on creativity...

259
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:01,879
by majority rule?

260
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,552
I've seen all her webtoons,

261
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,863
but I don't like the characters or story.

262
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:10,543
Why won't you consider what I proposed?

263
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,568
I went over it ten times.

264
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:16,264
If we fail, will you be taking the blame?

265
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:18,056
- What?
- If that's not your plan,

266
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,012
you shouldn't voice your opinion.

267
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,781
My life and future depend on this work.

268
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,486
Hold on a minute.

269
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:27,143
We're all here trying to make a hit.

270
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:30,405
Fine, have it your way.

271
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,278
I'm out of here.

272
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,407
Wait.

273
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,887
Are you seriously leaving?

274
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,149
Yes. I'd rather work with someone...

275
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:43,701
who I can respect as a mentor...

276
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:46,168
or someone with great leadership.

277
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:52,160
Ms. Na, wait a minute.

278
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,118
I've got a question for my seven fans.

279
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,246
What is it now?

280
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,862
I thought you were doing well
at the network.

281
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,982
A drama writer stormed out
because of me today.

282
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:14,966
- My goodness...
- Just leave it.

283
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,660
Work solo. What's the problem?

284
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,836
I only know how to script webtoons.

285
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:22,252
I'm not a drama writer.

286
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:25,476
I want this project to succeed
for my brother's sake.

287
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:27,782
Then convince her to come back.

288
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,812
She's a goner. Get a new writer.

289
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:30,908
Ask her back.

290
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:31,917
Find a new writer.

291
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,195
Work alone.

292
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:35,052
- I don't know.
- You decide.

293
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,740
I can't believe you people.

294
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,452
What are you up to, Mi Rye?

295
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,194
Nothing much.

296
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,869
Are you stressed about Ms. Na leaving?

297
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:59,811
Well, I can't say it doesn't bother me.

298
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,555
I really want to make this work.

299
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,550
So what if we fail?

300
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:12,498
Then something new will open up.

301
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:14,106
What?

302
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,852
I desperately want this as well.

303
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:21,375
If I lose any more ground,

304
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,574
I might even have to retire.

305
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:25,481
Then why would you say that?

306
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,664
So what if things don't work out?

307
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,503
Taking that perspective...

308
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,319
gives you courage when you are in doubt.

309
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,742
So what if I'm poor?

310
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:42,804
So what if I'm old?

311
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:44,811
So what if I'm not qualified?

312
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,664
So what if I'm not dating?
So what if I fail?

313
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:50,948
These words.

314
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,293
They take off the pressure
and get you to try.

315
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,508
That's true.

316
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:03,049
So what if I fail?

317
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,104
I'll keep doing this work.

318
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,583
No matter who tries to hold me back.

319
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:15,549
Boss.

320
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,550
You're a great mentor of mine.

321
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,529
And I see you as an excellent leader.

322
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:22,727
No.

323
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:27,040
I wanted to be such an adult,

324
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,634
but I'm far from it.

325
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:32,691
I still keep stumbling.

326
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:50,224
Aren't you done with work?

327
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,805
You can head home.

328
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:57,168
This is what you asked about the ferry.

329
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:58,168
Right.

330
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:04,200
- What's this?
- Chief Ko.

331
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,634
You haven't seen a movie in ages,
have you?

332
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:09,698
This film is popular with couples.

333
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:11,611
Even the middle-aged people love it.

334
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:12,845
No, thanks. You can take it back.

335
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,027
Maybe we can watch it together...

336
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:25,891
Okay.

337
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:30,849
Well.

338
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:39,899
Ta-da!

339
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,834
What's this?

340
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,097
The Top Ten Chef Festival sent
you an invitation.

341
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,582
- Are you for real?
- Of course.

342
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,365
You get to attend the banquet party

343
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,560
with the best chefs in the country.

344
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,551
(Invitation to the Top Ten Chef Festival)

345
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:05,971
When did you sign me up?

346
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:09,723
I got your profile and magazine articles,

347
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,052
and mailed them last week.

348
00:23:12,052 --> 00:23:13,991
You really wanted to go there.

349
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
This is unbelievable.

350
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:33,524
Great work on the meeting.

351
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:35,917
Let's start the interviews tomorrow.

352
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,307
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:38,381
- Boss.
- Yes?

354
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,682
Ms. Na isn't answering her phone.

355
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:41,933
It's one thing after another.

356
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,163
I'll see if she's home today.

357
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:45,234
Let me join you.

358
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:49,196
That's okay. You worry about your date.

359
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,090
- You can head out first.
- Okay.

360
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:01,048
Are you free after work?

361
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:04,300
I have great news and want to celebrate.

362
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,134
What's the good news?

363
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,445
I'll tell you in person.

364
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:14,619
Sorry.

365
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,869
Tonight isn't really good for me.

366
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,630
Got it. See you when you get back.

367
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,093
Okay.

368
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,187
Next time, let's hit a bar for drinks.

369
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:35,782
Okay, thanks.

370
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:37,294
Hello.

371
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:39,921
We meet again.

372
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:43,702
With the upcoming drama selection,

373
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,866
you shouldn't be meeting with producers.

374
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,351
What are you talking about?

375
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:51,729
My old school friend was just in the area.

376
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:52,883
Then what's that you have?

377
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:57,102
This? It's just a promotional pamphlet.

378
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,084
Do you think I'm hiding something?

379
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,724
Like a secret document?

380
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:03,853
Good grief.

381
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,453
Do you mind if we have a talk?

382
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,069
Is this about the plagiarism issue?

383
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:16,777
I'm sorry about that.

384
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:20,402
But we issued an apology,

385
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:23,690
and your sister now works at the network.

386
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,235
Producer Gang made that happen.

387
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,235
Right.

388
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,468
I guess you know, being her neighbor.

389
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:32,943
Hold on.

390
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:36,095
Where should I meet you?

391
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:40,747
Is Producer Han nearby?

392
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,139
Yes, I'll pick up the documents...

393
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,669
and visit Ms. Na with you.

394
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,669
Okay.

395
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:48,816
Sorry.

396
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:53,149
So what do you want to say?

397
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:55,823
Eun Ho.

398
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:58,511
Do you remember him?

399
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,060
Jang Eun Ho.

400
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,532
Why are you mentioning him?

401
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:12,118
It was "Paradise for Youth" on KBN.

402
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:14,968
Yes, I know. I directed it.

403
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:20,144
Eun Ho was a great loss.

404
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:28,097
Do you still harbor resentment about that?

405
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:30,085
No, I don't.

406
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,902
Then why are you bringing it up?

407
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,033
At the time,

408
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,717
he was going to marry someone.

409
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:41,206
Was it Gang Min Ju?

410
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:52,914
Min Ju.

411
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:55,730
I'm really glad that you are...

412
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,477
dating someone again.

413
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,062
Why don't you date anyone?

414
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:03,075
I'm too lazy for that.

415
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,020
I'd rather rest on the weekends...

416
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,803
than doll up for a guy.

417
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,843
That's too much work.

418
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:12,644
Right? It gets harder with age.

419
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,594
You need to devote your time and energy,

420
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,980
and have him come to you first.

421
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,307
How much affection is needed for that?

422
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,630
Is it worth losing all your freedom?

423
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:28,990
When you can forget being lazy...

424
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,410
and put him above anything else,

425
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,165
that's when you know it's fate.

426
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,588
In my 20s, for the sake of my boyfriend,

427
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,948
I once washed my hair at 3 a.m.

428
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,859
He suddenly came over to my house.

429
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:47,036
So I got ready half-asleep.

430
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:50,283
Have you ever washed your hair
at 3 a.m. for a guy?

431
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:54,108
Yes, I've done worse. All sorts of stuff.

432
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:56,669
I see. Do you mean for Eun Ho?

433
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:03,547
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,284
I keep forgetting you've moved on.

435
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,056
It's okay.

436
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:10,138
If you don't mention him, who will?

437
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:13,941
You were my biggest support back then.

438
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:16,634
Looking back,

439
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:20,115
K Network handled it irresponsibly.

440
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,426
I know it was an accident,

441
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:24,090
but you never got an explanation.

442
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,752
They just blamed spontaneous combustion.

443
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:34,776
What about Eun Ho's mother?

444
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:38,566
She's in a nursing home,
but I haven't visited.

445
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:45,445
Min Ju, put it all behind you...

446
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:48,780
and focus on your new love.

447
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,976
Okay?

448
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,036
Yes.

449
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,975
Gang Min Ju and Jang Eun Ho
were to be married.

450
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:06,004
Are you still struggling with
guilt about that?

451
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,975
Or are you trying to blame me now?

452
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:11,725
It was an accident.

453
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,548
An accident?

454
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:16,180
I wasn't at the scene,

455
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,948
but thankfully it was cleared
as an accident quickly.

456
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:21,757
If it had come out that someone died
because we rushed the shoot,

457
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,100
who would have been accountable?

458
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,059
Why did you switch networks
if it was an accident?

459
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:27,704
You also left your job.

460
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:29,881
Did you expect me to stay
and face questioning?

461
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,954
You should have informed
the grieving family...

462
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:33,266
about what happened.

463
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,298
It's behind us now.

464
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,549
You're also doing well with other work.

465
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:41,413
Hello, Gang Min Ju.

466
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:46,077
I didn't expect to see you together.

467
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:48,809
I was visiting Director Shin.

468
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:51,139
Do you know him? He went to my school.

469
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,139
Yes.

470
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:59,354
Here. Take it easy on the work.

471
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:02,052
Fill me in if plans change.

472
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,115
Are these all the new actors?

473
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:05,958
I should hold an audition.

474
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,653
Where are you off to again?

475
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:09,013
I got something to take care of.

476
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,893
I'll leave you, then.

477
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:12,849
Okay.

478
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:28,643
Who'd have thought you're
the guy next door?

479
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:33,060
Anyway, I never mentioned what
happened to Gang Min Ju

480
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,239
and don't intend to tell her,
so keep it that way.

481
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,366
I'll get going.

482
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:51,059
Are you going to quit the team?

483
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,164
I can't take the pain anymore.

484
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,555
Ms. Na, nobody was favoring...

485
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,500
Ms. Ko over you about anything.

486
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,623
Enough. Leave it alone.

487
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,573
She should at least know why
after all this time.

488
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:06,652
You're full of pride and prejudice,

489
00:31:06,652 --> 00:31:10,638
and I refuse to be laid bare
and picked apart.

490
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,889
You have never revealed your true self.

491
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:18,437
What?

492
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:22,511
Why are you constantly hiding?

493
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:26,443
If the writer keeps masking everything,

494
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:29,294
how will the viewers understand
your true meaning?

495
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:38,421
Break out of your shell if you can.

496
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,425
If you continue hiding behind a mask,

497
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,057
I can't work with you anymore.

498
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,645
- Boss.
- How...

499
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,878
How did you know?

500
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:55,779
You know, I've been married twice,

501
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,426
and I've got a daughter who's six.

502
00:31:57,426 --> 00:31:59,452
Yes, I'm a writer trying to scrape by.

503
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,467
I asked myself, is this all I have?

504
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,411
Why can't I write any better?

505
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,583
And when I looked at Mi Rye,

506
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,238
it felt like she was in a whole
different league,

507
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:13,763
and that was so annoying.

508
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:17,399
If it keeps going like this,

509
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,559
I'd shrink away to nothing.

510
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,698
And I can't bear that.

511
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:39,093
How'd you know? You never miss the mark.

512
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:42,108
How could I not know after
all that time working?

513
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:43,910
It shows in Ms. Na's writing.

514
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,652
She was acting all tough with me...

515
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:49,373
because of her low confidence
after getting a divorce,

516
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:52,271
so she put on a front to hide it.

517
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:55,681
I'm relieved she'll be back
after gathering herself.

518
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,175
- Gang Min Ju.
- Hello.

519
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:02,424
You called just in time.

520
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:04,599
What were you discussing with Chief Ko?

521
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,688
It was nothing much.

522
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,673
I ran into him since he works
for Director Shin.

523
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:12,032
Are you sure there is nothing else?

524
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,587
What would I have going on with him?

525
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,250
Then what made you call?

526
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,446
I wanted to ask you something.

527
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,413
What's between you and Chief Ko?

528
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,371
What are you saying?

529
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,754
Isn't he the guy who lives next door?

530
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:31,013
He must be your boyfriend.

531
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:35,437
Yes, he's my boyfriend. So what?

532
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,765
Good heavens.

533
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:41,382
All right, then.

534
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,270
What?

535
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:48,484
Maybe Producer Han has a crush on you.

536
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,315
- What? No way.
- Good grief.

537
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:54,676
What if he gets divorced and pursues you?

538
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:57,962
I heard he already got divorced.

539
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:59,629
What? Really?

540
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:01,988
That's crazy.

541
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,994
You can drop me off there.

542
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:05,994
Okay.

543
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:16,776
- Min Ju.
- Hello.

544
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:17,921
Did everything go well with work?

545
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:21,143
Yes, but what's the good news?

546
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:25,143
Well, be sure to make time this weekend.

547
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,971
I've been accepted
by the top chefs' group.

548
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,953
Really?

549
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:33,712
It's like the national team in sports.

550
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:36,289
Congratulations. That's amazing.

551
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,971
You're the real deal, chef.

552
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,807
I wanted to share it with you first...

553
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:44,073
and waited up for you.

554
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:47,745
Let's celebrate this weekend
at the members' party.

555
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:50,819
Okay. I'll be there.

556
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,011
I'll get going.

557
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:56,832
Okay.

558
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:05,675
("Paradise for Youth")

559
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,667
Gang Min Ju and Jang Eun Ho
were to be married.

560
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:36,952
- Good work.
- Good job, everybody.

561
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,416
Eun Ho, help me with this.

562
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,878
Okay, I'm coming.

563
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:42,207
- What needs to be done?
- Put this here.

564
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,940
Now that's a cool bracelet.

565
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,785
- Is it from your wife?
- That's right.

566
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:50,788
Good grief, I want to get married already.

567
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,806
I envy you so much.

568
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:53,295
I heard you set the date.

569
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:55,137
You have to come.

570
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:57,245
Come and see my beautiful bride.

571
00:35:57,245 --> 00:35:59,685
Of course, congratulations.

572
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:08,419
What's an assistant director?

573
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,570
You take responsibility when I'm away.

574
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:15,218
Sang Sik, you shoot this last scene.

575
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:19,199
Look, there's been an issue with Team B.

576
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,968
I have to hurry, so roll till the end.

577
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:24,090
Work hard.

578
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,208
Hurry, get out!

579
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:39,939
Get out!

580
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:42,762
Get out!

581
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,439
Eun Ho!

582
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,104
Eun Ho! No!

583
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,582
No!

584
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:03,550
Hurry and escape.

585
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,760
Don't let go!

586
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:07,759
Eun Ho!

587
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,727
Eun Ho!

588
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:21,798
If only we had stopped the shoot...

589
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:23,737
and not pushed ahead recklessly.

590
00:37:25,404 --> 00:37:26,609
If we had made that choice,

591
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,215
there would have been no accident.

592
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:10,836
Wait.

593
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:18,116
Just a second.

594
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,250
I know the city's historical sites...

595
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,248
are right here and here.

596
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:29,537
But I need to find someplace new...

597
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:32,649
to create a date scene in the drama.

598
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:36,215
This place looks empty without houses,

599
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:38,906
but it's dull over here as well.

600
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,372
Would this area work better?

601
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,436
How about this spot?

602
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,716
Good heavens, my bad.

603
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:58,147
I suppose asking you for help
wouldn't make it fair.

604
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:00,458
I shouldn't have even asked.

605
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,516
Gang Min Ju.

606
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:06,709
I'm sorry.

607
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:09,162
Yes?

608
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:11,532
For what?

609
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,931
I should have done something.

610
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:16,996
I'm sorry.

611
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:21,308
What are you talking about?

612
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:27,075
Ko Sang Sik.

613
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:33,818
Despite my position at Woori City Hall,

614
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:37,172
I can't provide any help. I'm sorry.

615
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,470
Look...

616
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:54,021
Is it going well?

617
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:55,968
Nope.

618
00:39:57,537 --> 00:39:58,537
Why not?

619
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:01,221
It's not going well.

620
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:05,078
The writer quit because of me.

621
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:06,093
What?

622
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:08,331
That's more load on my shoulders.

623
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:10,058
I'm scared I might fail.

624
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:11,971
That must be a lot of pressure.

625
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:13,271
Yes.

626
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:16,001
The lady next door...

627
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:18,781
I mean, my boss said this.

628
00:40:19,288 --> 00:40:21,345
"So what?"

629
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:22,361
What?

630
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,481
"So what if we can't do it?"

631
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:26,720
"So what if we fail?"

632
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,964
She said that these words give her
strength and courage.

633
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,105
So when it got frustrating,

634
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:35,841
I told myself, "So what?"

635
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:38,643
And it took the pressure off,
strangely enough.

636
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:41,796
I see.

637
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,252
You've got yourself a great boss.

638
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:48,311
She's pretty amazing.

639
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,873
That must be why Jun Woo likes her.

640
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:54,160
She seems like an excellent leader...

641
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,954
and a great mentor to her team.

642
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,085
My word, when will I ever be like that?

643
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,914
Why not me?

644
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:16,914
What do I even lack?

645
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,668
I like it here.

646
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,346
I'm never leaving.

647
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:21,804
Okay, next.

648
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,837
Thank you.

649
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:25,717
(Casting Audition for "Love and Cooking")

650
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,330
Finding fresh talent won't work.

651
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,072
- Let's give up.
- Why?

652
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,896
Even Producer Han cast Na Joo Yeon.

653
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:33,980
The other networks are likely the same.

654
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,645
Why are you here?

655
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:48,068
I'm here to audition.

656
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:51,656
Who is she?

657
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:52,941
The name is Min Ji Seon.

658
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:57,312
You can just leave. Next.

659
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:58,465
Wait a minute.

660
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:01,033
We don't have time. Send her out.

661
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,830
You can't be like this. Please go.

662
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,448
Why not me? What do I even lack?

663
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,770
I like it here.

664
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,517
I'm never leaving.

665
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,543
Okay?

666
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:42,921
Why did you come all this way
to cause trouble?

667
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,706
I was curious about how you work.

668
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,880
Your position, how you operate,

669
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,959
and what's so special about your life...

670
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,635
that made Jun fall for you.

671
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:54,528
So?

672
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,723
You're not so bad.

673
00:42:57,864 --> 00:43:00,169
Having the power to choose.

674
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:02,135
That makes me jealous.

675
00:43:02,135 --> 00:43:04,598
Your dream is to become a great model.

676
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:05,624
You can be that.

677
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,290
That's my work, not my dream.

678
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:10,686
My dream has ended.

679
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:14,312
I'm done with the cafe.

680
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,434
I don't work there anymore.

681
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:20,298
So you can date Jun as much as you want.

682
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:23,594
I don't think your dream is over.

683
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:25,299
You came to see me.

684
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:28,569
That's because you want to show presence.

685
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:29,800
To seek attention.

686
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,027
That's nonsense.

687
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:34,237
Take care.

688
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:37,410
Don't try so hard.

689
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,867
Having to try isn't love.

690
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,907
I can see through you.

691
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:16,691
Since it's Monday...

692
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:19,892
- My goodness.
- What?

693
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:22,817
Do you two know each other?

694
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:25,328
Of course. Did you bring her here?

695
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,778
Yes, she wanted a bar to drink alone.

696
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,140
To drink alone?

697
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,139
- Have a seat.
- No, thanks.

698
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,374
- I'll go somewhere else.
- But...

699
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:38,548
Wait a minute.

700
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,520
Did you have to use this as a coaster?

701
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,808
What's wrong?

702
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:50,849
You promised solid support
for the citizens.

703
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:52,966
But when your photo is used
as a solid coaster,

704
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:54,439
does it hurt your pride?

705
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:59,396
So what if you're the Deputy Mayor?

706
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,556
With your kids married off
and your husband gone,

707
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:05,439
you don't have anyone
to share drinks with.

708
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:11,015
That was written here.

709
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,572
So you did read it.

710
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:15,549
Please don't be like this.

711
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,945
What liquor do you have?

712
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,853
Those are my favorite instant noodles.

713
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,368
You can make some for me.

714
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:36,488
My word, why does my skin feel so saggy?

715
00:45:43,765 --> 00:45:45,960
I should put on more cream.

716
00:45:57,932 --> 00:46:01,630
Yeong Ae, email me all the documents.

717
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:09,434
Who is that?

718
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,355
Have you had dinner?

719
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,746
Not yet.

720
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:17,958
Come on, I've booked us a nice place.

721
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:21,338
- What?
- You wanted to go there.

722
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:23,564
It's that place.

723
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:26,435
But right now...

724
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:27,515
What is it?

725
00:46:27,515 --> 00:46:29,504
I have some work to do.

726
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,105
I see, really?

727
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:35,808
Okay, then.

728
00:46:35,808 --> 00:46:38,255
I'm sorry. You even made a reservation.

729
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,593
It's fine. Just get back to work.

730
00:46:58,407 --> 00:46:59,577
Why are you coming from there?

731
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,071
What brings you here this late?

732
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,288
- Didn't she say anything?
- About what?

733
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:07,232
I can't believe that woman.

734
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,290
Such a hypocrite.

735
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,092
Who are you calling that?

736
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:15,637
Gang Min Ju is a hypocrite.

737
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,291
She gets you more than anyone.

738
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,181
How could you even call her that?

739
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,258
She gets me? She?

740
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,107
Yes, more than me. Do you know that?

741
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:26,507
What does she even get?

742
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:27,771
She hardly knows me.

743
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:31,456
How you parting from me...

744
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:33,856
would make you feel cut
off from the world.

745
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:36,846
She asked me to understand because
you'd feel like all is over.

746
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:39,050
That know-it-all.

747
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,124
Min Ji Seon.

748
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:44,953
I don't want us to end.

749
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:46,886
This is killing me. It hurts.

750
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:52,462
But I'll go because I hate her.

751
00:47:55,195 --> 00:47:56,296
Ji Seon.

752
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:05,293
Thanks.

753
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:31,103
(Park Jun Woo)

754
00:48:31,103 --> 00:48:32,830
Jun Woo, I'm sorry.

755
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,062
You even made a reservation.

756
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:36,634
Next time...

757
00:48:47,622 --> 00:48:49,110
Hello, Yeong Ae.

758
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,661
Boss, I just emailed you.

759
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:52,983
I'll take a look.

760
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:54,767
Are you going to work from home?

761
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:55,966
Just like always.

762
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,431
Come on, get some dating time.

763
00:48:58,431 --> 00:49:00,535
I can't be dating right now.

764
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:04,255
Boss.

765
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:08,313
I'm sorry.

766
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:13,671
Until now, it's been all about me
and how I use my time,

767
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:17,094
but now I have to share it
with someone else.

768
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:18,617
That's hard to get used to.

769
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:21,493
That sounds like trouble.

770
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,092
What?

771
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,183
How much you're willing to compromise...

772
00:49:25,183 --> 00:49:28,158
shows how much you like the guy.

773
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:31,810
Consider what you can give up.

774
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:37,498
Okay. I'll hang up.

775
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,215
Thanks.

776
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,185
- I'll get these two.
- Okay.

777
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,459
Why the sudden change of heart?

778
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:11,312
Well, I was feeling bad about it,

779
00:50:12,237 --> 00:50:14,058
and work wasn't going well.

780
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:15,799
I see.

781
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:30,437
How do you like it?

782
00:50:30,437 --> 00:50:31,623
It's delicious.

783
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:35,449
I can't expect anything less
from a top ten chef's pick.

784
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:38,846
Would you like some wine?

785
00:50:38,846 --> 00:50:41,547
- You need to drive.
- Just for you.

786
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:42,547
Here.

787
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:46,284
Thanks.

788
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:52,540
- Just one glass.
- Okay.

789
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,515
Thanks.

790
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,530
The chefs' gathering this weekend
is a plus-one party.

791
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,581
Is that okay?

792
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:03,286
Yes.

793
00:51:12,484 --> 00:51:15,205
How did you like the restaurant?

794
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:37,382
Min Ju.

795
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:44,397
Did I fall asleep?

796
00:51:44,397 --> 00:51:47,952
You seemed tired, so I let you be.

797
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,442
Where are we?

798
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:51,540
Step outside.

799
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,598
What can I do?

800
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:07,965
I need to get back because
there is work left.

801
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,549
Yeong Ae, I'm outside right now.

802
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,642
No, I'll be home soon and email you.

803
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:18,643
Okay.

804
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:22,228
You have to return now?

805
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:27,078
Jun Woo, what is this place?
You should've asked.

806
00:52:28,274 --> 00:52:29,274
I'm sorry.

807
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,495
I've always been the one
making decisions in my life,

808
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:37,103
even for the smallest stuff.

809
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:40,518
At times, it's easier to have
someone else decide.

810
00:52:40,518 --> 00:52:42,152
But if you take away my choice...

811
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:44,232
and decide everything on your own,

812
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:45,664
it's really troubling.

813
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,033
Are you being angry now?

814
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:54,737
No, it's my fault for falling asleep.

815
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:58,178
If you're annoyed or mad, be like that.

816
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:01,326
Fighting is what makes relationships real.

817
00:53:01,326 --> 00:53:03,169
I don't mean it like that...

818
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:07,591
But why are we even here?

819
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:34,953
Right on time.

820
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:00,303
Today is the fireworks festival.

821
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,026
You get a great view from here.

822
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,100
Wait here.

823
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,390
Check this out.

824
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:45,315
That wasn't what I had planned to say.

825
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:47,540
What was it, then?

826
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,962
Forget it.

827
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:58,900
Sorry. You had all this prepared.

828
00:55:00,537 --> 00:55:04,355
I'm so clueless, right?

829
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:06,954
Let's get you home.

830
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:21,684
Yes, I work at Woori City Hall.

831
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:29,058
Who looks after your children?

832
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,329
That would be my ex-wife.

833
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,525
How many kids do you plan to have?

834
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:35,921
I don't want any.

835
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:38,011
Is that because you're old?

836
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:39,369
No.

837
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,259
I want to be a married couple
that can be like friends.

838
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:46,649
You make friends elsewhere.

839
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:48,861
I need a wife who keeps the house.

840
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:51,480
She won't worry about money,
and even quit work.

841
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,504
What would she do at home?

842
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:55,440
I have gatherings for business,

843
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,265
so she can prepare some food...

844
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:59,080
and just keep the house clean.

845
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,513
It seems you're looking for a maid.

846
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,206
I heard your academy went under.

847
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:10,317
You must have a lot of debt.

848
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:11,677
Just a little.

849
00:56:11,677 --> 00:56:15,643
But I can manage to pay it off
through my work.

850
00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:19,785
Your profile said you hate younger guys.

851
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:22,064
We're around my age,

852
00:56:22,064 --> 00:56:24,019
and you look decently young.

853
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,474
Ms. Koo Tae Yeon?

854
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,435
It's me, Su Hyeok.

855
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:35,139
Cha Su Hyeok?

856
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:37,226
Yes.

857
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:39,210
It's good to see you.

858
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,210
Indeed.

859
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,960
- Are you on a blind date?
- You, too?

860
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:46,527
- Yes.
- Then let's meet after.

861
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:47,606
Okay.

862
00:56:47,606 --> 00:56:50,201
She was my essay tutor in high school.

863
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,988
You're lucky because she was
our popular queen.

864
00:56:54,488 --> 00:56:55,488
Queen?

865
00:56:57,378 --> 00:56:58,799
I'm sorry.

866
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,488
I'll have to leave now.

867
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:04,219
Call me when you're done.

868
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:05,219
Good day.

869
00:57:06,395 --> 00:57:09,643
You, what do you take me for?

870
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:11,071
Are you crazy?

871
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:13,799
You're just a washed-up tutor
buried in debt,

872
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:15,602
so what's with that attitude?

873
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,062
What's this bastard?

874
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:19,175
What did you say?

875
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:20,239
Who in the world are you?

876
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:24,668
I'll stay calm because of my job.

877
00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:32,155
I couldn't care less about
all your luxuries,

878
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:33,276
so beat it.

879
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,314
So what happened?

880
00:57:39,314 --> 00:57:40,949
I felt so much better.

881
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:45,092
Girlfriend? This is my...

882
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:47,100
No.

883
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:49,985
Can't I introduce you as my girl?

884
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:51,721
What would they think?

885
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:54,092
Who cares about them? This is about us.

886
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:57,297
I'm sorry.

887
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,523
I'm so clueless, right?

888
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:04,339
Having to try isn't love.

889
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,713
What happened with your pupil?

890
00:58:08,713 --> 00:58:10,075
He gave me this energy drink.

891
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:13,001
Any chance with him?

892
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,724
It's not going to work.

893
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:19,067
I'm talking about me.

894
00:58:19,655 --> 00:58:21,513
With Jun Woo? Why?

895
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:26,912
I should stop trying.

896
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:28,191
- What?
- Trying?

897
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:31,607
It's just not going to work out.

898
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,500
What's the problem?

899
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,360
I can feel butterflies,
but it's not comfortable.

900
00:58:36,957 --> 00:58:39,500
I appreciate that he likes me,

901
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,145
but I don't like him with all my heart.

902
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,860
I just don't want to compromise
or give things up.

903
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:51,203
That means you're not in love.

904
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:56,029
But I really want to be.

905
00:58:56,029 --> 00:58:58,472
Are you going to tell Jun Woo?

906
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:02,054
I should, right?

907
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:04,518
Do you even hear yourself?

908
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,910
It's a struggle to love.

909
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:14,995
In my teens, I was obsessed with stars.

910
00:59:14,995 --> 00:59:17,230
And I fell in love with teachers.

911
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:22,818
In my 20s, I had a crush at school.

912
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:24,220
In my 30s,

913
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:29,781
I loved passionately and was heartbroken.

914
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:33,668
But why is it so hard in my 40s?

915
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:42,519
Kim Hyun Seok.

916
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:45,025
How could you be like this?

917
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,198
You liked me first.

918
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:49,977
You asked me out.

919
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,700
But what's that now?

920
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:54,736
- It won't work out?
- Ye Ji...

921
00:59:54,736 --> 00:59:56,825
Just say you like Hae Dam.

922
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:58,605
Why are you hiding that?

923
00:59:58,605 --> 00:59:59,893
That's even more spineless.

924
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:03,061
It's not like that.
I just want to be alone.

925
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:05,585
What? Do you want to be alone?

926
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:11,368
Ye Ji.

927
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:26,386
I should tell him.

928
01:00:27,703 --> 01:00:29,434
Even they have the guts.

929
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:33,817
I'll tell him.

930
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,939
What? Is something not working out?

931
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,117
I'm dying here.

932
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:52,698
Where are you going?

933
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:55,513
Today is the chefs' festival.

934
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:57,297
Lucky you.

935
01:00:57,297 --> 01:00:59,331
Your dream comes true on a date.

936
01:01:00,266 --> 01:01:01,266
Good grief.

937
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:04,961
Wait, we're supposed to wash
the windows today.

938
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,716
Let's do that tomorrow, okay?

939
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:16,581
Min Ju, do you remember our date?

940
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:17,849
I'll be waiting.

941
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:49,751
Yes, I have something to tell you.

942
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:50,881
See you later.

943
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,310
My word, my arm hurts.

944
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,445
Why are you trying to wash it alone?

945
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:09,653
Jun Woo always joined you.

946
01:02:09,653 --> 01:02:11,262
You can't even reach the top.

947
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:13,113
Jun Woo is busy dating.

948
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:16,743
I hate this.

949
01:02:16,743 --> 01:02:18,113
Sorry, I can't help you.

950
01:02:56,305 --> 01:03:00,214
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Min Ji Seon, age 29.

951
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,969
What happened to her?

952
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:09,075
It was an overdose of antidepressants.

953
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:11,215
- What?
- After her gastric lavage,

954
01:03:11,215 --> 01:03:13,874
we're waiting for more details
from her test result.

955
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,135
Min Ju, I'm sorry.

956
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,279
I won't make it today.

957
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,229
I'm really sorry. I'll call later.

958
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:41,395
Didn't you have plans with Jun Woo?

959
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:45,836
I got stood up today.

960
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:48,000
You got stood up?

961
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,421
It serves me right.

962
01:03:51,057 --> 01:03:52,057
Why are you saying that?

963
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:55,969
Love found me after a long time,

964
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,380
but I couldn't fall in love.

965
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,980
I might have failed.

966
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,373
So what?

967
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:11,460
So what if you fail?

968
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,531
You said those words make you feel better.

969
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:25,274
Just take your time.

970
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,075
Don't rush to think it's a failure.

971
01:04:42,562 --> 01:04:43,562
Jun Woo.

972
01:04:46,937 --> 01:04:49,694
Did you wait long?
I'm sorry for being late.

973
01:04:49,694 --> 01:04:51,155
No, I'm sorry.

974
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:16,787
