1
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:25,551
What is it?

2
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,415
Every day is too precious.

3
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:35,952
I can't waste another hour,
minute, or second.

4
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,000
That's because we nearly died.

5
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:43,860
Yes.

6
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:52,145
Is that what you wanted to say?

7
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:54,834
No.

8
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,146
I'm Ye Ji's dad, Sang Hee's brother,

9
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:08,317
Mi Rye's brother, and Jun Woo's brother.

10
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:14,854
But to you, I want to be just me.

11
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,946
While keeping true to myself,

12
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:24,490
I want to spend the rest of my days
with you.

13
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:32,692
Gang Min Ju.

14
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:39,210
Let's have a life together.

15
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:02,193
No.

16
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,051
Did you just say no?

17
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,216
Do you really not want to?

18
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:10,257
Ko Sang Sik.

19
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:13,203
You're a doting dad on Ye Ji,

20
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,261
a father-like brother to your sisters,

21
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:19,615
and a sworn brother to Jun Woo.

22
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,023
I like that about you.

23
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:29,400
So I can't be with only you.

24
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,562
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,682
(Second to Last Love)

26
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,586
(Final Episode)

27
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,038
Should we make another side dish?

28
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:17,921
This is more than enough of a spread.

29
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:19,681
Hold on a second.

30
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,138
Let's see here.

31
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,153
Okay.

32
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,897
I hope the seasoning is okay.

33
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:32,835
What are you making?

34
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:35,401
I'm making some salad with beef.

35
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:36,533
Just one moment.

36
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:38,445
That looks good.

37
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,804
Give it a taste.

38
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,809
It's so good.

39
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,351
I'll plate it as pretty as you are...

40
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:53,585
and treat you with delicious food.

41
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,737
The food smells great.

42
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,464
This looks good.

43
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,378
It's a great feast.

44
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:05,209
Why did you get so much ready?

45
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,264
Min Ju, if you cook this well,

46
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,112
where does that leave me?

47
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,024
You always have good food.

48
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:12,778
I gave it my best.

49
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,624
This isn't just a meal.

50
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:17,595
Is there some big news?

51
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:20,476
What are you saying?

52
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,433
Isn't there?

53
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,130
I helped out thinking there is.

54
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,434
Just say what you need.

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,855
Living next door,

56
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:32,054
I wanted to be like a family.

57
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,633
Are you marrying my uncle?

58
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,266
Marry?

59
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:39,425
Well, we're not there yet.

60
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,107
Just move in together.

61
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,475
Isn't this too much of a hassle?

62
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:48,020
As someone who experienced marriage,
I don’t recommend it.

63
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,118
Why not?

64
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:50,877
All right, let's get started.

65
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,342
- Dig in.
- Enjoy your meal.

66
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,249
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,730
It's so good.

68
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,503
What's wrong? Is it too salty?

69
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,978
- No.
- No.

70
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,472
It must be bland.

71
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,471
- I'll get some salt.
- Wait.

72
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,012
Eat.

73
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,273
Eat.

74
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:21,388
It's perfectly seasoned and delicious.

75
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,388
He's changed.

76
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,702
Jun Woo, it's better than your cooking.

77
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,350
It's the best taste, so eat it.

78
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,633
The seasoning is just right.

79
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,236
You worked hard today.

80
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:33,998
No big deal.

81
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,166
It was just preparing a meal.

82
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,390
With a big family like mine,

83
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,232
it's not easy whipping up a meal.

84
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:41,448
Too bad Ye Ji wasn't here.

85
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,964
Remember when I suggested...

86
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,932
that we start dining together
like a family?

87
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,535
You wanted to decide what comes next.

88
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,659
Right.

89
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,024
Is the idea of marriage too daunting?

90
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,260
It's not because of your family.

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Then?

92
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,611
Whether we decide to marry or not,

93
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:10,671
I believe life has more to offer
than a binary decision.

94
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:13,851
You're right.

95
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:17,631
Some couples cohabit without marrying,

96
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,941
while some can't live together
despite being married.

97
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:24,744
That includes long-distance fathers
and weekend couples.

98
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,191
Right.

99
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,671
So I have more to consider.

100
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,222
What kind of life could ensure
lasting happiness...

101
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,837
for both you and your family?

102
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,404
Rather than rushing into a marriage...

103
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,420
just because we want to be together,

104
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,292
I want to make a more thoughtful decision.

105
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,519
For everyone's sake.

106
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,568
That's very grown-up.

107
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:49,926
You're right.

108
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:54,263
I know that, but...

109
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,403
Why?

110
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,820
Is it difficult to wait?

111
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,912
It's tough. Each day feels like a year.

112
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,399
How do you want it to be?

113
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,940
Well, I'm not in the position to decide.

114
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,295
I'll have to wait.

115
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,779
Ye Ji told you to not feel bad like that.

116
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,570
Can I be honest with you?

117
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,570
Sure.

118
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:24,971
I want to hold your hand
and escape to a deserted island,

119
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,038
so we can live there on our own.

120
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,638
I fixed the draft affair.

121
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,394
Affair?

122
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,870
Goodness.

123
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,975
Is that coffee?

124
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:52,283
- Give me some.
- Pour it yourself.

125
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,691
Seriously.

126
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:57,362
Are you going to live this way?
Let's get back home.

127
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,296
- I'm not leaving.
- Just think about Hun.

128
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,103
If you cared about your child...

129
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,073
Forget it.

130
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,893
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,844
I mean it.

132
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,602
Pack up so we can go home.

133
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:14,763
The same thing will happen if we return.

134
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,163
I'll be the one who cooks and cleans...

135
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,715
while you look elsewhere for conversation.

136
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,266
No, I won't do that again.

137
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,799
How could you bear the frustration?

138
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,416
I'll just have to endure it.

139
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,767
Why should you endure it?

140
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,135
Life is too short to live unhappily.

141
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,295
Then what?

142
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,286
We should put in the effort
since we're married.

143
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,262
- We can live separately.
- What?

144
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,511
If your husband is going to such lengths,

145
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,632
you should give in and return home.

146
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:40,734
Why should I?

147
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,295
Why should I give up while you endure?

148
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:44,381
What's the point?

149
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,771
That's worse than divorce.

150
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,494
I also deserve to be happy.

151
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,479
So what?

152
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,315
I want to live my own life.

153
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,197
You can manage on your own.

154
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,449
For crying out loud.

155
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,192
Why should people live that way?

156
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,352
It's about respecting each other's lives.

157
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:07,232
Having personal space is very important,

158
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:08,664
especially as you grow older.

159
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:12,352
Are you saying that married people
could live separately?

160
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,517
That's the idea.

161
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,555
But wouldn't you want to be together...

162
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,890
if you love that person?

163
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,370
Well, naturally.

164
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,793
But love and making a life together...

165
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,176
are two different things.

166
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:27,655
Why? How do you want it to be?

167
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,493
I want to have kids after marrying,

168
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:33,580
snuggle up with my husband on the bed,

169
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,574
and watch TV with him all day.

170
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:39,427
Well, I'm not sure about that.

171
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,747
Why not? That's married life.

172
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,131
That's just your wishful thinking.

173
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,794
Reality isn't always like that.

174
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,700
How would you know about being single?

175
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,237
Then should we try it?

176
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,305
I'm not that easy.

177
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,676
Who's saying otherwise?

178
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,231
I didn't hear you clearly,
so make it proper.

179
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,589
Where are you going?

180
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,184
You're supposed to bring a ring.

181
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,603
I think we should have two beds...

182
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,068
and place them slightly apart.

183
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,493
What? Why?

184
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,909
That would be more comfortable.

185
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,973
I disagree with that. What else?

186
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:34,573
For breakfast, let's have fruit or soup,

187
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,027
so it's not too heavy.

188
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,872
But rice makes for a hearty breakfast.

189
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
What else?

190
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,177
We should watch TV separately.

191
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,017
Goodness, seriously.

192
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,135
We might like different things.

193
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,198
Why should we fight over the remote?

194
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,174
But I want to rest on your lap
while watching TV.

195
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:56,957
You can do that for the news
and sporting events.

196
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,338
And let's watch my dramas together.

197
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:00,492
Anything else?

198
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:04,873
When listening to music in the car,

199
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,737
let's take turns to choose.

200
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:09,347
Are you saying our tastes are different?

201
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:13,544
No, but we might feel different
depending on the day.

202
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:15,250
My goodness.

203
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:16,948
Is there more?

204
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:21,864
That's about it for now.

205
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:25,312
I'd like that if we were to live together.

206
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:29,185
Goodness, you're too independent.

207
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,030
Tell me if you have more.

208
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,393
I'll try my best.

209
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,569
How do I live with someone I love?

210
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,245
As I grow older,

211
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:48,524
living with another person isn't easy.

212
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,111
As a grown adult,

213
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:56,096
it's not easy changing my ways.

214
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,841
Even so, I want to be with my love...

215
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,311
and be happy together.

216
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,891
My word.

217
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:21,206
Were you waiting to leave with me?

218
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,935
Of course, what's your choice?

219
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,239
But, subway, or bicycle.

220
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,579
Well...

221
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:33,271
Let's hike a mountain this weekend.

222
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:34,461
- Hike a mountain?
- Yes.

223
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,324
The leaves are starting to color.

224
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,429
Sure.

225
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,157
How about hiking every weekend?

226
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:42,661
Sure.

227
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,231
And every once a week,

228
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,025
how about we meet up for lunch?

229
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,775
- No.
- Why?

230
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,293
Make it twice a week.

231
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:52,795
All right.

232
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:56,919
And let's take the family out
once or twice a month.

233
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,919
Sure.

234
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,837
And if we have to work late,
let's call beforehand.

235
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:02,516
Sure.

236
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,691
How about we pick out together
what we need at home?

237
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:07,566
- No.
- Why?

238
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,083
Then I can't give surprise gifts.

239
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,119
You have a point.

240
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,097
How about some music?

241
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,571
Sure.

242
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:26,740
How do you like my taste?

243
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,839
I love it.

244
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:37,198
Good morning.

245
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,379
What's going on?

246
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,941
Your demotion was overturned
and cleared of everything.

247
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,753
Thanks.

248
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:49,976
All right, everyone.

249
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,586
Hello.

250
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,313
I've got even better news for you.

251
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,968
- What?
- Chief Ko.

252
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,164
You have won this year's Righteous Award.

253
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,665
Boss, did you know a hearing...

254
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,759
is currently in session with Producer Han?

255
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,285
No. What do you think will happen?

256
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,590
Beats me.

257
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,260
Producer Han.

258
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,188
I've been reassigned to a rural region.

259
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:27,320
You get to work.

260
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,763
That's too bad.

261
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:39,607
What? He had it coming.

262
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:42,192
I used to work for him as an assistant.

263
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,554
Goodness me, you're too forgiving.

264
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,519
Wait a minute.

265
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:48,983
Yes, Producer Nam.

266
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,112
What? The actors are fighting?

267
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:54,903
I can't do this anymore.

268
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,777
- Then don't do it.
- What?

269
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,174
Manager, he said we could go.

270
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:00,596
Let's head out. Get the car.

271
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:01,781
What's going on here?

272
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,480
Boss, you're here.

273
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,052
He knew we had many shoots today,

274
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,595
but didn't show up prepared.

275
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:10,116
There was a reason for that.

276
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,611
Wait, what reason?

277
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,236
How can you say that as a star
and a professional actor?

278
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:15,885
Please don't be like this.

279
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,804
You were doing great before.

280
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,619
What happened yesterday?

281
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,785
It's private, so I can't talk about it.

282
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:26,407
You shouldn't let it affect your work.

283
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,559
It's because he's crazy about a girl.

284
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,087
What are you saying, seriously!

285
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,376
Is that true?

286
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,376
Goodness.

287
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:35,189
Don't mix love with business. What is it?

288
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,821
Who? Is she an actress?

289
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,725
No, it's not like that.

290
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,769
- Producer Nam.
- What is it?

291
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:43,515
What?

292
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:44,764
Look at this.

293
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,164
Who is this person?

294
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,472
Min Ji Seon?

295
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,426
So, they're featuring your cafe...

296
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,499
in the Woori City travel guide?

297
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,642
Yes.

298
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,210
That will draw a big crowd.

299
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,036
Why? Aren't you pleased?

300
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:08,730
That's great news.

301
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,738
I'm just worried about the girls.

302
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,092
Goodness, you don't have to worry.

303
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:18,108
With a buzz about Mr. Wook,
Ji Seon is riding high.

304
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,764
That's good to know.

305
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,763
Should we start rumors about us?

306
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,263
Seriously.

307
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:29,713
- You worked hard.
- Great work.

308
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,782
- Thank you.
- Take care.

309
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,092
Thanks.

310
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:36,789
Don't mention it.

311
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,234
I'm honored to promote your cafe.

312
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,383
Are you dating Mr. Wook?

313
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,167
No, we're just friends.

314
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,413
Mr. Wook must be crushing on her.

315
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:49,646
I need more time to figure him out.

316
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:51,991
You should be cautious.

317
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,478
I know.

318
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,638
I'm confident I won't get hurt.

319
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,555
Anyway, congratulations.

320
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,147
Thank you.

321
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,580
But why aren't you getting married?

322
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:04,813
- Get married?
- Look, Min Ji Seon.

323
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:07,932
It's okay to take things slow,

324
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,549
but if you two are serious,

325
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,734
tell your family and pick a date.

326
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:12,873
Tell my family?

327
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,209
You should get going.

328
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,565
I don't want reporters swarming
about your dating scandal.

329
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:18,970
Hurry, just go.

330
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,409
Okay.

331
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,480
Mi Rye, hang in there.

332
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,671
Right. Bye.

333
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,232
Hurry, get moving.

334
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:30,833
Should I tell my family?

335
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:33,554
What do I say?

336
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,726
This gives me a headache.

337
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:38,910
What's the problem?

338
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,273
You. You give me a headache.

339
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,306
Let's go.

340
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:49,852
What are you saying?

341
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,823
I'm not sure marriage is the right step.

342
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:58,213
What made you think that?

343
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:00,544
Being legally bound as a couple...

344
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,252
means we'll be there for each other,

345
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:09,229
which offers security and comfort.

346
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,318
But?

347
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:15,224
Taking a mother role is another story.

348
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,028
Are you overwhelmed by Ye Ji?

349
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,826
There was that time.

350
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:21,010
She said not to act like her mother.

351
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,108
That's not why.

352
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:26,009
Honestly, I can see myself bonding...

353
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,402
and becoming friends with her.

354
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:31,425
But even if she is a nice kid...

355
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,945
who is mature for her age and exceptional,

356
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:37,457
having a stepmom in her life...

357
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:40,997
would bring an enormous change.

358
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:45,458
Well, that's true.

359
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,201
But she's all grown up.

360
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,464
Ye Ji could just be an excuse.

361
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,867
What? Then what?

362
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,013
It's about whether I'm committed.

363
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,474
Are you not ready to live with me...

364
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,760
or are you unsure about it?

365
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,834
No.

366
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,143
I thought of various ways to do this.

367
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:17,080
For a month, we can live separately.

368
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,288
Then you move in with me for another.

369
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:24,935
After that, I can try out your place...

370
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,193
and live with the family.

371
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:30,273
How about we try this cycle?

372
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:33,724
It could help us figure it out.

373
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,147
To see if marriage is what we need.

374
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,452
Let's think about that.

375
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,949
Is this better or this?

376
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:51,771
They look both nice and similar.

377
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,747
Come on, take a good look.

378
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,218
It must be nice to get married.

379
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,813
What? Doesn't she want to?

380
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:06,304
She wants to consider whether
it's what we truly need.

381
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,702
What about you?

382
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:12,823
I want to take her around
always in my pocket.

383
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,901
Right?

384
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,440
I feel the same way.

385
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:24,021
Your family is a problem.

386
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,212
So many.

387
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:26,444
You have a large family.

388
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:27,444
No.

389
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:30,663
She would care for my family
better than I do.

390
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,919
Then you're the problem.

391
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,071
What?

392
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,282
Did you propose to her?

393
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:37,856
Propose?

394
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,926
I can't believe you.

395
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:43,175
You should move her heart.

396
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:47,223
There is a defining moment
that seals a marriage.

397
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:50,071
Ironic for a life-changing choice.

398
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:53,604
When a woman sees a man,

399
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,835
she decides whether to end things...

400
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,444
or to spend a lifetime with him.

401
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:00,715
That decision comes in an instant...

402
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:04,796
because of what pulls at the heartstrings.

403
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,292
That can't be with everyone.

404
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:10,494
Despite a hundred things to like,

405
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:12,767
if there is one deal breaker,

406
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,418
she wouldn't stay with the guy.

407
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,358
Are you sure?

408
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,831
But then again,

409
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:22,130
even with all her doubts about the guy,

410
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,963
one thing could be a game-changer.

411
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:28,979
And despite trying to fight it,

412
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:32,450
she'll be walking down the aisle.
That's women for you.

413
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,179
So, I should strike the right chord
with her?

414
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,996
- Right.
- Propose like that?

415
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,685
That's what I mean.

416
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,095
How did you propose to her?

417
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,083
- Me?
- Yes.

418
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,187
I didn't, I just asked her
to live with me.

419
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,560
Then how?

420
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,823
Even after promising to marry,

421
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:56,152
women often change their minds
and go back and forth.

422
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:59,736
So when they are anxious, you strike.

423
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:01,976
You propose right then.

424
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,219
That's when.

425
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,697
Come on.

426
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:11,296
Let go. I'll think about it.

427
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,089
What's there to think about
with a fixed date?

428
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:17,922
I can't decide on our wedding impulsively.

429
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:21,648
Goodness, I can't keep up with your whims.

430
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,496
I got everything ready, so try it on.

431
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:25,788
- You're unbelievable.
- Come on.

432
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,785
Aren't you ready yet?

433
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,051
I'll be ready in a moment.

434
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,587
But you keep saying that.

435
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,171
I could've married twice by now.

436
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,532
What did you say?

437
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:45,428
I can hear everything.

438
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:47,751
You can? Goodness.

439
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:49,226
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:01,953
What do you think?

441
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,676
You're not a human being.

442
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,490
What?

443
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:14,284
It's like you descended from Heaven.

444
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,739
Stop embarrassing me.

445
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,983
Are you embarrassed?

446
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,643
Then I'll take it up a notch.

447
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,787
Let's spin.

448
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,770
I'm dizzy.

449
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:35,016
You're making me dizzy.

450
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,149
Come this way.

451
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,773
Where are you going?

452
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,029
Take a seat.

453
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,869
This woman is mine.

454
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:56,483
We'll have a sweet lifetime together.

455
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,126
So, please congratulate us.

456
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:07,960
Now, put aside your whims,

457
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:12,160
and let's share a bed together.

458
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,353
All right.

459
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:21,280
Even if we might regret it, let's do this.

460
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:29,343
What are you doing this?

461
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,589
What are you doing?

462
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,507
- Chief Ko.
- Yes?

463
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:43,015
What's all this?

464
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,537
Pick one.

465
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,119
I've spent the last few days making...

466
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,882
wedding invitation samples.

467
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:52,844
Really?

468
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:54,882
Chief Ko, are you getting married?

469
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:56,554
It's more than expected.

470
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:59,658
Ms. Han, you have some serious talent.

471
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,834
Are you finally giving him up?

472
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,161
This isn't giving up.

473
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,453
I'm wishing for his happiness.

474
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:10,404
My feelings remain unchanged.

475
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,807
You should pick one.

476
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,337
Yes, okay.

477
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,937
This one. Thanks.

478
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,288
Okay, good day.

479
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:22,852
- Bye.
- Take care.

480
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,208
- You can take the rest.
- I'm good.

481
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,972
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:29,537
How pretty.

483
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:30,696
I'll take this as well.

484
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:35,496
This is kind of sad.

485
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:52,552
My goodness, it's breathtaking.

486
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,042
- You like it that much?
- Yes.

487
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,515
Let's take one together.

488
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,515
Shall we?

489
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,939
Okay, one, two, three.

490
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,291
After being stuck in my room,

491
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,725
it's refreshing to be out like this.

492
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,236
I can't breathe.

493
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:17,236
What?

494
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:23,203
It's our first time coming here.

495
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:24,596
Right.

496
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:26,757
You wanted to make new memories.

497
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,121
Yes, I love it.

498
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:34,474
Are you going to that school in Canada?

499
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:38,088
Well, what do you think?

500
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:42,387
Offers like that don't come every day.

501
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:44,651
It could change your life around.

502
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,070
Just go if you want.

503
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:48,623
It does seem that way.

504
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,734
But five years is too long.

505
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:55,445
Look, Ko Mi Rye.

506
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:58,513
Why can't you be honest?

507
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:00,154
Tell me to stay.

508
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,736
Say you don't want me to leave you.

509
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:05,292
Will you not go, if I ask that?

510
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,099
I won't.

511
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:14,857
I'm perfectly happy here.

512
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:17,932
So why would I want to be away
from you and the family?

513
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:23,072
It's not about fulfilling dreams...

514
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:26,349
but finding happiness in the moment.

515
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:28,133
Are you serious?

516
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:30,475
Yes.

517
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,556
Really? You're not going?

518
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:36,716
Yes.

519
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:45,333
That's good thinking.

520
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:48,898
Thank you.

521
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,175
Here. Let's go.

522
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:54,374
What about you? You're not eating?

523
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,402
Are you going to finish that?

524
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:58,660
Yes, it's barely enough for me.

525
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,915
Seriously.

526
00:28:01,627 --> 00:28:04,124
Wait, that's the bunny ear.

527
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,806
What? This is good.

528
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:14,911
Come on, I haven't had one bite.

529
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:15,911
Wait.

530
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:22,312
- Just one bite.
- Okay.

531
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:23,688
- All right?
- Okay.

532
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:25,187
- Promise me.
- Okay.

533
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,417
Wait!

534
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:41,505
What do you need to tell me?

535
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,119
I need to share what happened.

536
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:51,160
The fire that took Eun Ho started...

537
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,867
because someone stubbornly went ahead
with the shoot,

538
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:57,267
and it wasn't Ko Sang Sik, but me.

539
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,409
Why are you telling me this?

540
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:04,062
I know you won't be leaving him now.

541
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:07,308
So, are you clearing your conscience?

542
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:11,243
I wanted it off my chest before leaving.

543
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:12,366
Do you feel better now?

544
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,788
It's much lighter.

545
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,594
Producer Han.

546
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:22,825
You can be better than this.

547
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,478
So what if you take longer than others?

548
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:30,274
You didn't start this work
for the spotlight.

549
00:29:30,274 --> 00:29:33,185
Like you, I wanted to be a star director.

550
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,596
It'd be nice to be noticed for a change.

551
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,564
What did you tell me?

552
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:39,735
You said that stardom...

553
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,055
is like sugar that doesn't last.

554
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,542
I did.

555
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:49,360
Like you said, loving what you do...

556
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,737
could bring longer and greater joy.

557
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:56,364
And I'm trying to live that way.

558
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,770
Thanks.

559
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,356
I'll give it a shot.

560
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:10,907
Ms. Gang.

561
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,857
Ye Ji, what brings you here?

562
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,934
I had a rehearsal on stage today.

563
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,133
There is a contest tomorrow.

564
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:21,126
The one where they pick a new member?

565
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:26,542
Could you bring my dad tomorrow?

566
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:29,257
Of course.

567
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,903
Does he know about it?

568
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:32,519
No.

569
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,327
You can tell him for me.

570
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:38,183
He doesn't like attending these events.

571
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,655
Okay, I'll talk him around.

572
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:43,223
All right, I'll get back now.

573
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:44,250
Okay.

574
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:52,628
I've been here alone before.

575
00:30:53,578 --> 00:30:56,354
I took a walk during the filming shoot,

576
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,073
and it was really nice.

577
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:01,025
I was alone and stressed at the time,

578
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,414
but I'm back with you.

579
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:08,370
By the way, Ye Ji's final audition
will be held at the network tomorrow.

580
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,442
Is it already tomorrow?

581
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,515
Let's go together.

582
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,681
No, why would I go there?

583
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,543
Because you're her dad.

584
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:18,584
I don't want to be an obsessive parent...

585
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,486
desperate to see their child shine.

586
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:23,370
But she asked me to bring you.

587
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,722
Why didn't she tell me directly?

588
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:26,464
She seems to go to you first.

589
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,005
Am I causing this distance...

590
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,470
between you and your daughter?

591
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,802
No way.

592
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,615
You're like our bridge instead.

593
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:36,928
The bridge that connects us.

594
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:42,105
We saw fireflies here.

595
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,701
It looks different in the daylight.

596
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,133
You see, there is something.

597
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:56,046
I wanted to show you this.

598
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,046
What is it?

599
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,590
Just a moment.

600
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:02,008
One, two, three.

601
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:08,722
You were born to be loved

602
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:11,117
Producer Gang, please take care of him.

603
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,281
I hope your romance with Chief Ko...

604
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,616
is forever sweet.

605
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,834
I'm jealous.

606
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,380
I hope you adore Chief Ko.

607
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:31,442
You are truly a perfect couple.

608
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:32,442
Bang.

609
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:38,014
Producer Gang, it's me.

610
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:40,866
As you well know,

611
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:44,939
Chief Ko is such a great person.

612
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,302
I hope you shower him with love.

613
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:52,459
Love him to the moon and back.

614
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:58,602
I truly wish you happiness.

615
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:02,845
One, two, three.

616
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:04,912
We wish you happiness!

617
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:06,997
One more time.

618
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,665
Happiness!

619
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,346
Good heavens.

620
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,320
I'm touched.

621
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,912
I didn't expect your employees
to send their congratulations.

622
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,001
Has it changed your mind in any way?

623
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,900
Isn't that a wedding invitation?

624
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,463
Yes, Ms. Han made it for me.

625
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,383
Did you get rejected again?

626
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:45,100
No, I turned him down.

627
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,660
Good for you.

628
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,479
And don't go on blind dates.

629
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,951
Not anymore.

630
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:53,454
- Why not?
- Those guys can't be trusted.

631
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:55,883
If you end up falling for a loser...

632
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,525
and marrying such a guy,

633
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:59,664
you will be miserable.

634
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,648
Then I would leave him.

635
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,057
Aren't you giving me an answer?

636
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:10,415
Whether it has changed my mind?

637
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,147
Just live alone.

638
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:16,310
Why do you even need to marry?

639
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,454
It's not your life.

640
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:19,761
Mr. Cha?

641
00:34:22,638 --> 00:34:23,686
Chief Ko.

642
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,726
- Hello.
- Hello.

643
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:30,109
Min Ju.

644
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:32,770
You two...

645
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,884
They must be dating.

646
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,568
This is my teacher.

647
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,555
The student I talked to you about.

648
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:41,942
Goodness.

649
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:42,947
Teacher?

650
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,519
I didn't see that coming.

651
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,439
Who knew her student was your employee?

652
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,704
It's a small world.

653
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:58,250
That's why you should never
do something bad.

654
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:02,607
Tae Yeon ruled out younger guys.

655
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:04,056
But don't they look great?

656
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,855
Not at all.

657
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:06,879
Why not?

658
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,843
They don't have our chemistry.

659
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,073
You mistook it for "mystery" last time.

660
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:13,136
I knew what it meant.

661
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,728
Don't you know dad jokes?

662
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,630
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

663
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:20,428
Look, why did the scarecrow get promoted?

664
00:35:20,428 --> 00:35:21,624
What do you think?

665
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:24,149
What is it?

666
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,231
He was outstanding in his field.

667
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,283
- Outstanding in his field?
- Yes.

668
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:32,831
Why did the pig leave the party early?

669
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,270
Because everyone thought it was a bore.
I know that one.

670
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,439
Do you know the hungry clock joke?

671
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,575
Yes.

672
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,032
What happened to the hungry clock?

673
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:40,742
It went back four seconds.

674
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:41,962
That's right.

675
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:47,168
You know Ye Ji's audition is tomorrow?

676
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:48,526
Of course.

677
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,046
You can't be late.

678
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,122
Okay.

679
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:03,523

00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:10,960
What's taking him?

681
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:17,968
That was great.

682
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:23,385
Next up, Ko Ye Ji will be performing.

683
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:24,915
Welcome her with applause.

684
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,936
Break a leg.

685
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,936
You can do it.

686
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:35,585
I'm right on time.

687
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:37,095
Why are you late?

688
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,762
Something came up at the last minute.

689
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:40,189
You came. Thanks.

690
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,909
(Star Like the Milky Way
Ko Ye Ji)

691
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:04,600
She's good.

692
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:17,028
Great job. That was Ko Ye Ji.

693
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,049
Now they're going to interview you.

694
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:22,438
Interview me?

695
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,283
That was great.

696
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,880
Is Ko Ye Ji's parent here?

697
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,645
Yes, that would be me.

698
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,884
Ye Ji performed adorably with passion.

699
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:37,731
I wonder if you also take an interest
in this field.

700
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:41,366
What is the song she danced to called?

701
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,086
You can't have others tell you the answer.

702
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,429
Right, I see.

703
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:53,829
Well, I'm not sure.

704
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:57,973
Yes, all right.

705
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,236
Wait a minute.

706
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:08,666
Since you mentioned passion,

707
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:12,066
I'm passionate about what
my daughter loves.

708
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:13,997
How will you show that?

709
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,010
All right.

710
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:20,218
I know the idols she likes.

711
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:26,549
Taeyang, Seungri, T.O.P,
Dae Sung, G-DRAGON.

712
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:27,549
They are members of BigBang.

713
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:32,250
ZICO, Taeil, Jaehyo, B-Bomb, P.O,

714
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,549
Park Kyung, and U-KWON are in Block B.

715
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,283
EXO has many members, so I'm not sure.

716
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:40,609
SUHO, CHANYEOL, KAI, D.O.,

717
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,127
BAEKHYUN, SEHUN, XIUMIN, LAY, CHEN.

718
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,250
That's all of them.

719
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:46,979
There three other members left the group.

720
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:52,240
Yes, that's great.

721
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,073
You have proven your point.

722
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,326
How did you memorize all that?

723
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,662
It's a given.

724
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,470
- Don't you know them?
- Goodness.

725
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:12,146
Who cares if you didn't win?
You did great.

726
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,522
Isn't that right?

727
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:16,338
Yes, but you were a shocker today.

728
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:17,458
Don't you agree?

729
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,573
I didn't see that coming.

730
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:21,667
You even know better than me.

731
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,656
I've studied whenever I could.

732
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:26,207
I'm sorry you came all this way...

733
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:28,031
only to see me lose.

734
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,769
No, I had a great time.

735
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,760
And you gained experience from it.

736
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,521
Indeed. Striving hard for the goal...

737
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:36,989
is a valuable experience.

738
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:41,050
Dad, I heard you're getting
an award tomorrow.

739
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,086
Award?

740
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:43,895
What award?

741
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,912
(The 3rd Righteous Civil Servant Award)

742
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,818
This award from the citizens...

743
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,626
makes me feel proud and honored for you.

744
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,178
Congratulations.

745
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:05,681
I'm glad since you made it possible.

746
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,427
I'm happy to be of service.

747
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:10,918
I only did what was necessary,

748
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,934
so this award is kind of humbling.

749
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:16,106
It suggests there are too many
people in our society...

750
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:18,642
who aren't doing the right thing.

751
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:20,256
That's true.

752
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,651
So, make it democratic and rational?

753
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:24,772
Is that how it works?

754
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:28,252
Anyway, I'm glad it ended nicely for you.

755
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,626
How are things on your end?

756
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:32,918
With my drama?

757
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:33,943
Yes.

758
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:36,422
To see if all is going well
after everything,

759
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:37,911
I'll swing by your workplace.

760
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,950
There is also that wedding to attend.

761
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:44,477
Yes, with the Deputy Mayor.

762
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,489
With so much to celebrate these days,

763
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,057
I couldn't be happier.

764
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:50,988
There is a greater celebration.

765
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,662
- What?
- It's a secret.

766
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:56,362
But I might tell you later.

767
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:57,541
What?

768
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,019
What brings you here?

769
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,537
You reached out after dodging my calls.

770
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:24,779
I wanted to clear the air with you.

771
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:25,852
Clear the air?

772
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:30,005
Okay, let's hear it.

773
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:34,561
The closest to you are what matters.

774
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,325
I came to remind you of that.

775
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:39,089
The closest to me?

776
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,123
That's what led to my divorce.

777
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,650
My ex-husband wanted me close
before we got hitched.

778
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,235
But after, he took me for granted...

779
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:49,226
and didn't care to look my way.

780
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:52,171
And he got agitated when I wasn't around.

781
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:54,685
Like a child with a lollipop.

782
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,284
He was a man-child.

783
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,574
That's shameful.

784
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:05,226
It's not that I don't love my wife.

785
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:09,159
Divorcing her isn't even on my mind.

786
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,634
But after drifting through life aimlessly,

787
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,075
I fear that I might lose myself.

788
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,467
Sometimes, it's not bad getting lost.

789
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:23,182
The journey back is necessary
and even fulfilling.

790
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:25,779
Maybe I should.

791
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:28,650
Chances are, you have kept yourself...

792
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,020
because your wife has stuck around.

793
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,492
I appreciate you telling me this.

794
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:36,888
So, you're going to put in the work?

795
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,953
Sounds like a plan.

796
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:42,658
What made you come and tell me?

797
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:45,392
You struck me as a good person.

798
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:47,467
So I felt the need to say it.

799
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:57,125
I never expected a perfect family.

800
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,136
Mothers can't always smile...

801
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:02,327
while the kids appreciate their food...

802
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,031
after every meal.

803
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:07,487
And husbands can't bring home
flowers each day.

804
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:10,598
No family is like that.

805
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:14,390
I just told myself not to compare.

806
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,890
And even if I'm lazy and
can't keep a perfect house,

807
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,126
I believed my husband would stick by me...

808
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,502
because he always had my back.

809
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:27,511
I figured it was okay to show my flaws.

810
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:29,040
That's what I thought.

811
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:36,481
I'm not sure since I've never married.

812
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:44,298
But don't wives need their own space?

813
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,566
Why would I need one?

814
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:49,506
I have the whole house to myself.

815
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,306
Not in that way.

816
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:55,712
Husbands say they need a man cave.

817
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,201
But I think you really need that.

818
00:44:02,277 --> 00:44:06,022
You can always consider divorce later.

819
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:08,129
So, in your own space,

820
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:10,187
you should spend time alone.

821
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:12,805
I think that could be a nice change.

822
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:15,946
My own space?

823
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:19,050
It won't be about your husband or son,

824
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,477
but completely about you.

825
00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:25,771
Since I'm at work during the day,

826
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:30,078
you should come here to enjoy that.

827
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:34,150
Well. Min Ju.

828
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,556
So you're going to use her place?

829
00:44:38,556 --> 00:44:41,863
Yes, just for a couple of days.

830
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:43,942
I see.

831
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:49,475
It looks like we're becoming a family.

832
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:50,475
What?

833
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:52,399
It's nothing.

834
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,625
About that loan you got.

835
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,631
Yes?

836
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:00,631
After considering everything,

837
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,543
you probably face a two-year probation.

838
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:05,206
So you stay out of trouble, got it?

839
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:06,742
Of course.

840
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:10,896
I'll always be careful, so don't worry.

841
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:11,896
I promise.

842
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:14,536
Goodness.

843
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:18,937
You know, tomorrow is very important.

844
00:45:19,906 --> 00:45:20,952
Important?

845
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,160
Look at this.

846
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:28,942
This is the lease contract.

847
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:30,505
I mean, look over here.

848
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:37,601
Right.

849
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,644
You're helpful this time.

850
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,018
Only this once?

851
00:45:44,018 --> 00:45:46,447
Yes, just once.

852
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,895
Thanks for letting me know.

853
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:07,879
My word.

854
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,021
I had to leave early.

855
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:18,480
Sorry about missing breakfast.

856
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:30,142
It's seaweed soup.

857
00:46:32,218 --> 00:46:34,422
- Come on.
- Let go, you punk.

858
00:46:39,078 --> 00:46:40,117
Cut!

859
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:42,359
Okay, you worked hard.

860
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:46,306
We have all the scenes down
with the preview left.

861
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:47,434
Producer Nam, well done.

862
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:49,003
But this is only the beginning.

863
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,026
Of course.

864
00:46:50,026 --> 00:46:51,962
This is really touching.

865
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:55,142
I can't hide this excitement.

866
00:46:56,058 --> 00:46:57,731
Actors, you all did a great job.

867
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,277
What a great slap.

868
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,890
It's the same for me.

869
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,715
I know that I've upset you a lot.

870
00:47:08,715 --> 00:47:11,506
Thanks for doing so well.

871
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:12,859
Don't worry about it.

872
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:15,257
It's the beginning for me as well.

873
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:17,729
You can treat me like before.

874
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:19,947
I'm used to it now.

875
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:22,297
No, I don't need to anymore.

876
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,906
Keep up the good work, okay?

877
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:26,141
Thank you.

878
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,205
Me, too.

879
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:33,921
Yes, Mi Rye.

880
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:38,111
Remember what I said at the stables?

881
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,984
There is someone who cares...

882
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,633
always by my side.

883
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:45,847
Yes.

884
00:47:45,847 --> 00:47:47,185
Thank you.

885
00:47:54,647 --> 00:47:55,764
- Come here.
- Okay.

886
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,116
You're such a great partner.

887
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:06,183
I couldn't have made it here without you.

888
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:12,277
What are you saying?

889
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:14,104
Just know that...

890
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,954
knowing you was like striking gold.

891
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,493
Please come by after work.

892
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,212
Are you home?

893
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:56,220
Isn't anyone here?

894
00:49:01,883 --> 00:49:05,299
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

895
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:08,557
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

896
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:12,461
- Happy birthday, Dear Min Ju
- Happy birthday, Dear Min Ju

897
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:15,689
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

898
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:19,236
Happy birthday.

899
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:22,267
My goodness, this is a surprise.

900
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:23,788
Thank you.

901
00:49:23,788 --> 00:49:25,183
Blow out the candles.

902
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,476
Why are there so many?

903
00:49:29,476 --> 00:49:30,476
Goodness.

904
00:49:30,476 --> 00:49:33,785
Each candle marks the years of your life,

905
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:36,554
and it's proof that you have worked hard.

906
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:39,470
Mashing ten years into one is unthinkable.

907
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:43,472
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

908
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:47,662
Blow it out.

909
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:56,917
Thanks so much.

910
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:59,605
How did you know it's my birthday?

911
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:02,461
That's a given living next door.

912
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,566
Of course.

913
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:04,701
- Is that how it works?
- Yes.

914
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,779
Then let me know your birthdays.

915
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:07,867
- June 18th.
- January 15th.

916
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:09,339
July 2nd.

917
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,833
- Okay.
- Tell her yours.

918
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:13,992
Did you like the seaweed soup?

919
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:16,746
You had it prepared on purpose?

920
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,869
Of course.

921
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,568
What was your birthday wish?

922
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,605
It took me too long to meet
such great people.

923
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:30,130
Too bad it wasn't sooner.

924
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,597
So I wished for a lifetime
of joy with your family.

925
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:39,509
We're just starting out in life.

926
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:44,213
You don't need to get anxious
or regretful about it.

927
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:46,714
Have you ever heard of the life clock?

928
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:47,745
Life clock?

929
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,283
If you break down life into 24 hours,

930
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:52,364
you'd know where you're at.

931
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:54,738
Since people live to be around 100,

932
00:50:54,738 --> 00:50:58,090
being 50 would place you around noon.

933
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,312
For us, it's only eleven.

934
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:04,048
So, not even half a day is gone?

935
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:05,982
Yes, it's still morning.

936
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:07,810
So we can do anything we want.

937
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,354
That makes me feel easy and happy.

938
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:21,899
I should give you my present.

939
00:51:23,128 --> 00:51:24,376
You got me a present?

940
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,376
Of course.

941
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:28,212
How should I do this?

942
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,145
Ta-da.

943
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,708
Look here.

944
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,820
Even if you might not love it,

945
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,232
I hope you cherish my first present.

946
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:41,485
Nope.

947
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:42,584
You have it wrong.

948
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:44,205
What's that?

949
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:48,198
Remember this? It was your first gift.

950
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:51,942
You know, right here.

951
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,105
What's this?

952
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,911
Your hairpin broke.

953
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,566
Right.

954
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:01,714
- My goodness.
- Right!

955
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:03,886
This is my second present.

956
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:10,371
How pretty.

957
00:52:13,545 --> 00:52:15,266
Lovely. What do you think?

958
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:17,464
Wait.

959
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:21,764
This would be hanging here.

960
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:24,944
How does it go?

961
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:30,058
You're pretty.

962
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:31,733
You're so pretty.

963
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:47,022
It's in human nature to seek refuge.

964
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:53,326
That can be either work, love, or family.

965
00:52:54,698 --> 00:52:56,681
And all the while,

966
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:59,059
we hope to escape loneliness.

967
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:04,437
Growing old makes everyone anxious.

968
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:07,827
But in a 24-hour life,

969
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:10,404
it's barely even noon for us.

970
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:14,738
So there is still time for anything.

971
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:15,917
Anything we want.

972
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:55,171
Aren't you coming?

973
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:01,264
No.

974
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,618
Honey, you know,

975
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:11,149
I'm really sorry.

976
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:13,663
Hun's mom.

977
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:18,413
Sang Hee.

978
00:54:22,187 --> 00:54:25,356
I still remember the days...

979
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,886
when we prepared for our wedding.

980
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:31,500
We were hunting for a wedding dress,

981
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,186
but you kept complaining about them all.

982
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:38,076
So, I got frustrated and lost my temper.

983
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:41,804
That's when you said how it was crazy...

984
00:54:41,804 --> 00:54:44,422
to spend so much on a rental dress.

985
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,645
And you ended up customizing a gown...

986
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,231
and wore it to our wedding.

987
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,883
Seeing you down the aisle in that dress,

988
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:01,134
I wanted to make my wife,

989
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:04,224
the only woman in my life,

990
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,881
happy in all the years to come.

991
00:55:09,046 --> 00:55:11,128
Since then, I've worked so hard...

992
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:14,713
and have endured despite everything.

993
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:17,232
Sang Hee.

994
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:22,563
With you and Hun,

995
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,524
I want to be happy.

996
00:55:35,842 --> 00:55:37,205
Your button came off.

997
00:55:40,194 --> 00:55:41,694
It came off.

998
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:49,462
Let's go.

999
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:52,740
Let's try again.

1000
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:01,021
Thanks.

1001
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:16,597
I'm getting married again at this age.

1002
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,567
How do we look together?

1003
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,247
Aren't we beautiful?

1004
00:56:26,043 --> 00:56:28,143
- You look great.
- Beautiful.

1005
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:35,340
How will I live?

1006
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,124
What values will I have?

1007
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:41,197
Growing older, I still ask myself...

1008
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,993
these endless questions.

1009
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:46,088
For me, I'll be a bit lazy...

1010
00:56:46,088 --> 00:56:48,778
but happy in all my years.

1011
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:53,982
By cherishing her as my family,

1012
00:56:53,982 --> 00:56:55,316
I'll live that way.

1013
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:58,663
Marriage starts with love,
stays with affection,

1014
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:00,983
and endures with commitment.

1015
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:04,373
I won't forget my love for him.

1016
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:10,145
This love beside me now...

1017
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:12,642
will be my life partner.

1018
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:15,321
And sharing all the joys and sorrows,

1019
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:19,479
we'll make happiness ours...

1020
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:23,051
for the rest of our lives.

1021
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:42,900
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1022
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Congratulations.

1023
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:48,095
Maybe we should've had a joint wedding.

1024
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:52,619
Everyone has their way of living.

1025
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,834
Whatever path you choose,

1026
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:57,407
I wish you all the happiness.

1027
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,407
Thank you.

1028
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,327
How does it feel to attend a wedding...

1029
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:10,391
and to be out with my family?

1030
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:13,489
It feels like a picnic at a festival.

1031
00:58:15,334 --> 00:58:17,839
Some are getting married,

1032
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,257
some are reunited as a couple,

1033
00:58:20,257 --> 00:58:22,632
and some are falling in love.

1034
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,938
It's wonderful to see that.

1035
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:27,154
How did you know?

1036
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,744
Did you already know?

1037
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,030
Of course.

1038
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,049
I told you there was to be a celebration.

1039
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,478
Do you mean that secret?

1040
00:58:38,355 --> 00:58:40,911
Are you disappointed it's not about us?

1041
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:43,043
Yes, just a bit.

1042
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,454
When do we tell everyone?

1043
00:58:56,955 --> 00:59:00,430
After dating, we might break up.

1044
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,668
Then our friendship and love...

1045
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,120
will both be gone.

1046
00:59:08,236 --> 00:59:10,626
You might end up regretting it.

1047
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:12,095
Are you okay with that?

1048
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:17,765
Yes, it's better than holding back
and changing nothing.

1049
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:20,492
Are you sure?

1050
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,325
Of course.

1051
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:26,469
Then close your eyes.

1052
00:59:55,979 --> 00:59:57,415
Are you really sure?

1053
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,813
Totally.

1054
01:00:22,725 --> 01:00:24,870
Have you considered our marriage?

1055
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:28,451
Practically speaking,

1056
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:30,920
it could provide us with legal safeguards.

1057
01:00:31,998 --> 01:00:36,005
However, it also takes effort...

1058
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:39,167
to accommodate each other's lifestyles.

1059
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:41,977
There are both good and bad.

1060
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:46,358
But at the end of the day,

1061
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:49,553
sharing each day is what counts.

1062
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:51,854
Yes.

1063
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,701
To you and your loved ones,

1064
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:58,062
I want to become another family.

1065
01:00:58,062 --> 01:01:01,566
Will that work as a special neighbor...

1066
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:05,250
and your lover who lives separately?

1067
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,206
Or if we live that way,

1068
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:12,139
will there be some kind of problem?

1069
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:15,016
Well, I don't know.

1070
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:16,873
You don't know?

1071
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,857
That's not expected from such
a cautious guy like you.

1072
01:01:20,895 --> 01:01:23,605
So what if something happens?

1073
01:01:23,605 --> 01:01:25,524
We're here together to see it through.

1074
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:30,907
I hope nothing bad happens now.

1075
01:01:32,535 --> 01:01:34,121
Because we're together.

1076
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,787
So what if we don't grow up?

1077
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:52,045
There is a child in each grown soul.

1078
01:01:56,561 --> 01:02:00,598
Life can still be great without love.

1079
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:02,430
But one thing is clear.

1080
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,032
Love will remain present in our lives.

1081
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,933
So we're not each other's last love,

1082
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:11,736
but second-to-last love.

1083
01:02:12,836 --> 01:02:16,959
Life is about embracing the future.

1084
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:19,005
And if solitude becomes too dull,

1085
01:02:19,005 --> 01:02:22,260
let's appreciate it with someone.

1086
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:27,742
And whether it's your friend,
lover, spouse, or family,

1087
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:31,046
there will be someone waiting
to share a life with you.

1088
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:32,969
That is undoubtedly enough...

1089
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:35,965
to make you more happy.

1090
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:51,831
(Thank you for supporting and
watching Second to Last Love.)
