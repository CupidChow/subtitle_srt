1
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,159
You scared me!

2
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,759
Ms. Han, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,430
Chief Ko.

4
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,930
Why are you giving this to me?

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,608
Don't go on your blind date.

6
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:27,319
Turn down whoever you're going to meet.

7
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:32,360
I have a crush on you.

8
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:38,108
I'm confessing now before it's too late.

9
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,661
So you can't meet her.

10
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:41,743
All right?

11
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,053
My word.

12
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:05,468
This is my house.

13
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,794
Is this house yours?

14
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:10,159
Too loud! What's all this racket?

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,999
Ko Mi Rye?

16
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:13,465
I'm so sleepy.

17
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:15,654
How do you know my sister?

18
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:17,726
Your sister?

19
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:20,207
Yes, I think you should talk
to my big brother...

20
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:22,598
because he's more objective
than I could ever be...

21
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:25,338
and he makes better decisions
than anyone I know.

22
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,015
Well, I never.

23
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:49,134
(Webtoon writer leaps from
5th floor in protest)

24
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:54,230
How can I even ask favors to
or negotiate with a guy like that?

25
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,411
- Excuse me.
- What you saw earlier...

26
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,847
What's wrong? You had it going.

27
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:17,966
I have something to discuss with you.

28
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,656
If you're free at lunch...

29
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,138
There is nothing to talk about.

30
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,546
Just look for another place
during that time.

31
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:26,567
It's not about that.

32
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:29,185
Do you know what your sister does?

33
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,368
- You see, at my network...
- The plagiarized drama?

34
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,201
Yes, it's about that issue.

35
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,859
I can't believe we let in
a thief next door.

36
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,693
- What?
- You're a crook who swipes...

37
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,403
and steals from others.

38
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,715
- That's not...
- Are you saying our city...

39
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,745
has been helping a drama
that's plagiarized?

40
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,336
That's not my drama.

41
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:50,240
After breaking the rules
and causing trouble recklessly,

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,312
you should admit your wrongdoing
and apologize promptly.

43
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,039
But you drove her to suicide.

44
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,221
What a terrible woman.

45
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,731
Look, just hear me out first.

46
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,077
Move out this instant.

47
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,092

- Mr. Cha.
- Yes, Chief Ko.

52
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:28,093
Bring me last year's schedule
for this event.

53
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:30,021
Sure.

54
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,158
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

55
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:44,946

56
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,520
Here you go.

57

Thanks.

58

I need a whiteout.

59
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,328
- Chief Ko.
- Chief Ko.

60
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,686
- Why are you...
- You can just ask me.

61
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:06,672
Should I do that? I need a whiteout.

62
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,481
Never mind, I have it here.

63
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:12,551
Here is one.

64
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:21,320
All right.

65
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,427
Chief Ko, office dating
is quite common nowadays.

66
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,887
Just relax and don't behave
out of character.

67
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,068
You'd give it all away.

68
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:37,497
If it's found to be plagiarism,

69
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,913
even if we drag out the legal battle,

70
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,937
it will hurt the network's image,

71
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:43,602
force us to cancel all our exports,

72
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,577
and pay compensation costs.

73
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,415
That's a severe financial setback.

74
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,863
We'd lose our jobs and the network.

75
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,632
But why does Producer Gang
have to deal with it?

76
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,007
My point exactly.

77
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,495
No wonder everyone calls her
the troubleshooter.

78
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,768
Why is she taking the bullet
for Producer Han?

79
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,964
What's that?

80
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,585
- There you are.
- Hello.

81
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:05,885
This thing.

82
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:09,925
- Is this hush money?
- Don't talk nonsense.

83
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:12,867
Isn't it from the mayor's wife?

84
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:16,105
It's something she wanted
to give to our male lead,

85
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:17,814
but he treated us instead.

86
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:18,884
What's in here?

87
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:19,884
Let's open it.

88
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,603
That guy even turned down treats...

89
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:31,398

Nobody is looking under your shirt.

95
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,623
What did you say?

96
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:53,894
That's an inappropriate remark.

97
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:56,551
You feel harassed way too often.

- It's not plagiarized.

That's a different series from
the same network.

Are you sure?

105

Then why didn't you check
before letting it run?

What do you mean you can't?

It's nothing.

Yes.

Me?

146
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,702
You told me off regarding the drama.

00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,925
I might be a contract worker,

148
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,614
but it was merely a trailer.

149

Not even thirty seconds.

150
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,675
That's not what I meant.

151
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:21,488
It was wrong to slack off
during work hours.

152
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,453
But just because I like you,

153
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:27,213
it doesn't mean you can walk
all over me that way!

154
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,389
All right. I went too far.

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,111
I'm in the wrong.

156
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,638
It's okay now.

157
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:45,102
- What?
- I told you how I feel.

00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:21,414
Ms. Han, anyway...

170
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:23,742
- Is there someone else?
- What?

171
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:27,452
Are you rejecting me because
there already is a woman?

172
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,326
Why would there be a woman?

173
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,222
What about your blind date?

174
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,018
What blind date? Are you nuts?

175
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,706
Then it's okay.

176
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,808
Listen to me.

177
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,975
I don't know what got into your head,

178
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,000
but you can't behave this way.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,882
What's not allowed?

180
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,765
What did I even ask of you?

181
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:51,791
I'm not asking you to marry me
or move in together.

182
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,743
I honestly told you how I feel,

183
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:59,557
so let's start by flirting.

184
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,876
Flirting?

185
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,651
I'm asking to meet with you...

186
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:08,690
not because of the house lease.

187
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,717
There is something to discuss
regarding your sister's issue.

188
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:16,847
(Recipient: Senseless Man)

189
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,109
My word, hello.

190
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:27,106
There you are.

191
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,265
I heard that you were busy.

192
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,689
Where is Producer Han?

193
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,941
You can speak to me today. Give it here.

194
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,371
I don't want to.

195
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,923
I revised it based on what
Producer Han said,

196
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,615
so I'll talk with him.

197
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,557
I'm the chief producer of this drama.

198
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,587
But I'm not a random dog.

199
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,218
Why would I wag at everyone,

200
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,706
asking to be petted with love?

201
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,475
That could end with plagiarizing
and killing myself.

202
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,739
What did you say?

203
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,580
I hear you got a webtoon
writer to kill herself.

204
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,692
It was a suicide protest, not suicide.

205
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,467
Can't you read the news right?

206
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,467
Anyway.

207
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:08,060
Your sense of romance is, well...

208
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,530
It's just not my cup of tea.

209
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,389
You don't seem to know what
women want lately.

210
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,213
Ko Mi Rye.

211
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,464
You, get up this instant!

212
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,870
What?

213
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:43,281
What's this about?

214
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,703
(SBC "You Can't Make Me Love"
plagiarism scandal)

215
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,107
Get out here.

216
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,929
Webtoon? Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:01,377
Why would I talk about it?

218
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:03,427
There isn't anything
with my name on it yet.

219
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,614
Is that why you copied that drama?

220
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:13,012
Who said that? Who?

221
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,377
The woman who moved next door?

222
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:19,722
She's twisted under that sweet coating.

223
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,641
After asking me to drop the lawsuit,

224
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,401
is she saying that
I copied material instead?

225
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,216
She must be frantic about the ruling.

226
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,569
You didn't say a word about
all of this going on.

227
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,556
And now you shove this on me?

228
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:35,422
I could only think of you.

229
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,338
Is what you said true?

230
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:41,554
Of course. Why would I lie?

231
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,865
They have nothing on me.

232
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,793
Do you see that? I've got nothing to lose.

233
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,634
They played me for a fool.

234
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,960
How could they accuse me instead?

235
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,101
Where is that woman? Where?

236
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,608
What are you even saying?

237
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,352
What's this nonsense?

238
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:03,749
When is the ruling?

239
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,985
In two days. I told you that already.

240
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:13,528
If that's your story, drop the case...

241
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,234
It's out of the question.

242
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,578
Wait a minute.

243
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,708
Absolutely not. It shouldn't happen.

244
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,627
The law can take care of it,
so why bother?

245
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:30,874
As I said, Mi Rye will get a chance...

246
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,732
No, don't even think about it.

247
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,754
- Look.
- We're done talking.

248
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:39,330
Show this woman the door.

249
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,679
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,626
Did you say he makes
better decisions than anyone?

251
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:48,965
Yes, he knows precisely what to do.

252
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:53,877
You must be glad to have a sharp
and wonderful brother.

253
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,267
It's like talking to a brick wall.

254
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,221
What a roadblock in her way.

255
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,595
You're the one who first threw dirt.

256
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:13,309
Mi Rye's future is on the line here.

257
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,003
If you settle, we're ready to help with...

258
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,083
whatever she wants for herself.

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,017
She could take up a position
as a scriptwriter...

260
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,050
or get a shot with her webtoon...

261
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,375
So she can become like you?

262
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,920
Is this how you got to where you are?

263
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:35,053
You're the big-shot producer at SBC,

264
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:36,918
but after bossing around everyone,

265
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:39,087
you hide when things go south...

266
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,950
and resort to shady tricks
like an opportunist.

267
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,813
There now, that's a bit harsh.

268
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,550
I'm suggesting it for both sides...

269
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,031
Your suggestion? We don't need it.

270
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,622
Just take responsibility for
what you did wrong.

271
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:55,087
And don't drag my family into it.

272
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:56,615
What are you even saying?

273
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,927
My family is doing just fine,

274
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,191
so you stay clear.

275
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:23,109
Are you not from around here?
You're a new face.

276
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,808
I moved a few days ago.

277
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,992
Why are you drinking alone
with your looks?

278
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,431
I guess life is hard on everyone.

279
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:47,424
Do you know Ko Sang Sik
from the city hall?

280
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,939
I know him well. Why?

281
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,244
What kind of person is he?

282
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,942
Well, let's see.

283
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:58,533
He's a real stickler for rules.

284
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,109
There isn't an ounce of compromise...

285
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:03,056
and not a single crack in his armor.

286
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,869
He's a civil servant through and through.

287
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,413
But isn't there some weakness in him?

288
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,407
There is plenty.

289
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,473
He's starting to lose hair.

290
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:14,432
There is no woman in his life.

291
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:17,576
And his weakest point is his family.

292
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,921
There is nothing he wouldn't do for them.

293
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,625
He takes care of them well.

294
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,831
That bunch is far from ordinary.

295
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,302
It is a bit of a snag.

296
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:29,949
He flips out when family
gets into the mix.

297
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:34,190
So you shouldn't ever get
on their bad side.

298
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,304
Or he'll start breathing fire.

299
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:43,884
Good grief, my head.

300
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,937
Is that why you escorted the filming?

301
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:53,106
Yes, she is the chief producer.

302
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,105
Given all that trouble and Mi Rye's issue,

303
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,729
it's best to stay clear of her.

304
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:59,349
Why are you worked up about it?

305
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,123
I think she's all right.

306
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,861
Are you kidding me?

307
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,653
Why even lease away your place?

308
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,423
I want to be around the family
under one roof.

309
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,427
It's better than living alone.

310
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,557
My goodness.

311
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:18,337
Bro, it's time to move on.

312
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:21,600
Think less about the family
and enjoy your life.

313
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,934
You go ahead.

314
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,144
I'm satisfied with my life.

315
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:27,711
Why bottle up your feelings?

316
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,211
I know it gets tough with
your responsibility.

317
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,919
It makes sense at my age.

318
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,957
Yes, but I'm still too young to relate.

319
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,853
My plan is to enjoy life.

320
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,065
Life is that simple.

321
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,557
Show your face!

322
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,000
Someone should be responsible!

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,105
All he did was work hard,
but it cost him his life!

324
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,073
- You killed him!
- Mom.

325
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:04,746
- Calm down.
- Tell him to come out!

326
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:07,226
Come out now!

327
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:11,291
How could this happen?

328
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,473
How could this even happen?

329
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:46,164
Can't she go easy on the drinks?

330
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,290
Nope.

331
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:54,392
Someone got on my nerves today,

332
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:55,873
so I had a few too many.

333
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,532
Wait? What?

334
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,672
Let go of me.

335
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:07,481
You sexually harass your employee.

336
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,534
What did you just say?

337
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,940
Who are you to talk after plagiarizing?

338
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,170
- Good grief.
- What's with a drama, anyway?

339
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,183
If you wanted your own content
to comfort people,

340
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,886
you shouldn't have taken credit
for someone else's work.

341
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:26,230
Yes, you're so in the right.

342
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,046
But I lack responsibility...

343
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:31,484
and recklessly cause trouble,

344
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:33,709
so stealing is in my nature.

345
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,902
I know it wasn't your drama.

346
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,989
It's tough enough to handle
your own problems.

347
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,155
So why even bother taking
the blame for others?

348
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,651
Meddling like that is what
makes life exhausting.

349
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,076
Thanks for that.

350
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:55,851
I suppose sticking to the rules
makes your life easier,

351
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,821
and your family has it going well.

352
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,549
That's right.

353
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,748
You don't deserve to be with
such good people,

354
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:05,458
so move out already.

355
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,526
Look here.

356
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:10,637
Do you know me that well?

357
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,732
Who are you to judge so quickly...

358
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,244
and insult me with your criticism?

359
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:17,642
Save your drunken talk.

360
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,453
You should sober up first.

361
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:20,996
You, there!

362
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,381
This isn't the booze talking.

363
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,468
I'm a thief, fraud, and opportunist!

364
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:25,629
So what, woman!

365
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:26,719
What are you doing?

366
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,487
Are you insane?
Who are you trying to touch?

367
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:42,093
Wait, where is my hairpin?

368
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,254
- I didn't mean to...
- My goodness.

369
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,020
- Look here.
- Why are you on my case?

370
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,318
I shouldn't drag your family into it?

371
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,517
We all have our loved ones,
and yet only yours matter?

372
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:05,325
Now I feel tragic living alone.

373
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,286
It must be nice to protect your family.

374
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,992
Do you think this is what I want?

375
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,068
You!

376
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,797
Calm down. And the hairpin...

377
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,200
I've lost the fire in me.

378
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:38,656
The buzz is kicking in.

379
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,184
I thought things would be different
as a grown-up.

380
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,271
I wanted to be gentle and easy-going...

381
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,249
as I aged into adulthood.

382
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:03,763
I'm a thief who moved in?

383
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:10,282
Resorting to shady tricks
like an opportunist?

384
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,183
What did you just say?

385
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,832
You!

386
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,301
That's ridiculous.

387
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,905
I believed that I would get wiser...

388
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,013
and find peace in my heart.

389
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,691
This isn't how I pictured myself
as a grown-up.

390
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:40,612
This isn't how I pictured myself
as a grown-up.

391
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:06,761
When will my car get delivered?

392
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,611
I signed with you ages ago.

393
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,540
Have it parked outside my house.

394
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,765
Hop on. Where are you going with that?

395
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,046
I'd rather not.

396
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,286
Why not?

397
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:29,341
I don't want to get involved
with your family.

398
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,581
It's not like getting your hands dirty.

399
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,611
I'm not blood-related, so you can ride.

400
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:38,467
But you live with them.

401
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:43,032
By the way, who did your flooring?

402
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,339
I did.

403
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:48,005
I'll help if you need anything fixed.

404
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,871
That's okay. I can help myself.

405
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,202
I'm on my way.

406
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:09,219
Don't count the seconds,
but just keep busy.

407
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,845
You could sleep, read a book,
or watch some TV.

408
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:36,705
Drop the case?

409
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:39,146
Absolutely not. It shouldn't happen.

410
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,457
What's with a drama, anyway?

411
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,459
If you wanted your own content
to comfort people,

412
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,180
you shouldn't have taken credit
for someone else's work.

413
00:25:57,826 --> 00:25:58,890
Hello.

414
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,209
Producer Han, are you editing?

415
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,331
How did it go?

416
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,391
It didn't go well.

417
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,388
What? Seriously?

418
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:10,903
Just admit it was plagiarized...

419
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,080
What are you even saying?

420
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,786
I'm busy, so let's talk later.

421
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:28,788
Cut to the title.

422
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:33,473
- Working hard?
- What brings you here?

423
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:35,756
Producer Han just finished up
and headed home.

424
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:38,679
Are you sure he left?

425
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,775
- Yes.
- Did you get everything?

426
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,850
Of course, we'll be airing soon.

427
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,221
Turn it off if you're not watching.

428
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,627
I'm going to watch that drama.

429
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,306
("You Can't Make Me Love")

430
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:04,842
Why would you watch it?

431
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,219
It's fun.

432
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,799
Fun? Don't you have any self-pride?

433
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,549
What? Don't turn it off.

434
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:13,691
This drama is an adaptation of
the webtoon "Only You Love?"

435
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,460
We apologize for this late notice.

436
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,388
Your support is appreciated.

437
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,358
(Original Writers: Hwang Ja Kka
and Ko Mi Rye)

438
00:27:22,358 --> 00:27:24,438
- Look there.
- What? Why? Look where?

439
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,438
For crying out loud.

440
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:29,610
(Original writers: Hwang Ja Kka
and Ko Mi Rye)

441
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:33,044
Ko Mi Rye!

442
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,699
Ko Mi Rye!

443
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:41,606
Ko Mi Rye!

444
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,670
(Original Writers: Hwang Ja Kka
and Ko Mi Rye)

445
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,090
- Right there.
- What?

446
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,341
Ko Mi Rye! Ko Mi Rye!

447
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:59,365
(Original Writers: Hwang Ja Kka
and Ko Mi Rye)

448
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,594
Gang Min Ju, pick up.

449
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:16,802
Boss, did you see the drama?

450
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:19,691
The caption named the webtoon
with an apology.

451
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,891
Are you out of your mind?

452
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:23,282
Do you own this network?

453
00:28:23,282 --> 00:28:25,795
You must be crazy to pull this off.

454
00:28:25,795 --> 00:28:27,588
Wait, where is Gang Min Ju?

455
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,522
Get her on the phone!

456
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,821
Someone needs to step up for once.

457
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,337
Even if there is a price to pay,

458
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,482
I'm trying to be that person.

459
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:53,912
As a responsible grown-up,

460
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:56,210
it feels nice to make that call.

461
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:07,836
Look, Gang Min Ju!

462
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,108
What in the world? Why'd you do that?

463
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:12,919
You didn't even bother asking me.

464
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:17,394
Gang Min Ju, how could you?

465
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:19,534
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,817
That doesn't cut it, so tell us why.

467
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:25,547
As you all know,

468
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:28,406
there was a suicide protest.

469
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,693
When it's a matter of life and death,

470
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,535
I couldn't stand by and watch.

471
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:34,397
You, Gang Min Ju!

472
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,089
All that praising from others
has clearly gone to your head.

473
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,038
What will happen to Producer Gang?

474
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:48,379
What do you think? They'll call her out.

475
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,756
Do you think she might get fired?

476
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,130
Let's get back to work.

477
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,905
We don't want to miss the deadline.

478
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,793
This came in the morning.

479
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:58,377
What is it?

480
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,473
Woori City won't cooperate anymore.

481
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:03,128
They suggest that we check with
another city or team.

482
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:05,041
I can't believe this guy.

483
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,719
He's like a total roadblock.

484
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,044
I can't agree more.

485
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,490
Deputy Mayor.

486
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:17,746
No need.

487
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:19,506
Since you were so insistent...

488
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:21,721
about not cooperating with the filming,

489
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:24,697
I went ahead and signed your request.

490
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,440
Yes, I received it.

491
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,123
I know you're swamped with work.

492
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:30,110
Are you familiar with Shin Seok Gi?

493
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,019
- Yes.
- He has been promoted...

494
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:36,559
as the head of Economics and Culture.

495
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,155
So you'll work with him.

496
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:42,642
There he comes.

497
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,193
Good morning.

498
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:48,602
You're looking good.

499
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:52,249
We meet again, Ko Sang Sik.

500
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,681
I trust you'll do a good job.

501
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,990
Yes, sir.

502
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:09,747
I look forward to working with you.

503
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,194
Boss.

504
00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:20,878
Woori City will cooperate with us
through another team.

505
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,280
Yes, but how did it go?

506
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,983
I'm told to hang tight at home.

507
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,566
There will be disciplinary action.

508
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:30,096
How can you be calm about it?

509
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,761
You're not quitting, are you?

510
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:35,663
I'm tired, so let's talk later.

511
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,663
Min Ju.

512
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:44,469
There were so many struggles
to get to where you are.

513
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,573
But you powered through them all.

514
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:52,021
Even with what took Eun Ho.

515
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,833
Yeong Ae.

516
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,814
You're why I've been sticking around.

517
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:06,780
Are you going to throw it all away?

518
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,454
Min Ju.

519
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,052
I'm off.

520
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:25,918
You won't drink it off with me?

521
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,205
Min Ju.

522
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,918
Producer Gang!

523
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,805
You're looking good.

524
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,386
We meet again, Ko Sang Sik.

525
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,936
I trust you'll do a good job.

526
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:54,858
Chief Ko, I'll repeat the question.

527
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,392
Tell us your answer.

528
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,629
Did Deputy Assistant Shin Seok Gi...

529
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:02,919
really accept the money?

530
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,850
Yes, he did.

531
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,831
Wait, you bastard!

532
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,732
You call yourself my boss?

533
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:19,035
Any decent one would have
my back, you loser!

534
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,761
You crazy bastard!

535
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:22,578
You think you're so clean, do you?

536
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:25,689
Don't think that you're above
all the filthy muck!

537
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:26,817
Just you wait!

538
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:29,760
I'll blow your cover someday!

539
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:31,195
Let go!

540
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,456
Let go!

541
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,892
Given how he survived that,

542
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,127
this place is far from being clean.

543
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:57,457
(SBC drama "Bubbling Love"
films at Woori City)

544
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:08,640
Hello.

545
00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:11,304
This is for you.

546
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,118
What's this?

547
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,937
You gave me credit on the screen.

548
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,725
It's okay. I did what was needed.

549
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:23,309
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:24,393
Don't be.

551
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,377
Thank you.

552
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:12,948
What's this?

553
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:37,757
- Cut!
- Cut!

554
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:39,518
That was great, but do it one more time.

555
00:35:39,518 --> 00:35:40,713
One more time.

556
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,684
Let's roll.

557
00:35:51,602 --> 00:35:53,508
Cut. Okay.

558
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:55,267
Okay, get to the next location.

559
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,211
Good work, everybody.

560
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,491
Great work.

561
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,614
Great work.

562
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:01,517
Eun Ho, I need your help.

563
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:02,830
Okay, I'll be right there.

564
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,821
My goodness,
I want to get married already.

565
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:08,939
You make me jealous.

566
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:11,370
My girlfriend recently got into SBC.

567
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,754
She wants to produce dramas like you.

568
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,027
I popped the question before anyone.

569
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:18,084
You can't miss our wedding.

570
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,341
Come and check out my bride.

571
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:12,015
- Hello.
- Thanks for everything.

572
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:42,496
Look here!

573
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,863
What are you doing here?

574
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,798
You caught me again.

575
00:37:54,798 --> 00:37:56,405
I want to check out this place.

576
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:59,505
Isn't it too daring with a skirt?

577
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,506
You made it for people to come up.

578
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:03,506
Isn't that right?

579
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:04,507
Good grief.

580
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:08,330
Watch your step.

581
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:13,470
Wearing a skirt when it's not all built.

582
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,816
Stop with your lecturing.

583
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,710
Are you okay?

584
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:47,347
How refreshing.

585
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:50,908
It's amazing up here. I love it.

586
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:52,150
This was my work.

587
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,131
Are you serious?

588
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,677
That's impressive.

589
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:02,069
My word, there is even a birdcage.

590
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:06,932
My goodness.

591
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,656
Goodness.

592
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,611
There are eggs inside.

593
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,683
The mother bird is Yeong Hee.

594
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:16,493
Is the father named Cheol Su?

595
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:17,880
You know it well.

596
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,966
That's too tacky.
You should pick classy names.

597
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,158
Like Harry and Sally.

598
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:25,500
That would make them bicker all day.

599
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,114
Were Yeong Hee and Cheol Su happy?

600
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,228
How would I know?

601
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:33,059
But you know Harry and Sally.

602
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,637
I'm no stranger to movies.

603
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,335
By the way, here.

604
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,593
What's this?

605
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:45,416
It's your hairpin that broke.

606
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,135
I see.

607
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,715
I watched the drama.

608
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:55,688
I said to take responsibility,
not cause trouble.

609
00:39:56,636 --> 00:40:00,038
I didn't have the nerve, so I went rogue.

610
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:04,421
Weren't you afraid to make that choice?

611
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:06,755
There was no choice when
tricks or talk failed.

612
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,391
So I played by the rules.

613
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:10,845
Despite burying our heads in the sand,

614
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:13,709
it's all going to catch up.

615
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,844
The truth is bound to come out.

616
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:19,910
So are you paying the price
away from work?

617
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:22,165
All they can do is fire me.

618
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,142
With your self-important ways,

619
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,532
you must have breezed through life.

620
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:31,896
Not exactly.

621
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:35,889
Maybe compared to some others.

622
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:39,528
Why move out here when
you can live in Seoul?

623
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:42,271
Are you telling me to move out?

624
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:46,735
Can I come here often?

625
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,468
Just for strolls.

626
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,382
And don't do anything dangerous.

627
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:52,116
No stepping into the fountain.

628
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,502
You shouldn't ever come alone.

629
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,165
Are you looking out for me?

630
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,611
Or are you worried about this place?

631
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:02,802
Well, of course...

632
00:41:02,802 --> 00:41:05,233
It's better than asking me
to pack my bags.

633
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:11,246
- Let's get down.
- Why? I want to stay longer.

634
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:12,821
I'm a busy person.

635
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:14,895
All right, you can go ahead.

636
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,268
My word, wait right there!

637
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:30,872
- I'm glad to see you.
- Hello.

638
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,425
Do you like your new place?

639
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:33,952
Yes, it's nice.

640
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,000
You look so much older than
when we first met.

641
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,257
There are more wrinkles.

642
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:40,737
I guess age does that to you.

643
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:42,343
What?

644
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:45,590
This is a housewarming gift.

645
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,711
Try some.

646
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:48,998
What's this?

647
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:50,695
Well, you see...

648
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,313
It helps with squeezing.

649
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,198
What?

650
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:59,475
It's what helps you squeeze.

651
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:01,830
How should I put it?

652
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,463
It's good for women with menopause.

653
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,214
No, it's okay.

654
00:42:08,214 --> 00:42:11,328
Come on, just give it a shot.

655
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,144
You'll feel the effect when
you take it regularly.

656
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:16,817
Yes, thank you.

657
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,579
- I appreciate it.
- Okay.

658
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,363
- Take care.
- Bye.

659
00:42:29,689 --> 00:42:30,796
Who's there?

660
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:36,002
Who are you? Wait!

661
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,900
Kid!

662
00:42:40,553 --> 00:42:41,589
Kid!

663
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,075
My goodness.

664
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:51,227
That's my new car.

665
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:53,094
New car?

666
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:56,950
For crying out loud.

667
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,932
If you're not here to steal,

668
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:02,282
what were you doing in my house?

669
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:06,475
Aren't you going to talk?

670
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:07,666
I'm sorry.

671
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,862
That's all you have been saying.

672
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,942
What's this?

673
00:43:13,914 --> 00:43:15,069
Don't take that.

674
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,362
Tell your mom to come here.

675
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,551
Call her.

676
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,292
I don't have a mom.

677
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:34,259
- What?
- I don't have one.

678
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:36,729
What's going on here?

679
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,953
Dad.

680
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:49,137
Did she just call you Dad?

681
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,512
Yes, she's my daughter.

682
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:54,435
Ye Ji, what's the matter?

683
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:57,301
I left something in that house,

684
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,754
so I went to get it back.

685
00:43:59,754 --> 00:44:03,208
But this middle-aged woman here,
she caught me.

686
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,059
- What did you call her?
- Middle-aged woman?

687
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:07,578
Let me see.

688
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:15,497
Get back in the house.

689
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:17,371
Now.

690
00:44:22,238 --> 00:44:25,355
Is she really your daughter?

691
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:29,507
What's all this?

692
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:34,183
As you can see, it's my new car.

693
00:44:34,183 --> 00:44:37,915
But your daughter dropped
this pot on the roof.

694
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,442
He has a daughter?

695
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:49,641
For goodness' sake.

696
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,575
(Treat your noble existence.)

697
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:08,166
"Immunity boost for women with menopause."

698
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,690
"Stress reliever."

699
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
What?

700
00:45:29,023 --> 00:45:30,235
What brings you here?

701
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:32,962
Have you fixed your floor?

702
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:33,997
Not yet.

703
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,253
- That's what I thought.
- No, I can do it.

704
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:37,391
You can just leave it.

705
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:38,842
What are neighbors for?

706
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:40,637
It's really okay.

707
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,019
What? You hurt your hand.

708
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,328
It's nothing.

709
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:47,500
There it is.

710
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:53,896
I also get hurt while cooking.

711
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:56,195
- Take a seat.
- Don't worry about it.

712
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:58,007
Just sit.

713
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:01,725
The kitchen sink needs fixing...

714
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,540
and so does the squeaky floor.

715
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,665
I'll get it done quickly.

716
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:07,665
Here.

717
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:10,628
Tell me if you need anything else.

718
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:12,118
I can take care of it.

719
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:15,736
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

720
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:21,002
This is something a man does for you.

721
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:23,064
No wonder you're single.

722
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:32,118
What? Why are you here?

723
00:46:32,118 --> 00:46:33,943
It's about your car.

724
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:37,127
- Sang Sik.
- Yes, what brings you here?

725
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,592
I came to make some repairs.

726
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:40,110
I see.

727
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,837
There is a repair shop nearby.

728
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:46,398
Give them a call.
I'm sorry about your new car.

729
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:48,342
Did something happen?

730
00:46:49,395 --> 00:46:51,835
Yes, there was a little mishap.

731
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,154
Ye Ji got home.

732
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:55,114
Fix whatever you need here,

733
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:57,018
and let's have dinner together.

734
00:46:57,018 --> 00:46:58,030
Okay.

735
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,627
Jun Woo, hurry down.

736
00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:01,812
It's all right.

737
00:47:01,812 --> 00:47:03,987
I can handle it by myself.

738
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,536
I'll go after this.

739
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:22,838
That is far too loud!

740
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:26,443
You, get back here.

741
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,867
This isn't some treasure.

742
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:29,754
- Why hide it next door?
- It's mine.

743
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:32,682
You two! You're being too loud!

744
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:37,691
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

745
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:43,352
Ko Ye Ji, come here and sit down.

746
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:47,239
Good luck. Hang in there.

747
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,132
Give it back.

748
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:55,907
Well done.

749
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,077
Look what this got you into!

750
00:47:58,077 --> 00:48:00,069
I didn't know someone had moved in.

751
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:02,188
It was Uncle Jun Woo's place.

752
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:03,836
Why did you even stash it there?

753
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:06,707
You don't respect my taste
if I leave it here.

754
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:08,700
I'll deduct the repair cost...

755
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,669
from your allowance every month.

756
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:11,875
Dad!

757
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,135
And this thing.

758
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:17,175
Just leave it in your room.

759
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:19,766
I'm the only parent you have.

760
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:22,622
Promise me you won't hide stuff from me.

761
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:26,210
Only if you don't act like a boomer.

762
00:48:27,752 --> 00:48:28,964
Do you promise that or not?

763
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:31,273
I promise.

764
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:32,291
Okay.

765
00:48:45,016 --> 00:48:46,482
Why are there so many?

766
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:50,722
There are even flowers in his hair.

767
00:48:54,927 --> 00:48:56,562
Good grief.

768
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:12,610
(Homebody)

769
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:22,338
(Grim Reaper)

770
00:49:23,515 --> 00:49:24,591
What?

771
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:29,578
Thank you.

772
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:32,425
My word, it's been a long time.

773
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:34,339
After finishing up my classes,

774
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,221
I've been way too active at night.

775
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:38,383
So all the beads fell off.

776
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:39,850
That's too bad.

777
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:44,376
I haven't seen you here before.
What work do you do?

778
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:47,203
Just bits of this and that.

779
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:50,870
You must be in several businesses.

780
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,636
Well, I'm just...

781
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,837
Yes, it's like that.

782
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:58,437
Your wife must be so happy.

783
00:49:58,437 --> 00:50:00,830
I can't wait to tie the knot.

784
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,932
Well, it's not always a fairytale.

785
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:06,069
Instead of living with regret...

786
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,829
or going through a divorce,

787
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:10,362
it's better to embrace being single.

788
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:11,996
You're alone in life, anyway.

789
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,683
You must be divorced like me.

790
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:18,131
Sorry, I had no idea.

791
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,261
It's not like that.

792
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:22,756
After hitting middle age,

793
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,828
I can't stand the daily grind
and feel empty.

794
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:27,629
That messes with my self-esteem.

795
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:31,509
So I came here to look nice for a change.

796
00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:33,189
You still look young.

797
00:50:33,189 --> 00:50:34,601
Really?

798
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:37,983
Those muscles don't do you any justice.

799
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:41,873
You should come by.

800
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:44,604
Exercise means making the time.

801
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,360
It's not about killing time.

802
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,210
No wonder.

803
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,183
Look, is your car at the shop?

804
00:51:05,183 --> 00:51:08,282
Come on. I'm talking to you.

805
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:12,091
Why are you covered in this heat?

806
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:17,273
I'm going to the dermatologist.

807
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,490
What happened to your face?
Did you eat something bad?

808
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,920
You told me to stay clear of your family,

809
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,170
but your family isn't returning the favor.

810
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,297
Do you even realize that?

811
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:26,871
What in the world happened?

812
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,272
This is what happened.

813
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,780
Your sister gave it to me. The older one.

814
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,652
Why is she still peddling this stuff?

815
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:38,448
Give it back.

816
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,865
I need to check with the doctor
for any side effects.

817
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,134
Wait, why did you even take it?

818
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,593
It's because she gave it to me
and said it squeezes...

819
00:51:47,014 --> 00:51:49,601
For immunity and stress.

820
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,855
I can't believe that girl.

821
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,115
Look...

822
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,568
For crying out loud.

823
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,221
Why didn't you show up when I called?

824
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,422
You knew it could have side effects.

825
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:07,837
So why give it to her?

826
00:52:07,837 --> 00:52:11,621
You see, I didn't have a choice.

827
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:12,901
What are you talking about?

828
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:16,148
My husband has been teaching for ages,

829
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,165
but there's no hint of promotion.

830
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:22,300
The man can't even suck up.

831
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,004
You know that.

832
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:25,132
So what?

833
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:28,480
The principal's wife sells it,
so how could I not?

834
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:32,998
Where is he now?

835
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:34,422
I don't know.

836
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:38,206
He's been getting home late
and going out a lot.

837
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,989
He doesn't even take my calls.

838
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,678
Then why bother with him?

839
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:44,356
Because I love him.

840
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:46,875
I love him with all my heart.

841
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:51,077
I just want my family of three
to have a good life.

842
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:52,672
That's why I did it.

843
00:52:54,764 --> 00:52:56,079
Seriously.

844
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,026
I can't believe you.

845
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,573
Uncle, what brings you here?

846
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:06,981
Mom, this is making me break out.

847
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,860
Why did you take it?

848
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,698
It's only for women.

849
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:13,328
For real?

850
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,472
Hello, Min Ju.

851
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,691
What's wrong with your face?

852
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:27,470
My goodness.

853
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,459
What did I tell you? Without a guy,

854
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,746
your hormones get messed up,
and your skin breaks out.

855
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:33,873
That's not why.

856
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:35,585
Then what? Why are you like this?

857
00:53:35,585 --> 00:53:38,915
It's because of my neighbors.

858
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,524
- Your neighbors?
- Yes.

859
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:43,571
They wrecked my skin, my car,

860
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:44,933
and even my sanity.

861
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:47,868
Why is your car wrecked when
you got a new one?

862
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:49,190
I don't know.

863
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:52,615
What? What happened to you?

864
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:05,634
What's that?

865
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:07,052
My word!

866
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:10,497
You scared me.

867
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,851
What's keeping you these days?

868
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:16,122
What do you think?
I'm busy teaching at school.

869
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:18,072
The school let out already.

870
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,182
Get yourself home.

871
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:23,856
Take care of my sister, got it?

872
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:26,743
You're dead if I catch you cheating.

873
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:29,398
Why would I do that?

874
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:31,277
Don't worry.

875
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:34,273
Has she caused trouble again?

876
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,682
You go ask her.

877
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,035
Come to Ye Ji's final match.

878
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:44,918
No, she'll win anyway.

879
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:51,654
Come on! That's our idol!

880
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,516
- No!
- Please!

881
00:54:53,516 --> 00:54:55,414
Posting here is against the law.

882
00:54:57,979 --> 00:54:59,989
Zip it already.

883
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:01,918
If you're not going to help, beat it.

884
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:03,132
Good grief.

885
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:05,254
- Such a boomer.
- Geezer.

886
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:06,437
What did you say?

887
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:08,489
Well, I never.

888
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:10,817
What's with all this fuss, anyway?

889
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:11,883
What are you doing?

890
00:55:13,197 --> 00:55:14,890
Well, it's you.

891
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,988
I'm doing a road check.

892
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:18,467
Road what?

893
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:22,003
There is work around the clock
for public servants.

894
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:25,003
With unauthorized posters in the area,

895
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:26,507
it's my job to remove them.

896
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,171
That's impressive.

897
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:31,271
This is the hottest group nowadays.
Do you even know them?

898
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,245
Of course.

899
00:55:34,245 --> 00:55:38,936
Do you think I'm some geezer? Seriously.

900
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:42,134
I have tickets for their concert.

901
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:44,423
If you're free on Saturday,
take your daughter...

902
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,276
Aren't you too old for this stuff?

903
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,629
The group came to say hello...

904
00:55:48,629 --> 00:55:51,156
and offered the tickets as a promo.

905
00:55:51,156 --> 00:55:54,221
You must be very popular
with young idol members.

906
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:56,652
Your daughter came to me...

907
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:59,719
and apologized for my car.
So this is a gift.

908
00:56:00,197 --> 00:56:01,428
Ye Ji did that?

909
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:03,438
At least she has good manners.

910
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:05,010
Do you want them or not?

911
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:06,912
Saturday at the end of this week?

912
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:11,206
It won't work.

913
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:15,262
My daughter has a final match
in an English tournament.

914
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:18,660
She must have the brains.

915
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,381
Ye Ji is also an all-rounder
in art and sports.

916
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:24,632
She takes after my smart genes.

917
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:27,201
I see.

918
00:56:28,504 --> 00:56:29,880
Then don't let me keep you.

919
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,678
Your face looks somewhat better.

920
00:56:36,678 --> 00:56:39,443
Maybe not better, but it sort of does.

921
00:56:45,254 --> 00:56:46,904
Take me to that concert.

922
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:50,944
What's with your face?

923
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:55,037
The stress must have gotten to you.

924
00:56:58,154 --> 00:56:59,947
"Pretending to Be An Adult."

925
00:56:59,947 --> 00:57:02,660
You tucked away the idol tickets
in a book about adults.

926
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,670
How ironic.

927
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,774
You can take me there.

928
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:07,737
Why would I go to their concert?

929
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,358
- What?
- Don't pretend to be an adult.

930
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:13,423
Having fun listening to music
like carefree kids...

931
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:15,223
could be a healing experience.

932
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,335
You had it rough at work.

933
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,421
Okay, we're going.

934
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:27,757
Ye Ji.

935
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:30,491
It's the big day.

936
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:31,747
How did you know that?

937
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:33,939
Your uncle told me about it.

938
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:36,197
I heard today is the final run.

939
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:39,318
Well, yes.

940
00:57:40,348 --> 00:57:41,802
Why aren't you pumped?

941
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:43,956
Are you having doubts? Should I be there?

942
00:57:43,956 --> 00:57:45,765
No, I'm out of here.

943
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:48,869
Ye Ji.

944
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,584
- You can do it.
- That's not how you do it.

945
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:56,607
Watch and learn.

946
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,417
You can do it. I love you.

947
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:03,242
I love you.

948
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:08,954
Being a healthy dessert doesn't mean
it should look bad.

949
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:13,265
That's because your eyes
get the first bite.

950
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,638
And once it hits your taste buds,

951
00:58:16,638 --> 00:58:19,498
you can be amazed all over again.

952
00:58:20,535 --> 00:58:22,489
That's it for today.

953
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,419
Thank you.

954
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,104
Here.

955
00:58:39,673 --> 00:58:41,369
This is a palate pleaser.

956
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,052
- Good?
- It's good!

957
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,701
Start selling it today!

958
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,796
Sang Sik, it's me.

959
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:53,220
Yes, what's up?

960
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,971
I can't find Ye Ji anywhere
for the final round.

961
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,528
- What?
- She was here before.

962
00:59:00,528 --> 00:59:02,835
You're not with her, are you?

963
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,563
Call up her friends...

964
00:59:04,563 --> 00:59:06,286
and ask them if they know.

965
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:08,798
I swear.

966
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:18,657
Are you really okay with this?

967
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:20,201
What's the big deal?

968
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:22,297
This makes me feel like a bad guy.

969
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:24,691
I'm dead if your dad finds out.

970
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:28,724
Everything about you is great,
but you are too nice.

971
00:59:31,745 --> 00:59:33,122
Did you locate her?

972
00:59:33,122 --> 00:59:34,751
Where is she?

973
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,889
Where?

974
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,568
No, I'll get her myself.

975
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:53,609
We're all sold out.

976
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:55,201
No tickets?

977
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:56,794
I'm not here for the show.

978
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,898
I just need to bring someone out.

979
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,101
I'm sorry.

980
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:06,723
What am I going to do?

981
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:09,386
I've been longing for this day!

982
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,682
What else can you do? Just go.

983
01:00:11,682 --> 01:00:13,491
You know it can't be helped.

984
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:17,013
Why does my great-grandpa
have to marry today?

985
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,140
You should hurry.

986
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:22,085
What about this ticket?

987
01:01:22,483 --> 01:01:25,513
Hello? You there?

988
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:26,601
Can you hear me?

989
01:01:27,575 --> 01:01:29,059
Hello?

990
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:35,502
The biggest group of the century, VIXX!

991
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:37,438
The concert is about to start.

992
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:38,649
Are you ready?

993
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,745
Are you ready?

994
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:48,368
Why are they so loud?

995
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,579
Can you hear me? Hello?

996
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,861
Hello?

997
01:02:08,737 --> 01:02:11,619
Okay! Let's count down.

998
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:13,704
- Five.
- Five.

999
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:15,175
- Four.
- Four.

1000
01:02:15,175 --> 01:02:16,759
- Three.
- Three.

1001
01:02:16,759 --> 01:02:18,175
- Two.
- Two.

1002
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:19,680
- One!
- One!

1003
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,842
Start!

1004
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:42,172
- What?
- For goodness' sake.

1005
01:02:42,617 --> 01:02:44,555
What are you doing here?

1006
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:50,907
Are you okay?

1007
01:03:19,724 --> 01:03:21,447
(Second to Last Love)

1008
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,550
It's obvious you haven't been dating
for a long time.

1009
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,443
- Min Ju!
- Who is that?

1010
01:03:25,904 --> 01:03:27,586
I thought you were on a date.

1011
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,248
I'm too old to be seeing someone.

1012
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:31,711
Why not? That's up to your heart.

1013
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:34,136
Handing over the files won't fix this!

1014
01:03:34,136 --> 01:03:35,216
Keep your voice down!

1015
01:03:35,216 --> 01:03:37,361
I can't do this anymore!

1016
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:39,135
How about having a drink with me?

1017
01:03:39,135 --> 01:03:41,603
You're the one I love

1018
01:03:43,392 --> 01:03:44,544
You spit on me.

1019
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:48,779
You must have had it tough
all by yourself.

1020
01:03:48,779 --> 01:03:50,493
What does she even know?

1021
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,925
It must have been lonely.

1022
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:54,989
Flirting back and forth like young kids,

1023
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:56,773
that's not my thing.

1024
01:03:56,773 --> 01:03:59,681
Min Ju, we're dating now, starting today.

1025
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:01,681
