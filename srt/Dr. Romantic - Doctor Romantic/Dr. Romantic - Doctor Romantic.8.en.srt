1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:02,678
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:27,820
Dr Yoon.

3
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,635
I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm truly sorry.

4
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,811
Walk in there slowly.

5
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,866
Nice and slowly.

6
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:53,296
One false move, you might get cut, girl.

7
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,667
Are you okay, Dr Yoon?

8
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,561
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,189
Who are you?

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,053
Who the heck are you to be breaking
into a hospital's OR and doing this?

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,957
Who's the boss, here?

12
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:09,129
Who's the person
with the most authority in here?

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,203
It's me.

14
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,475
If you have something to discuss,
discuss it with me.

15
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,391
What do you want?

16
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,372
If you don't stop the surgery right now,
this girl dies.

17
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,481
Hey, you!

18
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,503
Stop right there.

19
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,522
Put the phone down.

20
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:40,498
If you do anything rash,
this girl will get hurt.

21
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,734
This is an operating room.

22
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,542
It's not a place for just anyone
to be walking into like this.

23
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,885
And holding someone hostage
with a sickle just isn't right.

24
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,047
Be quiet!

25
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,897
If you don't want to see her get hurt now,

26
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:00,099
get away from that operating table
right now.

27
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,330
-Excuse me...
-Stop the operation, right now,

28
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:07,834
before I really kill her!

29
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,029
No!

30
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,945
It's the Situation Room.

31
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:13,504
An outsider with a sickle...

32
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,841
...has entered the OR at Doldam Hospital.

33
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:18,531
-Please check on the situation immediately.
-Copy.

34
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,650
Oh, I'm quite sorry about this.

35
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:22,069
You've gone through
all this trouble for nothing.

36
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:25,132
I searched the entire building
with the employees just now...

37
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,487
...and we didn't find anyone.

38
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:29,516
Did you look everywhere?
He may be hiding, like bathrooms and such?

39
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,052
We checked the ones on the first
and second floor twice over.

40
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,187
And we didn't find
anything worth mentioning.

41
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,090
Yes, go ahead.

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,731
We just received a report
from Doldam Hospital.

43
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:42,529
Oh, it looks like someone else
called in to report.

44
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,098
They said there's someone
being held hostage in the OR.

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,233
Go check, please.

46
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,125
Did you check the operating room?

47
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,053
Can't you hear me?

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,342
Stop the surgery right now!

49
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,462
Hey, Doctor.

50
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,079
Turn off all the machines over there.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,651
As for the rest of you, go over there.

52
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:03,413
Now!

53
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,918
If you don't want to see this girl die...

54
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:14,322
...turn off all the machines
when I count to three and step aside.

55
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,197
If you don't, I'll really kill her!

56
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,768
One!

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,968
Doctor.

58
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,347
Two!

59
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,969
Everyone, do as he says.

60
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:31,039
Move away from the operating table!

61
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,089
Stay in your positions, everyone.

62
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,556
Teacher Kim.

63
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,193
Don't make any movements
during an operation...

64
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,494
...without any orders from me.

65
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,140
Stay in your positions.

66
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,729
Are you really planning to just watch
Dr Yoon die in front of us?

67
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,390
Yoon Seo-Jung.

68
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,990
Answer me, Yoon Seo-Jung!

69
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,795
Yes, Doctor.

71
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,810
I won't give up on this surgery.

72
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,505
Doctor!

73
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,433
I understand.

74
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,585
Look here, Doctor.

75
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:34,536
Does it look like
I'm playing games right now?

76
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,582
Dr Nam. The patient's vitals, please.

77
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,389
They're still stable.

78
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,010
But you know, Teacher Kim...

79
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,089
Knife.

80
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,144
Teacher Kim.

81
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,156
Give me the knife!

82
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:51,607
You guys...

83
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:54,916
Do you guys even know...

84
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,873
...what kind of person he is?

85
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,015
The man lying over there...

86
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,207
...is a serial rapist! You know?

87
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,343
I worked hard to earn as much money
as I possibly could...

88
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,351
...and I was out delivering packages
until it was quite late.

89
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:21,755
And while I was out doing that...

90
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,658
...he broke into my house
where my wife and daughter were...

91
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:37,236
My wife was pregnant
with our second baby at the time.

92
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:39,912
And my daughter...

93
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,533
My daughter...

94
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,314
...was barely 11 years old.

95
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,486
That jerk, he...

96
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,568
But...

97
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,994
...do you know what his sentence was?

98
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,698
Just three years,
as if it were a minor crime!

99
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,865
But he managed to get out in two, anyway.

100
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:12,191
Because of upstanding behavior on top
of being charged with a minor crime.

101
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,242
Does that make any sense?

102
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,101
After that,

103
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,218
my wife had a miscarriage...

104
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,856
...and my daughter, Ah-rin...

105
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,932
...has to wear a colostomy bag...

106
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,163
...for the rest of her life.

107
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,903
But...

108
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,306
...he was released for good behavior!

109
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,112
How does that make any sense?

110
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,482
So?

111
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,493
You want to punish him yourself, now?

112
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,023
The laws in this lousy country
are all wrong!

113
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,511
What else am I supposed to do?

114
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,434
I have to step up, if I must.

115
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,763
I'm the head of my family, after all!

116
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,165
And yet, I can't make a living,

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,978
and I'm poor...

118
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,303
...and I have no power!

119
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,174
I may be an incompetent dad,

120
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,643
but I'm still the head of my family.

121
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,812
I have to step up...

122
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,351
...and make sure he pays for his crimes
if nobody else will do it!

123
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,393
I see.

124
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,162
I completely understand
where you're coming from.

125
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,792
Go ahead and do that then.

126
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,104
Doctor.

127
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,166
But in exchange,

128
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,599
you can't kill him
until I'm done with my surgery.

129
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,818
Look here, Doctor.

130
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,043
How could you say that
even after I told you my story?

131
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,325
It truly breaks my heart
to hear your story...

132
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,476
...but I can't give up on this patient.

133
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:17,364
I don't have the authority to do that.

134
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,933
Because I'm not a judge.

135
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,970
So if you want to make him pay
for his crimes and such,

136
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,336
do it after my surgery.

137
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,414
You'd let this girl die
just to save a man like him?

138
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,354
Is that what you're saying, Doctor?

139
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,949
What I'm saying is,

140
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,908
I'll do my part, so you do yours.

141
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,078
Darn it!

142
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,422
Knife.

143
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:51,405
Don't you dare move a muscle, any of you!

144
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,994
Give me the knife.

145
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,210
You can't, Nurse Oh.

146
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:58,672
You mustn't, no matter what.

147
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,742
Please stop it, all of you!

148
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,977
-Give me the knife, right now!
-Hey!

149
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,746
It's fine, then!

150
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,882
All of you will die together then!

151
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:37,110
I hope that you've made
the right decision, Teacher Kim.

152
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,168
You little brat!

153
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:50,923
Dr Yoon!

154
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,429
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

155
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,625
What? A hostage?

156
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,462
Yes, Chief. That's what I heard.

157
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:04,760
In the OR?

158
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:09,398
First, move the patients
who can be moved to a safer location.

159
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:12,012
And make it so that nobody
can go anywhere near the OR!

160
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,412
Okay?

161
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,386
Oh yes, is anyone injured?

162
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,843
Hey, don't operate on him!

163
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,676
You crazy man!

164
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:25,611
I said stop it! Stop!

165
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,224
I told you, stop operating on him now!
Don't do it!

166
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm begging you, please!

167
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:34,835
Just this once, please.

168
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,170
Please don't do it, Doctor!

169
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,472
Oh, you little brat!

170
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,936
-I said stop!
-Trocar.

171
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,356
You people are seriously
driving me crazy!

172
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,480
Suction.

173
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:48,949
Fine.

174
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,318
I'll give you...

175
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,787
I'll give you 30 minutes.

176
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,979
It's not that simple of a surgery.

177
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,795
We need an hour, no, at least two.

178
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,198
I don't think so.

179
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:04,757
Finish it within 30 minutes.

180
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,453
If you don't,

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,901
I won't hold back any longer, either.

182
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,371
I'm not joking. You got that?

183
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,639
Hook.

184
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:18,770
Gauze.

185
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,790
-Dr Jung.
-Yes, sir?

186
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,334
Shall we listen to some music?

187
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,783
-Pardon?
-Yes, that sounds good.

188
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,557
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,382
Open the lower part.

190
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,092
What about the patients?

191
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,051
We've moved them to a safer location.

192
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:17,197
And Mr Go is protecting the hybrid room.

193
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,132
How are things inside
of the operating room?

194
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,234
We're not sure yet.

195
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,186
I hope nothing happens.

196
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,539
I hope the doctors are all right.

197
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,903
What's the matter?

198
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,590
It's nothing.

199
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,200
Let's take care
of the shattered lamina first.

200
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,310
And focus on stopping the bleeding...

201
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,577
...after the epidural hematoma evacuation.

202
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,222
Stapler.

203
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,605
It's Chief Jang.

204
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,449
What should I do?

205
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,222
Should I pick up?

206
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,021
Maybe you should answer.

207
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:38,601
It might be something urgent.

208
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,474
You know what will happen
if you say something wrong, right?

209
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,949
Yes, Chief Jang?

210
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,437
Sutures.

211
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,744
-What?
-What is it?

212
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,879
What's going on?

213
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,707
He wants to speak with you, Mister.

214
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,633
What?

215
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:02,736
JANG GI-TAE

216
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,272
Mr Han Seung-ho. Are you listening?

217
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,141
This is Officer Lee
from Jeongseon Police Station.

218
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,508
There are police officers
surrounding the entrance of the OR.

219
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:13,573
Put your weapon down
and come outside slowly when you're ready.

220
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,766
Who was it?

221
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,603
Who reported me?

222
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,160
Nobody here reported you.

223
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,129
You know that better than anyone else,
don't you?

224
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,602
Cut. Cut.

225
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,946
Stop it! Don't move a muscle, any of you.

226
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,169
Stop the surgery right now, Doctor!

227
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,549
Cut. Cut.

228
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,122
Can't you hear me telling you
to stop the surgery?

229
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,710
I still have 6 minutes left
out of the 30 you gave me.

230
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,078
Cut.

231
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,348
-Cut.
-Stop it right now!

232
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,823
Mr Han Seung-ho!

233
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,527
Your family is currently outside.

234
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,958
They're quite worried about you, Mr Han.

235
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,024
Would you like to speak to them
on the phone?

236
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,661
You are so funny!

237
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,897
Who are you trying to fool here?

238
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,172
Dad.

239
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,375
Dad, are you there?

240
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,854
Dad, hurry and come out.

241
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,890
I'm with Mom right now...

242
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,548
...but I'm kind of scared.

243
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,271
Ah-rin...

244
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:46,806
Cut.

245
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,800
Cut.

246
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,270
Dad...

247
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,597
Doctor.

248
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:18,138
My surgery is over now.

249
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,023
It's up to you to do as you wish
from this point onward.

250
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,843
Kill him or let him live.

251
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,512
In his current state,

252
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,749
his spinal cord is severely damaged,

253
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,083
so he'll be handicapped
for the rest of his life.

254
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,470
He won't be able to walk,

255
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:37,821
and won't even be able to relieve himself
without help.

256
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,761
So he'll probably wish
that he were dead, to be honest.

257
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:46,300
But if you insist on becoming a murderer
because of a guy like him...

258
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,093
...I can't do anything about that.

259
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,956
But in exchange,

260
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,408
you'll lose many more things
that are valuable to you.

261
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,712
You'll never see your daughter
become a high schooler,

262
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,981
or a college student.

263
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:08,412
And you'll never have her beg you
to marry some pathetic excuse for a guy.

264
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,915
Be quiet.

265
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:11,013
Do you...

266
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,486
Do you really think
that'll be possible for her?

267
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:17,130
You have to protect her
so that it becomes a possibility for her.

268
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,981
In my opinion, that's the true role
of the head of one's family.

269
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,074
Be quiet!

270
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,689
Before I kill you all.

271
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,275
Okay.

272
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,582
All of us have done our part now.

273
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,307
So do whatever you please.

274
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,712
Leave, all of you.

275
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,292
What are you doing?
I told you to get out!

276
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,051
Yoon Seo-Jung.

277
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:08,847
You leave now too.

278
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,139
Is that okay with you?

279
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:22,422
Hurry up and leave
before I change my mind.

280
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:26,366
Let's leave now.

281
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,775
It's your life, so feel free to make
whichever decision suits you.

282
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,413
But I hope that you won't lose your family
because of the decision you make.

283
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,364
Teacher Kim!

284
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:02,601
Are you okay?

285
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,466
Teacher Kim.

286
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,878
Hold on.

287
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,162
Why?

288
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:16,887
Why, you little brat?

289
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,169
Why? Why? Why?

290
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,572
Why did you do that?

291
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:23,390
Why?

292
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:26,854
What did we ever do to you,
you little brat?

293
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,721
Why did you do that? Why? Why? Why?

294
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,516
What happened?

295
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,675
Has everything been resolved?

296
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,011
I don't know.

297
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,456
Dad!

298
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:20,304
Ah-rin!

299
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,494
No, Honey!

300
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:07,625
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm so sorry.

302
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,026
Ah-rin, you were scared, weren't you?

303
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,328
Daddy is sorry.

304
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,897
Daddy is fine, though. I'm okay.

305
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,131
I'm okay, Honey.

306
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,000
You know, Honey...

307
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:24,338
...make some of that beef soup
that Ah-rin really likes...

308
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,285
...and feed her a lot, okay?

309
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,189
And you too, Ah-rin.

310
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,816
Eat lots...

311
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,983
...and listen to your mother, okay?

312
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,020
If you do, Daddy will be right back.

313
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,232
Daddy's fine, okay?

314
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,063
You were scared, weren't you?

315
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,727
Did I make you scared, Honey?

316
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:50,697
Don't cry, don't cry.

317
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,915
Wait!

318
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,030
Give me your hand for a second.

319
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:34,774
I'll give you a vitamin drip on the house
next time you come by.

320
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:42,693
And thank you.

322
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:45,910
Miss Doctor.

323
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:49,514
Be sure to come back.

324
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:27,597
She's sure been through a lot
at her young age.

325
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,184
At least she has a father though.

326
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,801
She has a good father like him,

327
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,468
so she'll be able to overcome anything.

328
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,374
How are you?

329
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,447
Are you okay?

330
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:45,584
No. I was scared to death.

331
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,404
At any rate, I'm relieved.

332
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:53,768
Thanks to Teacher Kim, nobody got hurt.
Right?

333
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,574
You could've died...

334
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:57,731
...because of his arrogance.

335
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:59,359
But still, isn't it shocking?

336
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,764
How could he remain so calm
in a situation like that?

337
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:06,986
If I'd been in his shoes,
my mind would've gone blank.

338
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,702
It's one of these two.

339
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,605
He's a doctor, through and through...

340
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:14,970
...or he's a crazy man, through and through.

341
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:33,235
CHAPTER 8
An Expression of Humanism

342
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,319
Isn't it abnormal,
no matter how you think about it?

343
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,913
In a situation like that,

344
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,101
one should've stopped the surgery
and defused the situation first!

345
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:43,909
And on top of that,

346
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,672
he left a patient
who he'd operated on alone...

347
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,575
...and had everyone else leave!

348
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:52,502
You were basically telling that
sickle wielding psycho to kill him!

349
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,149
Teacher Kim already knew that
he couldn't kill the patient.

350
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,778
Isn't that right, Teacher Kim?

351
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:03,390
At any rate, just wait and see
what happens if the media finds out.

352
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:07,694
It could become a reason
to shut this place down entirely!

353
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,808
What I'm trying to say is...

354
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,768
...Dr Bu Yong-joo's approach
to defusing the situation...

355
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,960
...was way too provocative and dangerous!

356
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:27,085
A sane person would never
have considered doing such a thing!

357
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,400
That's enough out of you.

358
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,316
I'll just say two things.

359
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,452
First, he wasn't a sickle wielding psycho.

360
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,498
He's a father.

361
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:34,889
Second!

362
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,529
Stop twisting this incident
into something weird.

363
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:39,549
Closing down the hospital?

364
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,829
I dare you to say that again.

365
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:44,806
If you do that again, I'll...

366
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,317
I'll break into your room with a sickle
in my own hand, darn it.

367
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,005
I'll get going then, Director.

368
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,097
Why, that little...

369
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,369
Excuse me. I want to say something too.

370
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:01,528
Don't call him "Dr Bu Yong-joo."

371
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:03,498
He really hates being called that.

372
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,986
His fist might just go flying at you.

373
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:07,371
So be careful, okay?

374
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:08,911
Okay, then.

375
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:15,162
Goodness... Goodness me!

376
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,784
Is this a hospital run by thugs,
or something?

377
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,530
Do you know how worried I was about you?

378
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:25,706
I thought my heart was going to stop.

379
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:31,178
Did you think I'd die in the OR,
or something?

380
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,737
Look at you,
saying scary things like that again.

381
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,282
You really don't know how I feel.

382
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,632
You really, really don't know.

383
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:40,921
And that's why you got married,

384
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,253
and got a divorce.

385
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,603
Myung-shim!

386
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,162
I told you to call me by my proper name
at the hospital, Chief Jang!

387
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,681
I'm a section chief now.

388
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,219
The Section Chief of Administration.

389
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:53,560
I told you, I got a promotion.

390
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,302
I'm tired and I'd like to rest a bit.

391
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,538
Oh, would you?

392
00:28:58,905 --> 00:28:59,850
What about the unfinished work?

393
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:03,068
Tell those people
from the main hospital to do it.

394
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:04,425
I'm taking off early today.

395
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,662
She's so insensitive!

396
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,088
Doctor.

397
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:25,381
What is it?

398
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,147
I was wondering if you were okay.

399
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,338
You were quite surprised back there
in the OR, weren't you?

400
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:32,973
I'm sorry.

401
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,269
I was dragged into the OR like that,
looking like a fool.

402
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:41,279
How did you end up like this?

403
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,183
Yes, you're right.

404
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:46,854
I really have no excuses
to offer you, sir.

405
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,311
I honestly think I acted
quite pathetically back there too.

406
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:54,162
Hey, is your ability to understand
people impaired now, or something?

407
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:58,787
You were the person who was
in the most danger back there.

408
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:01,362
Why are you, of all people,
asking me if I'm okay?

409
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:02,485
Pardon?

410
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,982
Are you worrying about me,
by any chance, sir?

411
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,345
Geez. You're so foolish.

412
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,314
This is why you're doing nonclinical work.

413
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,188
even though you're a board-certified
EM doctor.

414
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,341
But that was because you told me to...

415
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:22,577
Hey, would you go and die
if I told you to?

416
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,092
I'd do the best I could
without actually dying, at the very least.

417
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:29,257
Don't laugh.
It'll make me actually like you.

418
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,673
Yes, sir.

419
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:36,870
If you develop PTSD due to that,
you'll be kicked out of this hospital.

420
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:41,094
And if you upset me again
by overdosing on drugs,

421
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,376
I'll kick you out too.

422
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,679
Keep your head on straight.

423
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:46,747
You got that?

424
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,131
Yes, of course.

425
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,210
Don't worry, sir. I'm fine.

426
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,380
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung.

427
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,582
You did well back there.

428
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,406
You withstood that well.

429
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,177
Are you, by any chance, praising me?

430
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,885
Did he just praise me?

431
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,340
PTSD?

432
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,388
Forget about what happened
in the operating room.

433
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:52,424
Let's just forget about it.

434
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,190
Let's just think about
that man's situation.

435
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:56,690
And pity him.

436
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,652
It's just that it's so weird.

437
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:00,694
What do you mean?

438
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:01,813
Teacher Kim's behavior.

439
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,175
What about Teacher Kim?

440
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,098
He didn't do the dural repair.
What do you think about that?

441
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:13,333
Well, maybe because he was short on time?

442
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,803
Maybe he thought that he wouldn't
be able to do it within the 30 minutes.

443
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,772
But still, he's not the type to skip over
a procedure that needs to be done.

444
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,978
What are you trying to say?

445
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,991
I'm wondering...

446
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,826
...if he had a change of heart
for a second back then.

447
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:48,101
He definitely was hesitating back then.

448
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:52,932
What could it have been?

449
00:32:53,594 --> 00:32:56,115
No way! There's no way.

450
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,745
You're suggesting that
he skipped a procedure...

451
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,209
...because of his personal feelings?

452
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,616
But the patient was a rapist.

453
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:04,484
And an especially terrible one, at that.

454
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,049
To be honest, I wanted to give up...

455
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:10,123
...on that surgery right then
and there after hearing that,

456
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,467
despite the Nightingale Pledge I took.

457
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,857
You think Teacher Kim didn't feel that way...

458
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,979
...just because he's Teacher Kim?

459
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:21,026
There's not even a slight chance that
he felt that way, in my opinion.

460
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:24,582
I've been with him the longest,
so I know him quite well.

461
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,856
He never lets his personal feelings
get between him and his patients.

462
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,324
If he were the type of person
to have a change of heart because of that...

463
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:33,587
...he would've given up on the surgery
when Yoon Seo-Jung was being threatened.

464
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:35,816
Why didn't he do the dural repair, then?

465
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,835
It's not that he didn't.
He probably couldn't.

466
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:41,707
And there are also cases in which
making stitches would make things worse.

467
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:45,769
Nerves have quite
a low chance of recovering too.

468
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:52,533
You really think that
it was because he couldn't?

469
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,036
And not because he chose not to?

470
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:22,930
Do you have some time tomorrow, ma'am?

471
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,000
I want to speak to you
regarding something.

472
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:30,199
So please come to the hospital
with your child tomorrow.

473
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:37,711
Your name is Ah-rin, right?

474
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,396
Yeah.

475
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:41,670
Ah-rin.

476
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:46,587
I'm really good at fixing up sick people.

477
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,122
Don't worry, Ah-rin.

478
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,358
I'll do everything...

479
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:55,662
...that I possibly can...

480
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,952
...and fix you right up.

481
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,674
Okay?

482
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:08,869
Come here.

483
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,446
Don't worry about the hospital fees, okay?

484
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:18,085
I'll take care of it for you.

485
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,595
This much is enough.

486
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:41,475
No, I'm just saying.

487
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:43,831
The cabbage is good...

488
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:47,915
so I'm sending some cabbage kimchi
and some dumplings for you.

489
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:51,081
That will be 6 dollars. Thank you.

490
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,859
Why did you go through the trouble
to send me that stuff?

491
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,771
Oh, it's nothing.
I don't do much, anyway.

492
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:00,162
I'm really good at making dumplings...

493
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:01,561
...that I can do it with my eyes closed now.

494
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,632
Yeah, okay!

495
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:09,314
Make sure you eat, okay?

496
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,605
Okay, I will.

497
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,992
SON

498
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,569
We're here, Director.

499
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:36,296
Oh. Welcome, Dr Do In-bum.

500
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,873
But Dr Kang Dong-joo isn't with you?

501
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,522
He said that he'd sleep at the hospital.

502
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:43,342
I don't know why he is so stubborn.

503
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:45,973
I'm sure you're tired.

504
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,895
Go upstairs and unpack.

505
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,489
This wing is being used.

506
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:54,376
Please choose any room
among those that you'd like.

507
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:02,799
Oh...

508
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:17,034
Hey, that hurts!

509
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,915
I know that.

510
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,725
Well, can you make it hurt less, then?

511
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,970
Hey, it's not going to hurt
any less than this.

512
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,987
Your wound opened up a lot.

513
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,049
I'll have to give you stitches.

514
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:31,091
For real? How many?

515
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,654
Well, I won't know until I do it.

516
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,656
Give me some Lidocaine
for the local anesthesia.

517
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:36,657
Yes, Doctor.

518
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,458
Make it so that it doesn't scar.

519
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,495
Hey, this is the ER,

520
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:43,230
not a plastic surgeon's office.

521
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,214
Please do it for me?

522
00:37:45,281 --> 00:37:46,667
I feel like you probably could,
if you tried.

523
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:47,704
Okay.

524
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:49,870
I'll anesthetize you now.

525
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:52,286
-Get over here!
-Wait.

526
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,083
Please.

527
00:37:56,294 --> 00:37:58,212
Wow, wow!

528
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:01,970
Why are you making
the shot hurt this much?

529
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:05,021
Mister, you're not a real doctor, are you?

530
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:07,684
Why? Do I seem like a quack to you?

531
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:08,829
Am I wrong?

532
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:14,463
Consider it an honor
that I'm the one treating you.

533
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,870
The only triple board certified surgeon
in the country.

534
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:25,883
And he was once called "The God's Hand."

535
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,107
He's no longer human.

536
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,172
In other words, he's like a psychopath.

537
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:33,213
But he's a man who is called names
like that by others.

538
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:34,378
And...

539
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,383
Please stop, all of you!

540
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,602
Stay where you are, everyone.

541
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,310
You mustn't.

542
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:42,798
I have no intention of giving up
on this surgery.

543
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:48,161
Someone who makes me
feel smaller and smaller, as a doctor.

544
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:53,206
What are you doing here?

545
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:54,968
What are you doing here, Doctor?

546
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:57,538
Can't you tell? I'm on duty.

547
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:00,741
Give him a TD shot
and send him on his way.

548
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:01,642
Yes, Doctor.

549
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,513
Man...

550
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:15,793
What?

551
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,258
Do you have something to say to me?

552
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:23,443
I almost hit you back there,
in the operating room.

553
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:28,202
Dr Seo-Jung had a blade at her neck.

554
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,264
How could you maintain
such a cold demeanor in that situation?

555
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:33,519
Who says that
I maintained a cold demeanor?

556
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,542
It appeared that way to me.

557
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:41,108
If I'd given up on that surgery back...

558
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,560
...then the situation would've gotten
a lot worse than that.

559
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:48,048
Someone would've ended up dead,
or seriously injured.

560
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:50,874
It was too chaotic back then for me
to maintain a cold demeanor or whatever.

561
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,413
I was just focused on handling
the situation...

562
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,547
...and making sure nobody got hurt.

563
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,448
Look at you, acting high and mighty again.

564
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:05,472
The specialized term for that
is "putting on airs."

565
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:09,617
A nicer way to say
it is "being romantic."

566
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:11,057
"Romantic"?

567
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:15,659
You're saying that you have
a romantic streak in you, Doctor?

568
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,152
I'm pretty much a corpse
without my romantic whims.

569
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:22,656
-Didn't you know that?
-Not at all.

570
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:24,157
Not in the slightest.

571
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:25,325
Well, figures.

572
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:27,761
I'm sure that a person like
our almighty Dr Kang Dong-joo...

573
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,945
...who's clever, makes quick calculations,
and makes rational judgments...

574
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,054
...wouldn't have an eye for things
such as romance.

575
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:34,713
Are you putting me down again?

576
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,249
Well, I'm certainly not praising you.

577
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,281
Why do you hate me so much?

578
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:41,282
Hey, I've never hated you.

579
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:46,213
I just don't care for your inferiority
complex and victim mentality is all.

580
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:50,822
And the complex
you've developed to cover that up,

581
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:54,286
no matter what it takes,

582
00:40:54,354 --> 00:40:55,661
it pisses me off a bit.

583
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:59,026
I'm doing my very best here.

584
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,931
Do you hate it that much to see me do that?

585
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,733
Hey, if you merely know
how to do something...

586
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,735
...but don't know its significance,

587
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,548
you're completely worthless as a doctor.

588
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:16,076
Oh, wake me up...

589
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,778
-...when a patient comes in, please.
-Yes, sir.

590
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:18,679
Sir!

591
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,014
Good!

592
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,350
Yeah, see you again!

593
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:24,551
All right.

594
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,920
Oh man, my knee.

595
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,357
Geez...

596
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,329
Teacher Kim doesn't leave the ER,
for the most part.

597
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:39,833
I'm sure he's slept more often
in the ER than at home.

598
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,655
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

599
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:49,743
Yes.

600
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,790
Yes, I understand.

601
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:52,729
What is it?

602
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:54,948
A drunk driving accident on Route 38.

603
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,337
They'll be here in 5 minutes.

604
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:57,238
It's fine.

605
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,302
-Don't wake him up.
-Pardon?

606
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:02,680
I'll see that patient.

607
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:41,961
Hey, there.

608
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:46,728
I have something to talk to you about.

609
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:51,505
That man.

610
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:52,640
Hey, Do In-bum!

611
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:54,575
Didn't you hear me? I want to talk!

612
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:55,976
I have nothing to discuss with you.

613
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:57,544
But I do!

614
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:59,313
I don't want to hear you out.

615
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,015
Geez, you're so cold.

616
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:04,818
Hey, it's not true.

617
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:06,223
It's not true, okay?

618
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:09,890
You and I don't share
even a single strand of DNA!

619
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:15,863
Director Do and my mother
were just friends from back in college.

620
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,321
But it did seem that...

621
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:21,201
...he had one-sided feelings
for my mom once.

622
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:25,606
But my mother already
had herself a man by then.

623
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:28,876
And that was my father.

624
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,250
Even though I don't even know
what he looked like.

625
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,795
He left my mother and ran away
before I was even born, you see.

626
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,134
You expect me to believe that?

627
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,321
Of course you should.
It's the truth, after all.

628
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:45,092
And after that, he helped my mom out
when she was facing tough times.

629
00:43:45,158 --> 00:43:46,527
Just as a friend.

630
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,396
And after Mom passed away,

631
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,899
he gave me an allowance
and paid for my tuition.

632
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,767
Just as a guardian, of course.
Nothing more.

633
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,503
If you're going to make up a story,
at least be creative.

634
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,638
I used to think that...

635
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,850
...Director Do might be my dad
at one point too.

636
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:06,446
And I desperately wished
that he were actually my dad.

637
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,116
But unfortunately,

638
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,469
there was no such plot twist in my life.

639
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,406
What's your blood type?

640
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:15,351
-B type.
-So is mine.

641
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:19,259
Hey, 27 percent of all Koreans
have that blood type!

642
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,145
Do you have any other evidence
that he's not your dad?

643
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:23,597
Did you actually do a DNA test
with my dad?

644
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,998
Why would I have to go that far?

645
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,234
I'm sure we'll find the answer
if the two of us do one.

646
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:28,408
Want to do it?

647
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:33,140
So, you'll really persist
until the very end, huh?

648
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,775
Why, are you not confident?

649
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:39,379
Wow, look at this guy, guiding me
into a world of total craziness.

650
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,321
Sure, then. Let's do it.

651
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,930
But in exchange, you pay for it.

652
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:46,920
I don't have money
to waste on things like that.

653
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:49,923
Geez, why is he so untrusting of others?

654
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:57,598
Was it you?

655
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,934
Were you the one who did that to my dad?

656
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:02,497
Huh?

657
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,380
Let go before you continue, please.

658
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:05,556
Why did you do that to him?

659
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,740
How much money
are you planning to pocket?

660
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:08,739
You gave him a CT scan, and what?

661
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:10,517
Targeted temperature management?

662
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,579
About that, Guardian.

663
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:14,248
Regarding that treatment,

664
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:16,584
a chairman of a famous
conglomerate recently...

665
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,699
Then tell that chairman to get it done
and pay tons of money.

666
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:21,722
We have no money.

667
00:45:22,477 --> 00:45:25,123
You gave him all these treatments
that insurance doesn't even cover...

668
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,944
and on top of that,
the supply fee is 1,600 dollars?

669
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:29,236
You did that, gave him a CT,
and put him in the ICU?

670
00:45:29,303 --> 00:45:30,864
You scammers.

671
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,413
Sir, calm down.

672
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,232
I already asked you to let go of me
before we continue.

673
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,773
All you doctors are just scammers.

674
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:41,569
You go and put on quite a show
just to nickel and dime us more.

675
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:42,380
Excuse me!

676
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:46,390
You've severely
misunderstood something here.

677
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:48,149
I get paid monthly here,
and don't make commission.

678
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:51,817
I don't get paid extra just because
I gave him another CT scan!

679
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:54,305
We ran all those tests because
the patient desperately needed them.

680
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:56,900
And we explained the procedures
to his guardian before running them!

681
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:59,320
I'm the guardian,
so who the heck are you talking about?

682
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:00,824
I agreed to it.

683
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,596
We have to do everything
we possibly can to try and save Father!

684
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,968
Hey, do you really think that Dad
will live just because of all this?

685
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:10,667
Didn't you see him before?

686
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,729
Can't you all see that
he's having a hard time?

687
00:46:12,796 --> 00:46:14,679
-Listen!
-Whatever!

688
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,541
Stop the treatment
you're doing on Dad right now.

689
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:22,635
Stop it right now,
before I sue you for over treatment!

690
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,152
You're overstepping your boundaries, sir!

691
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:26,420
Seo-Jung.

692
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,084
Don't get involved, Dr Yoon.
You'll just get hurt.

693
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:30,806
It's true that the patient's condition
is quite bad right now.

694
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:34,253
But you know, that doesn't mean
that he has no hope!

695
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,129
That's what I think,
based on the CT scan on his brain...

696
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,466
...shouldn't we try our best...

697
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,618
...if he has even a 1 percent chance?

698
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:45,749
That kind of talk is for people
who have the luxury for that kind of hope.

699
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,474
But we have no money.

700
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,410
We're people who live paycheck to paycheck.

701
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:52,412
But if he ends up passing away
after all this...

702
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,318
...you're basically telling us, his family,
to pay his medical bill forever.

703
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:56,814
Listen!

704
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,188
He probably won't be able
to wake up anyway!

705
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:00,159
So what's the point of forcing him
to live on like that?

706
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,720
You are such a bad son.

707
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:07,921
You cursed, wretched child!

708
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:11,300
What, am I wrong?

709
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,737
Do you have the means to repay
Dad's medical bills right away, Mom?

710
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:20,978
Your father suffered
because he worked so hard for you two,

711
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:22,566
his entire life.

712
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,779
He's on his deathbed now
and yet you can't even do this for him?

713
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:29,917
Does your father
not even have the right...

714
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:32,043
...to that kind of treatment to you?

715
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,287
Mom.

716
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,824
Yeah, that's right. We have no money.

717
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:43,430
We don't have any of that lousy money!

718
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:48,101
But still, I want to make it...

719
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,039
...so that he can open his eyes
at least one more time.

720
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:55,509
It'd be okay with me
if he opened his eyes just once.

721
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:58,545
-Your father...
-So what if he wakes up?

722
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:04,484
So what if Dad wakes up?

723
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,921
He'll probably just be lying
on a hospital bed until he dies!

724
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,038
Do you think you can do it, Mom?

725
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:14,046
Anything is possible,
as long as you're alive and breathing.

726
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:16,452
Really?

727
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,001
Fine, then.

728
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:25,116
Wow, my mom is just so cool, huh?

729
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:27,449
I'm not going to care
about this anymore then.

730
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,209
So you two do your best.

731
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:32,030
And you two take care
of the hospital bill all on your own.

732
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,383
I don't need this.

733
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:46,073
Don't worry, Mom.

734
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,692
I'll get that money, no matter what.

735
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,330
Don't worry.

736
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:00,574
So that person there is Yoon Seo-Jung?

737
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,276
Yes, that's right.

738
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:05,112
I see.

739
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,825
What about Bu Yong-joo?

740
00:49:07,892 --> 00:49:09,750
He should be in the director's office now.

741
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,096
Have things already gotten started then?

742
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:19,697
What did you just say?

743
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:25,001
We need to hear more details
about what happened in the OR yesterday.

744
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,533
To make sure that there was nothing
that went wrong with the surgery.

745
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,794
And that you didn't put the patient
in danger...

746
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,944
...while controlling the situation.

747
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,795
If it's about that,
we'll report back to you in written form.

748
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:40,067
Oh, and one more thing.

749
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:44,140
We heard that
there's a doctor here with PTSD.

750
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:53,972
And we'll investigate whether or not
you were aware of that fact, Dr Bu.

751
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:58,229
What are you talking about?

752
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,858
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung is getting
a mental evaluation?

753
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:01,768
I'm not sure.

754
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:02,936
Two investigators
and one neuropsychiatrist...

755
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:05,936
...from the main hospital
came this morning,

756
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,076
and Teacher Kim and Dr Yoon
were summoned.

757
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:32,850
Why does Dr Yoon need to get
that kind of evaluation?

758
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,891
It's something that the people
at the main hospital decided.

759
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,206
Don't ask me.

760
00:50:36,273 --> 00:50:38,418
And who's the person
who reported this to the main hospital?

761
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:40,507
What do you mean by that, Kang Dong-joo?

762
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,576
You haven't decided...

763
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,217
...to take that man Bu Yong-joo's side,
have you?

764
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:46,847
Wow,

765
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:49,453
I'm quite disappointed in you.

766
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:53,778
This has nothing to do
with taking people's sides.

767
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:56,490
You're just using Dr Yoon
to get Teacher Kim fired!

768
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:59,107
-Am I wrong?
-Get it together!

769
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,497
This isn't the time for you to be
worrying about others.

770
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,966
You should be thinking of a way
to save your own hide.

771
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:07,160
You got that?

772
00:51:12,973 --> 00:51:15,532
Have you ever had PTSD before?

773
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,145
I made a full recovery two years ago.

774
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:21,261
Oh, really?

775
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,085
What relationship
did you have with Dr Moon

776
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,722
...whom you were in an accident
with 5 years ago?

777
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,962
How did that accident happen?

778
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,531
It's your fault.

779
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,170
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

780
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:44,571
Answer me, please.

781
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,407
I died because of you.

782
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,511
Answer me.

783
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:54,448
Did you allow Dr Yoon to work here,

784
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,350
knowing that she had PTSD?

785
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:01,522
What is it that you people
really want to know?

786
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:07,294
I'm really busy, so I don't have time
for you to beat around the bush.

787
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:08,929
Just tell me
what your business with me is.

788
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:13,367
Why did Do Yoon-wan send you down here?

789
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:17,337
We're in the middle
of an investigation right now.

790
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,575
Dr Bu Yong-joo.

791
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:24,044
Mind your manners.

792
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:27,681
Is it just me,
or is it this hospital as a whole?

793
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:34,888
Wait a second.

794
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,358
It's not both, is it?

795
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:12,693
Chief.

796
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:16,930
It's "Section Chief" now.

797
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:17,898
Dr Kang Dong-joo,

798
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,566
I'm the Section Chief
of Administration now.

799
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,468
Do you know his phone number,
by any chance?

800
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,369
What?

801
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,904
Phone number?

802
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:25,272
Whose, exactly?

803
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:32,746
I was told that you slit your own wrist
not too long ago.

804
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:35,949
Can you tell me what happened, exactly?

805
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:39,987
How did it happen?

806
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:45,993
This is an important question.

807
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,127
Please answer it for me.

808
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:50,430
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

809
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:57,971
Make sure you corner her...

810
00:53:58,839 --> 00:53:59,940
...and get a confession from her.

811
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:01,575
Is that really okay with you, sir?

812
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:06,813
Pretty much everyone knows that
you're Dr Yoon's legal guardian.

813
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:10,384
And I've heard some things
from Dr Moon before, too.

814
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:16,156
There's no need to continue
feeding a dog that bites her owner.

815
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:18,792
Be as forceful as you can.

816
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,428
I don't even care...

817
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:23,597
...if she loses her medical license.

818
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,133
I'll ask you this one more time.

819
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:31,338
What happened during that incident
in which you slit your own wrist?

820
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,918
It was my mistake.

821
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:48,422
What do you mean by "mistake," exactly?

822
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:55,863
I made the wrong decision
of taking too many anti-anxiety pills.

823
00:54:56,129 --> 00:55:00,334
Each and every answer you provide
can prove to be quite important.

824
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,202
And in the worst-case scenario,

825
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:04,771
you can lose your medical license.

826
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,708
Please think carefully before answering.

827
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,177
I'm aware of that.

828
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:13,747
But...

829
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:18,218
I can't lie,

830
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,422
even if it was because I lost control
of myself for a mere moment.

831
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,393
After all...

832
00:55:28,595 --> 00:55:29,696
...I'm a doctor.

833
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:34,067
What are you doing?

834
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,069
I have nothing more to say to you,

835
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:38,372
so do whatever you people want.

836
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:39,973
If you don't comply with us,

837
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:43,110
there may be bad consequences.

838
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,748
Isn't that just what you people want though?

839
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,716
You people will just fabricate...

840
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,220
...the results to be what you want
no matter what I say or do,

841
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:56,990
whether I comply or not.

842
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,826
So stop being a nuisance,

843
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:01,495
and do whatever you want.

844
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:03,530
-Look here!
-In return,

845
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:07,000
keep it to just me, okay?

846
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:11,705
Don't do something cowardly
like getting others involved too.

847
00:56:11,772 --> 00:56:12,606
Got that?

848
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,510
As of this moment, Dr Bu Yong-joo
is hereby forbidden to practice medicine.

849
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:22,416
And this will stay in place
until I hear an acceptable explanation...

850
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,018
...regarding what happened yesterday,

851
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:29,122
and your knowledge of Dr Yoon's PTSD.

852
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,124
No objections, I presume?

853
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:34,528
You brought this upon yourself, after all.

854
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:51,011
What happened?

855
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,348
Where's Yoon Seo-Jung?

856
00:56:55,182 --> 00:56:57,050
She's being interviewed...

857
00:56:57,317 --> 00:56:59,987
...by a neuropsychiatrist
from the main hospital.

858
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:02,087
What in the world is going on here?

859
00:57:02,154 --> 00:57:06,026
What's with the investigators
and the mental evaluation?

860
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:08,827
Teacher Kim!

861
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:12,836
Oh, you're already done?

862
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,635
I heard that you were being interrogated.

863
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:17,070
I'm sure that it didn't end so soon.

864
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:19,779
See?

865
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,169
This is why you should've
just listened to me from the start.

866
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:23,744
How dare you try to do
the chairman's surgery...

867
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,012
...in your lowly position?

868
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:27,428
Look at the mess you've made.

869
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:29,196
Looks like you'll lose
another precious disciple...

870
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,289
...because of your stubbornness.

871
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:32,613
Oh, my goodness...

872
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,353
What should we do about this now?

873
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:39,801
Doctor!

874
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:45,899
You have a guest.

875
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,816
A guest?

876
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:57,377
Teacher Kim!

877
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:59,207
I'm here.

878
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:03,922
I heard you told me
to admit myself to the hospital.

879
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:08,989
I contacted the chairman...

880
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:12,464
...with the news just as you told me to, sir.

881
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:23,369
Why are you just standing there?

882
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:25,926
Hurry up and escort me to my room.

883
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:04,609
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
