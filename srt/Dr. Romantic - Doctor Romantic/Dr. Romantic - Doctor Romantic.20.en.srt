1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:02,685
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:37,371
Success in Korea's first
artificial heart transplant surgery?

3
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,679
What brings you here?

4
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,683
Isn't this the celebration party for
the artificial heart transplant surgery?

5
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,785
Then, of course, we are invited.

6
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,658
Because we made this happened.

7
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,032
What does that mean?

8
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,069
So, you want to start this with me?

9
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,204
Why?

10
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,840
Are you nervous?

11
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,312
Well, it's a little tense here.

12
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,446
Right?

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,349
It seems like they are going
to fight or something.

14
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,086
Should I call the police in advance?

15
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,921
Both of you, be quiet.

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,023
Excuse me.

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,968
For Sa-bu.

18
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,690
I only said hi.

19
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,564
I was a bit surprised, but welcome.

20
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,435
The reason you came here
by your own free will...

21
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,338
...is because you want the
acknowledgment, right?

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,041
Fine, I acknowledge.

23
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,611
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,047
What good will come from us fighting?

25
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,551
I am still
the top authority of this hospital,

26
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:35,956
and you made a comeback as
a great surgeon after those harsh years.

27
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,658
On top of that,

28
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,027
you even succeeded in completing...

29
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,462
...the chairman's artificial
heart transplant surgery.

30
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,899
With all the dramatic options,

31
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,969
all we need to do
is finish setting up, right?

32
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,909
Think wisely.

33
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,413
We need to find the way to cooperate
rather than dividing up.

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,783
Cooperate? Yeah, right.

35
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,753
Do you even know
what the word cooperate means?

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,158
Win-win situation for both of us,
like getting the chicken and the egg...

37
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,526
I'm just saying,

38
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,262
let's make sure we get our benefits.

39
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,632
Getting the chicken and the eggs,

40
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,635
isn't that the way
to extinct rather than to cooperate?

41
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,836
What did you say?

42
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,404
Well,

43
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,175
you are not the only stupid one.

44
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,445
I was also the stupid one
that neglected the truth,

45
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:35,582
so that you can be in that top authority.

46
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,585
I'm was also the same bastard.

47
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,027
Watch your mouth, Bu Yong-Joo.

48
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,129
This is a public place.

49
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,664
Up until now,

50
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,969
I thought the best way to live
was to not get mixed up with you.

51
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,808
If you keep living like that, you will
one day burst with your own greed.

52
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,877
I will not let it bother me.

53
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,146
I will just live my own life right,

54
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,348
instead of getting involved.

55
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,018
I lived by not caring and neglecting...

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,888
...all the wrongdoings that you have done.

57
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:19,626
I pretended not to hear and see
all your endless crap.

58
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,931
I pretended to not care
and kept silent all this time.

59
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,599
But...

60
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,802
...I can't do that anymore.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,043
I am not going to live like that.

62
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,947
What are you going to do instead then?

63
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,521
For now,

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,226
that the day that I made
the wrong decision 14 years ago.

65
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,530
Let's start from that day.

66
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:20,187
Do you think you can keep me at bay
with something with no legality?

67
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:24,858
Wouldn't this at least hurt you
from becoming the next hospital director?

68
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,728
Whether it's morally or ethically...

69
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,820
Why?

70
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,073
Are you scared now?

71
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,054
Trauma-centered medical center.

72
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,891
Will that do?

73
00:05:59,026 --> 00:05:59,893
What?

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,728
If I become the next hospital director,

75
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:07,067
I will positively review in making
Doldam Trauma-Centered Medical Center.

76
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,605
By gathering all my resources
to get some governmental supports too.

77
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,775
Are you even listening to me?

78
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,846
Are you trying to get out of this?

79
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,914
Isn't this what you wanted?

80
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,382
That is why
you are threatening me right now.

81
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:27,451
Wow, you make me such a humorous man.

82
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,559
Do you know what the kids these days...

83
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,829
...say to punks like you?

84
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,731
No-answer.

85
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,733
There is no answer for you.

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,636
Then tell me what you want!

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,309
Tell me the right answer
you want me to say.

88
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,446
Just...

89
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,083
...shut up and quietly...

90
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,818
...step down!

91
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,694
Don't stay up there like this...

92
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,631
...and clean up your own mess.

93
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:16,711
Got it?

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,534
The artificial heart transplant procedure
was truly great.

95
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,435
I admire you.

96
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,270
Are you coming back to
the main hospital now?

97
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,872
Sir, just a picture please?

98
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,515
You persistent punk,

99
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,404
You're going to bring me down to the end?

100
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,441
This is why justice prevails, you idiot!

101
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,942
What did you say!

102
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,382
Teacher! Teacher!

103
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,818
Father, Father!

104
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,958
Teacher! Teacher!

105
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,565
Teacher. Teacher.

106
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,882
What brings you here?

107
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,751
Oh! Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

108
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,754
- Doctor Nam.
- It's been a long time.

109
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,157
- Doctor Kang is here too.
- Yes.

110
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,259
Is someone not feeling well?

111
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,394
He is the Chief Surgeon
in our Doldam Hospital.

112
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,331
He hurt his head and hand
at the reception we attended today.

113
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,432
Oh, I see.

114
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,566
This way.

115
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,141
Wait, we will take it from here.

116
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,646
Oh, I forgot this isn't our hospital.

117
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,819
Doctor Yoon Seo-Jung?

118
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,089
Dr Lee, long time no see.

119
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,690
What brings you here?

120
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,693
Well...

121
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,863
...this is Dr Bu Yong-Joo.

122
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,466
While we were at the reception,

123
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,469
he hurt his head and hand
because the ice statue fell on him.

124
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,004
Let's take a look.

125
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,040
There seems to be only
a slight hit on the head,

126
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,109
so let's take the wrist x-ray first.

127
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,213
Do you recognize him?

128
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,383
He is Dr Kang Dong-Joo,
who was here a few months ago at ED.

129
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,251
I think I have heard of him before.

130
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,154
About two classes below me, I think.

131
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,025
Let's try taking the x-ray first.

132
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,193
Okay, on our way.

133
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,395
Nurse Nam, x-ray first.

134
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,429
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:51,103
Director, why don't you take
an x-ray on the shoulder you fell on,

136
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,213
and get a CT scan on your head?

137
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,549
It's okay, just do the treatment.

138
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,618
Yes, sir.

139
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,863
- It's fine, just get out.
- But, it's bleeding, Director.

140
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,698
Forget it, just get out!

141
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,271
Please step outside.

142
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,756
Give me your hand.

143
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,939
I will disinfect first.

144
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:06,053
Teacher.

145
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,155
Are you okay? Are you back now?

146
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,289
Teacher.

147
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,291
Where are we?

148
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,228
We came down to
Geosan University's main hospital ER.

149
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,964
You got hurt
because the ice statue fell on you.

150
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,736
It is swollen a lot so we put
some ice pack on.

151
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,643
I have the x-ray result.

152
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,470
- How did it come out?
- How did it come out?

153
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:35,516
You guys.

154
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,585
Please step outside.

155
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,053
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

156
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,989
I can listen to the result.

157
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,524
Get out.

158
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,594
Go.

159
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,697
How did it go? How's Teacher Kim?

160
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,967
The result came just now
but he wanted to hear it alone.

161
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,936
But still, why did you guys step out?

162
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,971
You should have listened
to the results with him.

163
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,908
We wanted to do that,

164
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,410
but he was so stubborn.

165
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,381
I think it will take some time,

166
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,484
so three of you can go and
have some dinner near here.

167
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,854
- Should we?
- Food?

168
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,024
We have a person with injury
and you want food?

169
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,370
He doesn't look well.

170
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,607
Is the result not good?

171
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,917
- Excuse me, Doctor Yoon.
- Yes.

172
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,025
Nurse Jin.

173
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,608
I think you came with Dr Kang Dong-Joo...

174
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,842
Yes.

175
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,311
We are working together
at Doldam Hospital.

176
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,647
I see.

177
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:17,117
Ever since you disappeared
after that accident five years ago,

178
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:21,054
I was always curious
and wondered how you've been.

179
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,592
I...

180
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,764
...have been doing better than I thought.

181
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:38,038
I met good people and a good teacher
at a good hospital.

182
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,875
And you got together with
Dr Kang Dong-Joo, right?

183
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,780
We, all the ED nurses knew, you know.

184
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:51,451
That Dr Kang liked Dr Yoon a lot,
since five years ago.

185
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,954
Is that so?

186
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:58,592
Oh, ER Call.

187
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,696
He must be your son...

188
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,566
Yes...

189
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,103
...he is five this year.

190
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,275
He looks like his father a lot.

191
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,413
He must be really cute now,
since he is 5-year-old.

192
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,786
Stay happy.

193
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:32,893
Yes.

194
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,329
You too, Nurse Jin.

195
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,332
Yes.

196
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,782
Come back to the main hospital.

197
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:58,886
In any case,

198
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,358
you probably learned a lot by
participating...

199
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,693
...in this artificial
heart transplant surgery.

200
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,296
You have done enough.

201
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,132
- Come back.
- I think...

202
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:18,038
...I am lucky to be your son.

203
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:25,145
I was proud to be known as your son
than just by my name.

204
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,119
Your name was my own qualification.

205
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:39,126
But as I got to Doldam Hospital,

206
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,596
I was called by my own name more
than as your son, for the first time.

207
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:51,972
First, I was confused and felt annoyed.

208
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,112
Your name did not work anywhere there.

209
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,655
But Father...

210
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,895
For the first time,

211
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,599
I saw who I really was.

212
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,304
Without you,

213
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,903
my life was just this much...

214
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,844
...just like that.

215
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,684
What is it that you want to say?

216
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,830
For the time being,

217
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,600
I want to be called by my name as I live.

218
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,309
Not as your son,

219
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:00,383
but as me.

220
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,411
As Do In-bum.

221
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:09,383
Are you saying that you want
to stay at Doldam?

222
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,018
Yes, Father.

223
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,153
Stop your nonsense,
and come back here now.

224
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,889
No.

225
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,991
I won't.

226
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,268
Are you...

227
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,906
...disobeying my words,

228
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,444
your father's words?

229
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,115
From now on,

230
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,744
I just want to make my own decisions,

231
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,589
Father.

232
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,888
Have anti-inflammatory medicine
prescribed and take it.

233
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,704
You come back here right now!

234
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,578
Hey, Do In-bum!

235
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,348
Do In-bum!

236
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,622
This is a very unexpected combination.

237
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,725
Beer and pizza are very good together.

238
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,694
Yeah right...

239
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,663
Don't worry too much about Teacher Kim.

240
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,498
Worrying does not change the situation.

241
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,734
How can I not worry
when a surgeon injured his wrist?

242
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,772
How bad can it be?

243
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,107
Enough worrying and help yourself.

244
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,609
That's what I meant.

245
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,244
Stay positive, okay?

246
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,048
At our age, we can't skip meals.

247
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,983
If you get low on sugar and lose energy,

248
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,018
you'll become
more sensitive and frustrated.

249
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,286
Try this.

250
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,921
It's really good.

251
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,396
By the way, it's taking some time.

252
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,833
I know, is he injured more than we think?

253
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,512
How is he?

254
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,480
They are still talking.

255
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,649
Is he not well?

256
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:57,084
Yeah?

257
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,292
Did you see that?

258
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,627
It says neurosurgery.

259
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,694
Yes, I saw it.

260
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,062
Did you see orthopedics too?

261
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,497
Yes, I saw it.

262
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,699
Why did two departments all come down?

263
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,568
Is he seriously injured?

264
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,103
No, I doubt it.

265
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,372
It should have been just a mild wound.

266
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:21,842
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

267
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,580
How's Teacher?

268
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,448
Is his wrist okay?

269
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,150
Ask him directly.

270
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:34,788
I can't tell you anything
about the patient myself.

271
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,753
What patient is here this early morning?

272
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,857
He came to the ER
and keeps looking for Teacher Kim.

273
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:12,025
Saying that he is a singer.

274
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,126
Singer?

275
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:16,496
He said he is Nam Jin, or something.

276
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,598
Nam Jin?

277
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,236
Nam Jin is at our hospital?

278
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,006
Who is Nam Jin?

279
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,408
Well, I have no idea either.

280
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,245
How can I help you?

281
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:34,081
By any chance, are you Teacher Kim?

282
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,449
No, I'm not but,

283
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,684
we're on a similar level as an ER doctor.

284
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,521
Where is he injured? Shall I take a look?

285
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,991
Since he is a bit shy,

286
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,226
he needs to see Teacher Kim only.

287
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,562
You see, I can treat the patient
just as well as Teacher Kim.

288
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,130
Let me take a look.

289
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,666
We will wait until Teacher Kim comes.

290
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:53,967
By the way,

291
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,702
is he really Nam Jin?

292
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,373
Nam Jin?

293
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,208
Nam Jin is at our hospital?

294
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,115
Yes.

295
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,211
He is only looking for Teacher Kim.

296
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,846
Did he come to work?

297
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,049
This is Teacher Kim.

298
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,384
Can we see the patient now?

299
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,019
Oh, I see.

300
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,956
Please take a good care of our brother.

301
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,090
Brother.

302
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,426
Teacher Kim is here for you.

303
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,669
You said he was Nam Jin...

304
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,871
I am similar...

305
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:35,409
His name is Num Jin,
who sings and mimics Nam Jin.

306
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:39,246
Few days ago, the symptoms came back
while he was performing at the casino...

307
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,647
Wow,

308
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:44,451
the famous Teacher Kim is here.

309
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:49,656
Ow, I got this pain again,

310
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:54,094
so I can't sit properly now.

311
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,028
It's killing me.

312
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,396
So, what's wrong?

313
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:57,631
Where does it hurt?

314
00:24:57,698 --> 00:24:58,665
Goodness!

315
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,902
Look at how I'm sitting.
What do you think?

316
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,137
It's hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids!

317
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,809
How long has it been?

318
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:09,943
Brother, how long?

319
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,079
About 2-3 years..

320
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:13,981
No, not you.

321
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,885
This man looks bad with jaundice.

322
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:18,852
Me?

323
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,221
Are you talking about me?

324
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:24,458
He was always yellow.

325
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,492
Born that way...

326
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,530
Have you been dealing with
fatigue, lately?

327
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:34,234
The work we do is really tiring,
which causes bad fatigue anyway.

328
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,069
Excuse me.

329
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,704
Look up please.

330
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,881
When did you have your last meal?

331
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:45,542
Last night, I had bread and milk.
That is all.

332
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,880
This stupid guy.

333
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:49,917
Are you yellow because
you only had the banana milk?

334
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,886
Did you eat any other food?

335
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,721
Only water.

336
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,693
I was out of my mind because brother said
he was not feeling well since morning.

337
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,694
Nurse Oh.

338
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:07,868
Please have the blood test for him
as well as EKG and abdomen CT.

339
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,203
Okay.

340
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:10,109
Me?

341
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,772
I'm good, just check on my brother...

342
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,873
No.

343
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,577
For now, we will check
the blood test and then talk later.

344
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,779
- And Manager Song?
- Yes.

345
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:22,850
You take care of this Nam Jin guy.

346
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,917
Wait...

347
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,886
Num Jin, right?

348
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,822
I'm so annoyed.

349
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,291
Are you serious...

350
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,993
Okay, this way, sir.

351
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,061
Oh, yes.

352
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,363
I'll be back, Brother.

353
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,534
Please...

354
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,970
Look at this...

355
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:43,876
Yes.

356
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,317
What are you up to?

357
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,921
What are you scribbling
since early morning?

358
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,323
I am drawing.

359
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,591
Drawing?

360
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:11,098
Yes, I am actually a webtoon writer.

361
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,903
I want to draw more
when I still have the energy to do it.

362
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,509
Since I don't know when I'll die,

363
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:28,415
I won't know which one
would be my final piece.

364
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:38,025
Chairman, are you up?

365
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,327
- Yes.
- How are you feeling today?

366
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:41,428
Oh,

367
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,096
very good.

368
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:44,398
I feel well rested.

369
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,134
We will move you to a general room today.

370
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,068
Really?

371
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,070
Wow,

372
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:51,939
that's good to hear.

373
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:54,447
Yes.

374
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,612
Anyway,

375
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,885
Is that young man waiting for
a heart transplant surgery too?

376
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,090
Yes...

377
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,193
But not at this moment.

378
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,194
Why not?

379
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,872
Most of the patients who come with
expansive myocardial infarction,

380
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:20,400
and heart failure usually have
pulmonary artery with high blood pressure.

381
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,568
In this case,

382
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:25,072
there is a high possibility
in failing the procedure,

383
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:27,774
so we need to install LVAD to decrease
the high pressure in the pulmonary artery.

384
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:30,477
Then, you should do that for him.

385
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,279
Why is he still lying there?

386
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,315
The procedure is extremely expensive.

387
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:41,355
It's not a surgery that anyone
can afford or get like you did.

388
00:28:57,638 --> 00:28:59,718
I think the patient is
getting a side effect, Doctor.

389
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,576
- What did you just inject?
- I injected the Diclofenac.

390
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,978
I can't breathe well, Doctor.

391
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:08,176
For now, start on full drop hydration
of odmaster 7L,

392
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,587
and check the vital signs for me.

393
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:11,428
BP is at 60/100 and heart rate is at 110.

394
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,053
Take a deep breath.

395
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,956
Give her Ampi 0.3 mL intramuscular,

396
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,858
and then give her Pheniramine 1 amp,
and Dexa 1 amp.

397
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,759
What is going on?

398
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,160
It seems like side effects
from Diclofenac.

399
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,228
Is it anaphylaxis?

400
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:24,498
She is not in shock yet,
but has difficulty breathing.

401
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:27,167
Miss, open your mouth please.

402
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:31,271
Let's get intubation ready, just in case.

403
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:32,172
Okay.

404
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,608
Wow, this could've been bad.

405
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,717
Were you the one who
treated that patient?

406
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,347
Oh, it was me.

407
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:42,616
Did you check her allergies,
Doctor Woo Yeon-hwa?

408
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:43,917
Allergy?

409
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,119
Yes. I think so.

410
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,888
What do you mean you think?

411
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,957
If you did, you did.
If not, then you didn't.

412
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,796
Do you have any allergies
or side-effects?

413
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,664
No, I don't.

414
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:00,067
I don't even catch a cold that much.

415
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,468
Oh, I did check.

416
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,536
Are you sure?

417
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:06,073
Yes, the patient said that
she does not have any.

418
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,075
Then, why didn't you put it on the chart?

419
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:11,011
I was about to do it now...

420
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:14,615
...I told her to do something,
Doctor In-bum.

421
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:18,886
How can you be a doctor
without knowing the basics?

422
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:23,524
You should have recorded in
the chart right after you saw the patient.

423
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,026
You weren't even sure
about what you just checked.

424
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:29,329
She is more confused
because you keep yelling at her.

425
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,308
Stop it, In-bum.

426
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,310
Please stop.

427
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,189
What do you think?

428
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,049
Is it the pancreas head cancer?

429
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:51,116
What about the operative options
in this situation?

430
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,086
Is it Whipple's Operation?

431
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,154
Yes.

432
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,591
Excision from the head of the pancreas,

433
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:01,028
biliary tract, gall bladder, duodenum...
all at once.

434
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,730
This is the beauty of
the general surgeon.

435
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,599
Do you have any experience with it?

436
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,435
I have assisted a few times,
before I passed the board.

437
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,371
Do you want to try?

438
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,875
Me?

439
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:15,782
Yes.

440
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:19,746
How about you?

441
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:23,517
It will take about two to three weeks
for my wrist to get healed.

442
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:27,721
No, it can possibly take
longer than that.

443
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,358
You will know when you get
the blood test result,

444
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,393
but the liver level is too high.

445
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:36,096
Yes, it's over 10.

446
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:40,033
This is not a situation where
we can delay it for a week.

447
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,836
I will guide you through it for now,

448
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,638
but do you want to try?

449
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,306
Or should I give it to Do In-bum?

450
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,775
I will do it.

451
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:50,544
Okay.

452
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,347
I will give you three days to prepare.

453
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,154
- Dismissed.
- Yes.

454
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,633
About Teacher Kim.

455
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:16,570
Don't you think he is hiding something?

456
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,205
Hiding what?

457
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,009
He said it's a simple contusion,

458
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,479
but I think his injury seems to be worse.

459
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,183
You think so?

460
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,269
I will do it, Teacher Kim.

461
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,204
Alright.

462
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,272
You wanted to check this, right?

463
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,343
Did Chairman move down
to the general patient room?

464
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,678
Yes, he did.

465
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,879
Okay.

466
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,581
For the time being,

467
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,484
don't forget to check
the Chairman's condition time to time.

468
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,986
Yes, sir.

469
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,490
But, Teacher...

470
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:11,792
Next page, please.

471
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:13,827
Yes.

472
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:19,533
How did it go with patient
Jung Jin-young's infection?

473
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:24,505
It has not reduced quite well because
the tube was there for a long time.

474
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:28,108
We barely caught the fever that
went up to 38 Celsius yesterday.

475
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,610
Oh, I see.

476
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:33,881
But, Teacher Kim.

477
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:35,582
It's okay.

478
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:42,956
You have only been staring
at my wrist this whole time.

479
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,592
It's fine.

480
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:51,431
Can't you tell me how badly
you are injured?

481
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,033
No.

482
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,268
Teacher Kim.

483
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:58,105
When I say I'm fine, I really am fine.

484
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,706
Got it?

485
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:04,111
Would it be okay?

486
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:08,549
Will my hand... really be okay,
Teacher Kim?

487
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:12,019
According to the x-ray,
the bones reattached well.

488
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,454
So, with good rehabilitation...

489
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:18,725
I can continue to practice
medicine, right?

490
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:22,029
Am I okay for sure?

491
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:25,365
If I say it's fine, it really is fine.

492
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,136
Let's see...

493
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,945
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:41,481
It's fine, take it easy.

495
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,150
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,618
I am so sorry, Teacher Kim.

497
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,453
It's okay, don't worry.

498
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,689
It's alright.

499
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,943
It's fine, okay?

500
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,680
Yes, I understand.

501
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:17,251
Okay, you are good to go.

502
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:18,919
Yes, Teacher.

503
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:28,262
Teacher.

504
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,168
What?

505
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:35,235
Can I work with you in the hospital
when I pass my EM board license?

506
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,005
Hey, let's talk after you pass.

507
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:42,976
I passed.

508
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:50,083
EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN
CERTIFIED LICENSE

509
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,920
Now I can work with you
at Doldam Hospital, right?

510
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:58,225
By the way, Teacher,

511
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:01,495
I would like to try for two boards too.

512
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:02,996
- Cut.
- Yes, cut.

513
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:07,601
Should I go for general surgery
or cardiothoracic surgery?

514
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,137
- Cut.
- Yes, cut.

515
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:14,241
Stop with your gibberish,
and do your job.

516
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,376
Finish it up.

517
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,445
Yes, I will.

518
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:24,184
But, cardiothoracic surgery
would be better, right Teacher?

519
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:26,520
Don't get distracted.

520
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:28,622
Yes.

521
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,127
I will go for cardiothoracic surgery.

522
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,972
Why are you doing this everytime?

523
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,408
You're always rude to her
in front of all the patients.

524
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,377
Do you think I do that for no reason?

525
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:53,213
Can't I say something like that
to a junior doctor?

526
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,083
If you were going to scold her,
you should have called her outside.

527
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:57,050
Wow.

528
00:36:57,117 --> 00:36:59,119
You are talking rudely even to doctors.

529
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:01,788
Of course, I can talk like that to
doctors too, if I feel like it.

530
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:02,956
What did you say?

531
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,358
Nurse Eun-tak, stop.

532
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:07,094
What are you two doing?
Are you guys fighting?

533
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,230
Are you arguing with him,
Nurse Eun-tak? Why?

534
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:11,665
What's going on here again?

535
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:15,569
How can I see the patients when Nurse
Eun-tak keeps on watching me like that?

536
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:18,805
I have to be careful when scolding
a junior doctor for their wrongdoing,

537
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,340
and she doesn't respond
when I give her orders,

538
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,643
and even talking back to me so rudely!

539
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:23,644
You did that?

540
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,014
He keeps on yelling
and making her feel embarrassed!

541
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,981
Do In-bum, you did that?

542
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:31,118
Did you yell at Nurse Eun-tak,
and make him feel embarrassed?

543
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,554
Look here, I did that to Nurse Yeon-hwa.

544
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,055
Did I do that to you?

545
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,390
To Nurse Yeon-hwa?

546
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:41,361
Why do you care if I scold her
or yell at her?

547
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,565
Are you her older brother?

548
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,652
Or even her boyfriend?

549
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,419
What are you doing right now?

550
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,486
What did I do?

551
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:09,149
There is no reason for them to
fight harshly like that.

552
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,209
But seeing them fighting like that...

553
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,229
Do you think there is something going on
between them, Nurse Oh?

554
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,730
I know...

555
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,366
What could it possibly be?

556
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,034
I'm sorry.

557
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,503
By any chance,

558
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,004
do you like Dr Woo Yeon-hwa?

559
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,572
What?

560
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,740
What?

561
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,343
No, it's not like that.

562
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,979
Nurse Eun-tak and I are not like that.

563
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:35,048
Then, why would Nurse Eun-tak
be so mad about that,

564
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,650
and start a fight with Do In-bum?

565
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:39,486
Isn't it strange?

566
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:40,621
Well...

567
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:43,257
I'm not sure...

568
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:47,227
Do you have interest in Doctor Do In-bum?

569
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:48,562
Wow!

570
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:50,364
Could it be that...

571
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,832
...you guys are in a love triangle?

572
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,133
Oh my...

573
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,535
Why don't you write a book or something?

574
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:58,739
Why are you acting so messed up
to Dr Woo Yeon-hwa?

575
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:02,910
I act like that to you and
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung too, don't I?

576
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,479
Being messed up is my character,
so I can't do much about it.

577
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:07,514
That's my personality.

578
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:11,618
So, you absolutely don't have
any feelings for her?

579
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,127
Nope, never.

580
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,786
She is not my style.

581
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,591
No, it's nothing like that.

582
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,193
Are you sure?

583
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:20,694
It's nothing.

584
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,364
To be honest,

585
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:28,936
I have someone else that I like...

586
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:31,104
Someone else?

587
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:32,072
- Who?
- Who?

588
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,611
It's a bit surprising to know that
you have an ideal girl in mind.

589
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,047
So, who is it?

590
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,016
You will be surprised...

591
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:46,553
Dude, who is it?

592
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:49,923
Yoon Seo-Jung.

593
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,226
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

594
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,939
I see...

595
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,209
Are you serious?

596
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,044
Are you out of your mind?

597
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,651
Seo-Jung, I need to talk to you.

598
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,586
Yeah, I need to talk to you, too.

599
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:31,265
I found out who Do In-bum likes.

600
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,100
Who is it?

601
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,902
You.

602
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,838
Isn't he out of his mind?

603
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:43,010
I also found out who
Woo Yeon-hwa likes, too.

604
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,144
Who is it?

605
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,213
Is it In-bum? Is it Nurse Eun-tak?

606
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,181
You.

607
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,316
Me?

608
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:56,857
By any chance,

609
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:59,226
will this be a problem for us?

610
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,397
No, not at all.

611
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,166
- What about you?
- Absolutely not.

612
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,401
Never.

613
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,069
Good then.

614
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,804
I'm going to go now.

615
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,406
Yoon Seo-Jung.

616
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,407
What?

617
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,779
I love you.

618
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,649
Okay.

619
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,271
Director.

620
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,920
Wow.

621
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,222
All the levels are good, Mr Chairman.

622
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,159
You will be able to walk out of here
by next week.

623
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:10,964
I heard you and Director Do
got into a fight.

624
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,169
Is that how you hurt your hand?

625
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:17,371
The news travels very fast.

626
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:22,342
Is it that hard to get rid of those
harsh feelings against Director Do?

627
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:27,181
You guys are all grown men,
but you guys are still fighting?

628
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:30,484
This isn't about personal feelings,
Mr Chairman.

629
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:34,288
This is about what's right and wrong.

630
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:38,358
So, you're saying that you are right
and he is wrong?

631
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:42,396
It's not about who is wrong or right,

632
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:49,169
but there are some things that
a physician should and should not do.

633
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,709
Mr Chairman, Director Do is here.

634
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,182
What brings you here?

635
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:05,018
I need to discuss something
with you urgently.

636
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,422
Mr Chairman, I will be leaving now.

637
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:09,489
Alright.

638
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:17,798
What is it?

639
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,270
Why?

640
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:25,138
Please save me this one time,
Mr Chairman.

641
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,774
You know more than anyone,

642
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,443
how much I sacrificed for
this main hospital.

643
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,678
You know this better than anyone.

644
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:37,851
Above all else, I was the most devoted
to you and your company.

645
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,220
Look here, Director Do.

646
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,355
This is unfair.

647
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,357
The list of the substitute surgeons
that Bu Yong-joo showed you...

648
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:45,292
...cannot be proved as the truth,

649
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,961
as well as have any legal power.

650
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:51,767
Whatever he said to you is a lie.

651
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:58,131
Everything is assumptions
and lies, Mr Chairman.

652
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,706
Hey, look at me.

653
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,777
Teacher Kim did not say anything to me.

654
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,016
What are you talking about?

655
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,618
What is the list of
the substitute surgeons,

656
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:14,221
and what is legal power about?

657
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:20,227
Did you do something illegal?

658
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:24,865
Tell me right now!

659
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:43,417
Cheers for our Doldam Hospital!

660
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:45,152
Cheers!

661
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:51,024
Wow, it's refreshing!

662
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,334
Everyone, attention please. Attention!

663
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:01,263
Today is a historical day for
our Doldam Hospital.

664
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,937
Let us celebrate the successful
artificial heart transplant surgery,

665
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:07,608
and our Doldam's tremendous
development in the future.

666
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:11,712
So everyone, please help yourself
and enjoy as much as you can.

667
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,649
Is this okay, Director?

668
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,817
Yes, that's perfect.

669
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,921
That's what I meant.

670
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,625
Now,

671
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:28,795
let's stay healthy and
work together well this year.

672
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:30,731
Cheers for everyone!

673
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:33,000
Cheers!

674
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,136
Here comes the stew.

675
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,275
When did you prepare all of this?

676
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:43,343
Chicken, spicy sea snails,
and even pigs' feet.

677
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,245
I made the Kimchi stew,

678
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:49,082
but I ordered sea snails, chicken,
and pigs' feet from a restaurant.

679
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,151
So, it should be delicious.

680
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:53,654
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

681
00:45:56,523 --> 00:46:00,427
I brought digestive meds
so let me know if anyone needs them.

682
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:05,199
And, I prepared this for you ladies.

683
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,533
Dr Yoon.

684
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,001
For you to be prettier.

685
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,904
Thank you, Manager Jang.

686
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,207
No worries.

687
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:16,810
I don't see Teacher Kim.

688
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,545
Is he not coming today?

689
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:22,516
Oh right, Teacher.

690
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:35,028
Call me if there is an emergency patient.

691
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:36,430
Yes sir.

692
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,146
You really got me this time.

693
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,520
Right?

694
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,251
Just tell me the reason.

695
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,420
Why are you living like this?

696
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,190
With your skills,

697
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,427
working at this rural area and
this unprofitable trauma center...

698
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:16,937
Hey, Director Do.

699
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,945
Do you know how many patients die
on their way to the hospital?

700
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:29,449
Also, did you know that
most of those people...

701
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:31,652
...are in lower class, poverty level?

702
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:32,853
So, what?

703
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:37,858
What would change by having
a trauma center here?

704
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:42,663
There wouldn't be any patients dying on
the way to the the hospital,

705
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:45,499
even if they have to travel
an hour to get to Doldam.

706
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:48,035
Hopefully, there wouldn't be
any situations like that.

707
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:50,304
The purpose is good,

708
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,441
but it wouldn't make a difference just by
having that one purpose alone.

709
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:57,578
You are doing this to change the world?

710
00:47:57,778 --> 00:47:58,946
Not me.

711
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,681
What?

712
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:06,687
I am doing this solely to save
people's lives.

713
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:11,959
In their last moments before dying,
I am their last resort.

714
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:14,995
If I step out, the person will die.

715
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:22,236
If I do my best and not give up,
that person will live.

716
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,071
You are crazy.

717
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:29,710
You are still having that
unrealistic dream even at that age.

718
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:35,115
In a better word, I am agonizing myself.

719
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:38,619
Well, the best way to describe that is...

720
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:42,022
I am a romantic.

721
00:48:42,556 --> 00:48:43,857
Romantic.

722
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,761
Romantic...

723
00:48:50,163 --> 00:48:53,166
How many doctors would
support your nonsense?

724
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,036
How many doctors will stay
at this hospital...

725
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:58,739
...with endless work and low pay?

726
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:02,509
I want to believe it.

727
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:07,548
That there are more people
who want to be a physician...

728
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:10,884
...than to be a doctor-businessman.

729
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,253
There are a lot more students
who want that.

730
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:23,530
Oh, including In-bum.

731
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,879
A Rule to stay Romantic.

732
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:46,453
Now, everybody stay calm,

733
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,522
and I will sing for you guys.

734
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:50,591
Dr Yoon!

735
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:52,092
Good.

736
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:03,637
Most people know that it exists,

737
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:06,440
but don't believe that it does...

738
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:12,846
The beautiful values that
someone wishes to protect.

739
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:20,754
Usually, one who can play well,
can work well, also.

740
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:22,155
I guess so...

741
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,725
By the way, it's really quiet today.

742
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:27,427
I was worried that
we would've gotten urgent calls.

743
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:30,430
Don't jinx it.

744
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,808
Yes, this is Myung-shim speaking.

745
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:47,481
Yes, got it.

746
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,920
A bus rolled over on the 36 Highway.

747
00:50:53,587 --> 00:50:56,990
The bus caught on fire, so we
are expecting more than 10 patients.

748
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:20,447
Are you going too, Director?

749
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:22,382
Gosh...

750
00:52:03,991 --> 00:52:05,225
Attention.

751
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:09,062
Total of six patients will be coming
to our Doldam Hospital.

752
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,031
Two of those are with burn injuries,

753
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:12,666
and the rest are expected to have...

754
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:15,573
...multiple dislocations,
intestinal damages, and more.

755
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:19,006
Everyone stay alert, alright?

756
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:20,507
Yes, sir.

757
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:55,475
Living is like facing new roads,
every single day.

758
00:52:57,044 --> 00:52:59,079
Whether you want it or not,

759
00:52:59,546 --> 00:53:03,350
you face the reality
that comes every day.

760
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,320
Patients are coming.

761
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,366
We can't find the answer every time,

762
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:24,538
but Teacher Kim always said this.

763
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:31,945
Don't give up asking questions on
what we are living for.

764
00:53:33,013 --> 00:53:35,682
When you give up asking questions,

765
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:39,853
our romance in saving people is gone.

766
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,555
Got it?

767
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:45,659
That's what Teacher Kim said.

768
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:15,422
Mr Jung Jin-young?

769
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,758
Who are you?

770
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:21,995
A sponsor who would like to buy
your talent has sent me.

771
00:54:22,062 --> 00:54:22,896
Pardon?

772
00:54:22,963 --> 00:54:26,633
He wants to buy my talent?

773
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,636
Instead of paying for your drawings,

774
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:34,575
he would like to support you
for your LVAD procedure cost.

775
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:35,809
Then...

776
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:41,248
...will I be able to live?

777
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:43,650
If the procedure is successful.

778
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,361
Long time ago...

779
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:29,897
About 20 years ago...

780
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:36,470
There was once a wealthy person
at Namdaemoon area,

781
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:39,106
who was known to have
the most cash in Korea.

782
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,145
He was known to be
Mr Scrooge of Namdaemoon,

783
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:48,949
as he was inhumane without any mercy.

784
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:55,155
Those who wish to borrow money from him
and those who borrowed from him...

785
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:58,125
Everyone hated him...

786
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,896
He only knew about money, money, money...

787
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:06,133
A man who only knew about money.

788
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,002
But one day,

789
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:12,606
he was arguing to get
his money back as usual,

790
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:16,844
when he fainted on the street with
a heart problem.

791
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,717
But, no one tried to help him.

792
00:56:26,854 --> 00:56:28,655
Except for one.

793
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:33,594
There was one righteous man,
who was walking by that street.

794
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:45,572
Dr Teacher Kim,
do you remember who that was?

795
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,081
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
TRAUMA CENTER INSTALLMENT PROGRAM

796
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:22,776
I really like the sunlight...

797
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:18,158
Hi.

798
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:24,431
Long time no see.

799
00:59:57,262 --> 01:00:03,068
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
