1
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:02,683
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,256
Dr Kang, are you okay?

3
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,492
Doctors are people, too.

4
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,294
Doctors can get MERS, too!

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,463
And sometimes, unfortunately,
we can die because of that.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,464
Are you aware of that?

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,465
Dr Kang!

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,939
Mr Go.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,277
Get me a surgical mask and a gown.

10
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,546
I'm going in.

11
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,880
You can't, Teacher Kim.

12
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,216
You're the control tower
at this hospital right now.

13
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,763
Please reconsider just one more time.

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,886
I'm going in.

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,692
I'll go in there, Doctor.

16
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,362
I'll go in there.

17
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,531
Please allow me to go in.

18
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,066
Look at you...

19
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:11,305
The doctor that the people in there
need right now... is me.

20
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,258
I...

21
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,617
...will go in.

22
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,746
Please allow me to go in.

23
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,582
Dr Kang.

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,717
Wake up, Dr Kang!

25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,919
His BP is 100/70, with 120 bpm.

26
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,088
But his fever is 104.

27
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,623
Oh my goodness.

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,659
And he was treating
patients in this state?

29
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,329
What should we do, Nurse Oh?

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,664
TEACHER KIM

31
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,651
What did you say
his body temperature was, again?

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,535
Dr Seo-Jung!

33
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,673
Please tell me his vitals and
his temperature one more time.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,041
His BP is 100/70, with 120 bpm.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,543
His temperature is 104.

36
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,599
Dr Seo-Jung.

37
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,438
Give him 200 cc of normal saline per hour
and give him some fever medicine.

38
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,806
Will that be enough?

39
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,241
It's just a syncope.

40
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,444
I think it was because
he was severely dehydrated...

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,481
...so let's get him rehydrated first
and give him tons of fluids.

42
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,952
He'll be fine after getting some sleep.

43
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,589
What about the patient
with the acute appendicitis?

44
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,557
Where is she?

45
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,491
This way.

46
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,863
But shouldn't Dr Seo-Jung not be here?

47
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,666
If they confirm that
the patients have MERS,

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,335
then she can't participate in
Chairman Shin's surgery!

49
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,003
You're right!

50
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,438
Oh no!

51
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,273
She prepared so much for it, too.

52
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,509
Could you lie down flat, please?

53
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,349
I'm going to press on your stomach a bit.

54
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,983
You may regret what you're doing.

55
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,653
That still doesn't matter to you?

56
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,057
I did think that it didn't matter.

57
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,025
At that very moment, anyway.

58
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,861
I'll go in.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,632
I wanted to be with him.

60
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,370
I wanted to stay by him.

61
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,906
At that very moment, anyway.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,207
EPISODE 14
The Effect of Paragonimiasis

63
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,075
Here you are. I'll entrust this to you.

64
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,517
Section Chief Jang!

65
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,652
Section Chief Jang!

66
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,723
I heard that some potential
MERS patients came in?

67
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,327
We're only assuming for now,
but the ER has been closed off.

68
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,596
So why aren't you
all wearing hazmat suits yet?

69
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,232
Well, that's...

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,935
Are you there?

71
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,303
Sir!

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,205
Are you home?

73
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,806
Oh! Over here, sir!

74
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,074
Please open up!

75
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,276
Oh, hello!

76
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,912
Who are you?

77
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,381
How's the situation in there?

78
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,218
The patient with acute appendicitis
is getting worse.

79
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,032
Her fever is rising,
and her pains are growing worse, too.

80
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,557
I think it's turning
into peritonitis, Doctor.

81
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,891
When will it be possible to
perform surgery on her?

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,362
I'm not going in without a hazmat suit.

83
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,964
No way!

84
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,867
Hey, what happened with the hazmat suits?

85
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,973
Do we still not have them?

86
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,369
Teacher Kim!

87
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,972
They just got in touch with
the manager of the health center!

88
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,842
They'll be here with the hazmat suits
within the next 30 minutes!

89
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,078
You heard that, Dr Song?

90
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,246
They said 30 minutes.

91
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,448
Hurry up and get ready to
perform surgery!

92
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,549
-Darn it.
-Oh!

93
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,085
Do we finally get to
see Dr Song in action?

94
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,455
It seems like you'll be performing
your first surgery here.

95
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,356
Congratulations.

96
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,224
Well, don't!

97
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,195
Darn it, why did Kang Dong-joo
have to go into the ER?

98
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,630
Okay, then.

99
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,296
I'll head in first to make preparations.

100
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,635
Okay, Yoon Seo-Jung.

101
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,105
Keep that patient stabilized
for just 30 minutes.

102
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,474
We're going to head into surgery
the moment we get the hazmat suits.

103
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,542
Yes, Doctor.

104
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,514
Give this patient propacetamol via IV
and some antibiotics, too.

105
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,715
Yes, Doctor.

106
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,350
Over here, Dr Yoon!

107
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,451
Just a moment.

108
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,158
The chairman has gotten a lot better now.

109
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,694
His temperature is back to
normal levels now...

110
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,080
...and the sound of his breathing
is a lot better now, too.

111
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,067
What's the matter, sir?

112
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,236
Did you come up here yourself,

113
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,905
or did Yoon Seo-Jung send you up here?

114
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,309
I'm not sure what you mean...

115
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:54,848
I'm curious as to how Yoon Seo-Jung
knew about Kang Dong-joo passing out.

116
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,685
That news wasn't relayed to
the staff on the second floor.

117
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:04,157
It seems that Kang Dong-joo
passed out in the ER.

118
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,629
I'm not too sure.

119
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,966
I merely came up here because
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung called me up here.

120
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,171
So are you saying that
Yoon Seo-Jung called you first?

121
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,473
Yes, that's right.

122
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,975
Is that right?

123
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,022
Oh, look who it is!

124
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,592
Looks like our super important
VIP is finally here now!

125
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,227
How are you feeling?

126
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,332
That unpleasant female doctor
stuck a bunch of things in me,

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,868
and I'm feeling better, more or less.

128
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,736
She's good at what she does.

129
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,775
And she'll be my main assistant
during your surgery.

130
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:55,742
Really?

131
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,030
So why did you switch
my doctor to someone else, then?

132
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,015
Did she get upset because of me,
by any chance?

133
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:08,021
To be frank, there's trouble
at the hospital right now, Mr Chairman.

134
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,323
What?

135
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,994
Excuse me.

136
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,198
Can't I go in there too?

137
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,399
You cannot, ma'am.

138
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,601
Please sit and wait.

139
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,236
My kids are still young.

140
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,439
My eldest is barely in middle school.

141
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,140
When the people
from the health center come,

142
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,475
they'll tell us what to do.

143
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,177
So please sit and wait.

144
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,178
Excuse me.

145
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,394
Please take a seat here
and wait for a bit.

146
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,489
Do you guys want this?

147
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,423
You must be hungry.

148
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,691
Thank you.

149
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,946
I'm sorry, Soo-Jung.

150
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,653
What were the results of the
pulmonary function tests?

151
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,254
They're being maintained at around 90.

152
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,689
And his temperature is 96.

153
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,293
He's gotten a lot better,
but his temperature is still low.

154
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,761
Please cover him with one more of these.

155
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,695
Yes, Doctor.

156
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,116
Excuse me.

157
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,911
I told you, you can't do that!

158
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,146
Please let me go in.

159
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,682
My kids are in there.

160
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,717
Please move aside!

161
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,553
Sir, calm down!

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,421
Let go!

163
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,394
Please move!

164
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,364
Please allow me to be with my children!

165
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,233
You cannot act like this here, ma'am.

166
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,568
I cannot break the rules.

167
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,772
Please allow me to be with my children!

168
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:19,079
Let go! Let me go, you little brats!

169
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,981
I don't want to die!

170
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,916
Let go!

171
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,351
Let go!

172
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:34,146
Excuse me.

173
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,730
Nobody is dying, here!

174
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,565
Nothing has happened yet,

175
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,701
and we haven't even confirmed
that it's MERS!

176
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,004
Please calm down, already.

177
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,440
What if they really do have MERS, then?

178
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,942
What are you going to do then?

179
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,889
That's more of a reason
why you shouldn't leave!

180
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,379
It's not like you'll die here and now...

181
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,482
...so to run out now would be
wishing death on everyone!

182
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,756
Do you really want to
do something like that?

183
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,425
If you cause a commotion one more time...

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,096
...I'm going to tell
your girlfriend everything...

185
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,731
...as soon as she wakes up.

186
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,270
It'd only be your own fault for
doing something humiliating.

187
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,273
Dr Yoon!

188
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,942
This patient's BP is dropping!

189
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,677
Soo-Jung.

190
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,045
Soo-Jung!

191
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,915
I see.

192
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,120
So how long will it take for
them to know for sure?

193
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,988
It'll take at least 24 hours for...

194
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,824
...the first round of test results
to come out.

195
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,562
Let me know when you know for sure.

196
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:48,101
Then I'll get discharged or go to
a different hospital, or something.

197
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:52,113
Aren't you scared, Mr Chairman?

198
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:55,645
Why would I be scared when you're here?

199
00:12:56,122 --> 00:13:01,557
But MERS isn't something
I can do anything about as a surgeon.

200
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,383
And the case fatality rate is very high.

201
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:11,959
If I were fated to die,
I would've been dead 20 years ago.

202
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,529
But considering
I'm still alive like this...

203
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,867
...I don't think I'm someone
who's fated to die that easily.

204
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:20,834
Right?

205
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,208
TEXT MESSAGE

206
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,810
Go on.

207
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,355
It seems that they're looking for you.

208
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,646
Yes, sir.

209
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,095
20 years ago, huh?

210
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,002
When are you going to tell Teacher Kim?

211
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,037
When my surgery is over.

212
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:01,074
Don't you dare say anything until then.

213
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:02,943
Got it?

214
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,378
Yes, sir.

215
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,345
Of course.

216
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,652
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,996
I received word about this too late.

218
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,154
Don't worry about it.

219
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,390
How many hazmat suits
did you bring in total?

220
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,992
We have 20 in total at our health center,

221
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,327
and I've brought them all.

222
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,035
Okay.

223
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,697
Hey, Dr Song!

224
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:24,898
Dr Song!

225
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,101
Aw man.

226
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,872
Wait, but how am I supposed to
do this alone without an assistant?

227
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,942
Even Dr Do In-bum
got assigned off to Chairman Shin!

228
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,009
You want me to do this myself?

229
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,546
Don't worry, I'll assist.

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,014
Wait... you will, sir?

231
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,549
Yeah, me.

232
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:01,045
Open the door, Nurse Eun-tak.

233
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,387
Dr Nam.

234
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,222
How are the anesthesia levels?

235
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,690
They're okay. Go ahead and start.

236
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,395
Hey.

237
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,430
Don't be nervous.

238
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,765
Who's nervous?

239
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,202
Scalpel.

240
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:19,780
Are you not going to do it?

241
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,855
There you go.

242
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,700
His fever has gone down quite a bit.

243
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,435
Yes.

244
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,171
Dr Kang has been
overworking himself, after all.

245
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,607
It seems so.

246
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,419
Your attention, please.

247
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:36,323
We've received word that someone
from the health center has just arrived.

248
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:41,762
They will now escort you home,
one by one.

249
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,297
But until we receive word about...

250
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,832
...whether or not this is MERS,

251
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,368
you should not leave your home.

252
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:52,906
And you will be monitored by
the health center until we confirm this.

253
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,044
The health center only has one vehicle...

254
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,416
...so we'll have the
hypothermia patient go home first.

255
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,584
What about those kids?

256
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,787
We'll take care of them ourselves,
so please stay out of it.

257
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:10,591
I mean, in all emergency situations,
shouldn't children be the priority?

258
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,459
What is this? It doesn't make any sense.

259
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:16,196
A patient with diabetes is the most at
risk when it comes to MERS.

260
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,335
And we're planning to
send the children out after him.

261
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,803
Oh, really?

262
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,871
I see.

263
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,508
Then... what about me?

264
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:33,981
You'll probably be among
the very last, I believe.

265
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:34,887
Goodbye.

266
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,072
He's sleeping so well.

267
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,808
Kang Dong-joo.

268
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:53,727
What? What is it?

269
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:55,596
Here's some disinfectant.

270
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,763
And put this mask on.

271
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,298
Hurry and head in there!

272
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,238
Mr Go, what's going on?

273
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,216
Teacher Kim!

274
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,057
Teacher Kim.

275
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,419
Teacher Kim!

276
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,188
Teacher Kim!

277
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:22,956
Teacher Kim!

278
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,600
Huh?

279
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,261
The results just came out.

280
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,301
Huh?

281
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,730
It's...

282
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,818
It's...

283
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:36,112
It's not MERS!

284
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,201
Our hospital's record is clean now,
Teacher Kim!

285
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,844
Dr Song!

286
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,145
Dr Song!

287
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,941
It's not MERS!

288
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,849
Our hospital's record is clean now!

289
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,659
Hooray for Doldam Hospital!

290
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,901
THERE WERE NO TRACES OF THE
MERS CORONA VIRUS IN THE SAMPLES.

291
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:12,139
What is it then, if it's not MERS?

292
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,052
Hey, give me the blood test results.

293
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,756
The blood test results.

294
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,892
Oh... oh yes, of course!

295
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,061
Oh... oh, Teacher Kim!

296
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,462
Have the results come out?

297
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,396
Yes.

298
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,333
Firstly, the test results were negative.

299
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,567
Oh, really?

300
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,474
Yes!

301
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:43,303
Thank goodness!

302
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:48,976
What a relief.

303
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,745
But... what is it, if it's not MERS?

304
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,747
I'm trying to figure that out now.

305
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,851
Hey, why are their
eosinophil levels so high?

306
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:58,758
What?

307
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,287
Eosinophil?

308
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:02,322
Eosinophil? You mean...

309
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,265
By any chance,

310
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,011
have you eaten any raw freshwater animals
in the past couple months?

311
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,611
Freshwater?

312
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes.

313
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,874
No, we haven't eaten anything raw.

314
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,311
We don't even eat sashimi that often.

315
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:26,513
Oh. Mom.

316
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,183
What about fermented soy crabs?

317
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,585
Do you cook fermented soy crabs?

318
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:32,853
Fermented soy crabs?

319
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,766
Was that made out of
Chinese mitten crabs, by any chance?

320
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,090
Oh, yes!

321
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,327
My mother brought some
since my husband likes it.

322
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:41,795
Remember?

323
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,631
She brought it just before your trip,
saying they were in season.

324
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,567
How long ago was that?

325
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,468
It was before I went on
my business trip...

326
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,305
...so about two months ago.

327
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,731
But why are you asking about that?

328
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,874
Nurse Eun-tak.

329
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,242
Let's do a sputum test on them.

330
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,143
A sputum test?

331
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,878
I think it may be paragonimiasis.

332
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,226
That's probably why their
eosinophil levels came out high.

333
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,015
Oh, I'm an idiot!

334
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:04,196
Why didn't I see that before?

335
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:12,526
Despite everything,
you still sent Dr Yoon in.

336
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,997
She could've lost her chance at
operating on the chairman, too.

337
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,468
Well, I couldn't hold her back.

338
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,147
I see.

339
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:46,827
And thus, the MERS scare
that had all of us in a frenzy ended...

340
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:50,160
...when we discovered
that it was actually paragonimiasis...

341
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:53,220
...caused by fermented soy crabs that
hadn't been fermented long enough.

342
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,937
And...

343
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,096
When did you wake up?

344
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,365
Not too long ago.

345
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,467
Oh, really?

346
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,182
Oh, your fever is gone now.

347
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,655
And you're not as pale anymore.

348
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,526
Are you dizzy? Do you have any ear pains?

349
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,600
You were severely overworked.

350
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,370
You lacked sleep,
were dehydrated, and malnourished.

351
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,773
Why are you so stubborn?

352
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:43,094
And you've been eating and sleeping only
in the staff room for two months.

353
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,481
It's true, right?

354
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:48,826
What are you talking about?

355
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,318
That you stayed by
my side the whole time.

356
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,289
And you even held my hand.

357
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,258
You must be hungry.

358
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll go and get you some food.

359
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,730
It's true, isn't it?

360
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,766
Did you have a dream, or something?

361
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:06,767
I didn't do that.

362
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:10,838
So that didn't happen?

363
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,207
Nope. It didn't.

364
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,707
So you're really saying
that it didn't happen?

365
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,045
Probably.

366
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,417
Really?

367
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,354
What are you doing?

368
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:33,660
I'm trying to find out for myself
whether or not you're lying.

369
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:37,464
Oh, you avoided my gaze just now.

370
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,399
What do you mean? When did I do that?

371
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:47,941
Oh yeah.

372
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,611
The patients ended up
having paragonimiasis.

373
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:51,712
They didn't have MERS.

374
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,747
Oh, is that right?

375
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:58,018
Yeah. It was because of some soy crabs
that weren't fermented long enough.

376
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,522
So... it was paragonimiasis.

377
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,758
Isn't that funny?

378
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:07,294
Yes, it is.

379
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,468
Oh, fine, fine! Yes, it was me!

380
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:15,769
I was by your side!

381
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,272
You were, right?

382
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,974
And you even held my hand.

383
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:25,512
Well, that was just to check
if your fever was gone or not.

384
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:28,182
Hey, do you know how high your fever was?

385
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,783
104!

386
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,485
Your fever was that high.

387
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,894
What are you doing?

388
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:42,629
Hey...

389
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,666
It's only because I feel a bit dizzy.

390
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,736
I'm going to lean on you
for just a little bit.

391
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:51,872
If you're dizzy, you should eat.

392
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,181
You... should eat.

393
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:06,220
I no longer had the strength to
push him away.

394
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:16,797
Oh, this paragonimiasisish little...

395
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:07,848
Ms Woo Yeon-hwa?

396
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,116
Hello.

397
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,784
I'm a government-contracted doctor
assigned to Doldam Hospital.

398
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,219
Woo Yeon-hwa.

399
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,188
I'm pleased to be working with you all.

400
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,457
What's going on, Director Yeo?

401
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:19,726
Oh, she was a resident at
Gangwon University Hospital.

402
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:23,697
Wait, but I thought you were Chinese.

403
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,132
I'm a foreign exchange student.

404
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:26,300
A foreign exchange student?

405
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,868
Oh, wow!

406
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,403
I guess your family
is quite well-off, then.

407
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,638
My mother is Korean.

408
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:32,573
I see.

409
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,143
Then why did you show up looking
like a bum at our hospital before?

410
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,613
I was in my residency course,
and then ran away.

411
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,583
Then you should've
told us from the start!

412
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:46,687
Because I wasn't planning on
being a doctor ever again.

413
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,755
Because it was so hard.

414
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,460
So why the change of heart
all of a sudden, then?

415
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,197
Because of the staff here.

416
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:00,601
I watched the staff here work hard...

417
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:05,906
...and felt that I wanted to
become a real doctor, too.

418
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:10,043
At any rate, I'm happy to hear
that a familiar face will be joining us.

419
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,411
Isn't that right, Teacher Kim?

420
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:12,613
So?

421
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:14,147
What's your specialty?

422
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,749
General surgery.

423
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:18,886
Wow, general surgery, huh?

424
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,587
That's great!

425
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,124
Even foreigners are choosing to
go into general surgery.

426
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,627
This is the problem with
medical students in Korea.

427
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,096
They want to go into plastic surgery
or dermatology for the money.

428
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,399
Nobody wants to go into general surgery
or cardiothoracic surgery anymore.

429
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,700
Does that make any sense?

430
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,102
Here, in our great nation of Korea.

431
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,403
Oh geez.

432
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,638
Look here.

433
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,106
That may be true,

434
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,575
but that's not something
to be bringing up now, is it?

435
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,310
Oh... is that right?

436
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,345
I apologize.

437
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,416
I'll think of myself as starting over
as an intern and work hard.

438
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,752
I'm looking forward to your cooperation.

439
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:58,091
Wow, so you were a resident, Ms Yeon-hwa?

440
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,803
I'm here as a
government-contracted doctor...

441
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,663
...but it's fine to think of me as an
intern and use me however you'd like.

442
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:03,664
Really?

443
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:07,000
Well, your mindset is good.

444
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,403
But, are you fit?

445
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,672
Yes, and I'm very determined!

446
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:14,842
Oh, you're even determined, too!

447
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:20,080
Hello, Doctor.

448
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,115
Oh, Ms Yeon-hwa!

449
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,952
Apparently, she was a resident at
Gangwon University Hospital.

450
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,854
And a general surgery resident, at that!

451
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:28,522
Oh, really?

452
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:29,690
General surgery?

453
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:31,191
Yes.

454
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,593
That's great.

455
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,395
From now on,

456
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:38,165
I'll give you sage advice
that will become integral to you.

457
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,533
So you, Yeon-hwa...

458
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,635
It's okay if I just call you
by your name, right?

459
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:42,903
Yes, that's fine.

460
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,304
You can call me whatever you'd like.

461
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,439
Okay, then!

462
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,609
All you have to do, Yeon-hwa,
is trust and follow me.

463
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:49,510
Yes.

464
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,844
Be careful, Ms Yeon-hwa.

465
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:54,681
Dr Yoon Seo-jung's
nickname is "Crazy Whale."

466
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,949
How dare!

467
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,751
What, It's true, though...

468
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:58,719
Hey, Dong-joo.

469
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,120
Want some pizza?

470
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:01,622
-Whoa!
-What?

471
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,969
-Where did this pizza come from?
-I bought it yesterday.

472
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,726
I just reheated it and
it's nice and warm.

473
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,227
Eat up, okay?

474
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:08,762
Eat as much as you want!

475
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:10,764
I'll buy all your snacks from now on!

476
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,299
I mean it. 100 percent!

477
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,901
Thanks, Dr Yoon.

478
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,702
Would you like some too,
Section Chief Jang?

479
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,871
No, I'm on a diet.

480
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,873
Yeon-hwa, come over and have some.

481
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,909
We have to eat a lot when we can.

482
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:22,876
Because if you don't...

483
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:23,777
We have traffic accident patients!

484
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,112
All three are middle-aged.

485
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:27,047
Oh... you saw that, right?

486
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,649
This is how it is around here.

487
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:29,950
They'll be here in three minutes.

488
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,485
Oh, three minutes!

489
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:39,326
Please take your time to unpack and
come over when you're finished.

490
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,161
-Yes, I will.
-Goodbye, then.

491
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,401
It's nice to see you again, Ms Yeon-hwa.

492
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:48,602
Yes.

493
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:53,140
She was in a car accident!

494
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:54,575
She's a 35-year-old female...

495
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,810
...and we believe she hit her
head hard on the steering wheel.

496
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:58,679
Her BP is normal and
she seems to be a bit nauseated.

497
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,647
She also feels severe pain and dizziness.

498
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:01,582
What are her vitals?

499
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,450
BP is 100/65, with 120 bpm.

500
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:05,052
She may have some hemorrhaging,

501
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:06,753
so give her some maxeran
and take a CT scan of her brain.

502
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,654
Yes, Doctor.

503
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:08,989
One, two, three!

504
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,692
She was in the passenger seat
when the window shattered,

505
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:12,598
and she hurt her arm.

506
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,261
Ma'am, please don't cry!

507
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,762
I'll be examining you for a second.

508
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,532
Does anything else besides your arm hurt?

509
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,767
No. Please take it out.

510
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,636
There may be more glass
more deeply embedded,

511
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:23,904
so we'll take an x-ray first.

512
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,172
Nurse Park, take an x-ray of her, please.

513
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,240
Yes, Doctor.

514
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,522
-Where is he hurt?
-He has shoulder pain.

515
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,114
Oh, it's dislocated.

516
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,351
Sir, we believe your shoulder is
dislocated so we'll take an x-ray first.

517
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,519
-X-ray him, please.
-Yes.

518
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:39,865
-Can you take care of it?
-Yes.

519
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,935
Oh, you're back?
Please lie on that bed over there...

520
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,007
Teacher... Kim. Teacher... Kim.

521
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,643
Please call... Teacher... Kim.

522
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:03,610
Oh!

523
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:04,678
Excuse me!

524
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,846
Sir!

525
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:06,980
Mr Go?

526
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,425
Is it heart attack?

527
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,094
This patient has a pacemaker.

528
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,233
What are his vitals?

529
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,802
BP is 60/40, and he's not breathing.

530
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:29,937
What should we do?

531
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:32,639
Please call Teacher Kim.

532
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,141
And intubate him.

533
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,375
Let's move the patient.

534
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:45,152
Hey, why are you still
using the Ambu bag?

535
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,187
You have to hurry and
put a ventilator on him!

536
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:50,290
Oh... I was just about to do that.

537
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,560
Nurse Oh.

538
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:55,796
Mix dopamine and dobutamine together...

539
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,030
...and give him 10 cc per hour.

540
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,032
And prepare some isoket,

541
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,068
and only give it to him
when his BP goes up.

542
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,970
And put a Foley in him,
and check his urine.

543
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,037
Yes, Doctor.

544
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,451
Here are the ABGA results.

545
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:21,722
I think it'd be good for you to
go over there.

546
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:24,424
All right.

547
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,127
Here are the results for the ABGA.

548
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,263
It's respiratory acidosis.

549
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,697
I'll do a echocardiogram on him.

550
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:47,781
Oh... the ejection fraction in
his DCMP is dropping a lot.

551
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,817
It's only about 25 to 30 percent.

552
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,120
You said you've done
an ECMO before, right?

553
00:35:53,187 --> 00:35:54,254
Yes, I have.

554
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,355
No, not you.

555
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:56,262
Hey!

556
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,325
I'm talking to you, Do In-bum.

557
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,627
Yes, I have, but...

558
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:02,896
Okay. You take care of it today, then.

559
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:05,566
And you assist him, Yoon Seo-Jung.

560
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,000
And call Dr Nam Do-il.

561
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,602
Call him before the ECMO machine's here.

562
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:09,837
Yes, sir.

563
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,884
What are you doing, sir?

564
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,620
Could you help me a bit?

565
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:27,921
With what?

566
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,025
What's this?

567
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:38,031
I want to give a gift to a woman
whose name I cannot tell you.

568
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:40,825
Which one do you think is better,
this one or this one?

569
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:42,970
A Christmas gift?

570
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,538
Isn't it romantic?

571
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,207
A present given amidst
a white blanket of snow.

572
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,609
A warm, cozy hug.

573
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,410
Yes. And...

574
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,185
Oh, I'm sorry.

575
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:04,358
If you also have a woman
whose name you do not wish to reveal...

576
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:07,528
...how about making a move by
giving her a Christmas gift?

577
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,030
No thanks.

578
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,231
I'm okay.

579
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,737
Really, though?

580
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,243
Man.

581
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:28,782
Is this better?

582
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:31,685
Oh, this is nice.

583
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,424
Start.

584
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,692
Needle, please.

585
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,004
Guidewire.

586
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,060
Scalpel.

587
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:06,787
Gauze.

588
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:10,591
Give me the smallest dilator you have.

589
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,408
The next smallest one.

590
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,594
I'll put the cannulas in now.

591
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:57,371
Are you sure about this?

592
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:01,308
What?

593
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,777
I asked you if you're sure
this is the right one!

594
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:09,550
I think that Dr Do In-bum
got confused for a second.

595
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,718
The infusion line is the red one.

596
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,086
Oh.

597
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,422
I was too focused.

598
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,062
I guess I got confused for a second.

599
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,329
Stop.

600
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:24,198
Yoon Seo-Jung.

601
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:25,699
Switch spots with Do In-bum.

602
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,902
Nurse Oh, please assist.

603
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:29,837
Yes, Doctor.

604
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,172
Do In-bum.

605
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,142
Follow me outside.

606
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,588
Answer me honestly.

607
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:51,258
What's the difference between
the venovenous and venoarterial in ECMO?

608
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:54,528
The venovenous is used
when there is only respiratory failure...

609
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,364
...and the venoarterial is used
when there is heart failure as well.

610
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:58,265
And what we did before?

611
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,499
Venoarterial.

612
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:02,269
And why did you put a drain line
all the way up to the right atrium?

613
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:06,206
Because there could be an IVC collapse
when the ECMO flow increases.

614
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,407
And why is that a problem?

615
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,910
Because there won't be
enough blood in the return drain.

616
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,945
You know that so well!

617
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,149
And yet you got the cannulas mixed up?

618
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,229
I'm sure it seemed
as if anyone could do it...

619
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,655
...as long as they knew the technique.

620
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:25,592
But there's something you overlooked.

621
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,926
When it comes to ECMO surgeries,

622
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,697
there is an intricate awareness of
physiology involved.

623
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:33,517
It's not just about simply
sticking cannulas in the patient.

624
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:41,875
You may be able to
deceive me with your words...

625
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:47,245
...but you can never deceive me
with these hands of yours.

626
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:51,335
Because a surgeon's hands can
only move with purpose and precision,

627
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,428
if they have experience and effort.

628
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,563
As for why you lied to me about
doing something you've never done,

629
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:07,334
how far you thought
you could trick me with your imitations,

630
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,603
and why you even went so far to do it...

631
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:13,640
I won't ask for the reason.

632
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,310
However.

633
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:22,549
Don't degrade yourself by
becoming an expendable person.

634
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,419
Did you head straight here
from the airport?

635
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:02,055
I had to, after hearing
the chairman was hospitalized.

636
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:03,323
Where is he now?

637
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,425
Is he in critical condition?

638
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,794
He's currently not at this hospital.

639
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,196
Didn't you say
he was hospitalized, though?

640
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:12,633
He's at a small hospital
called Doldam in Jungsun.

641
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:16,336
Actually, that's the reason
for the emergency meeting.

642
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,116
What?

643
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,552
Is there something wrong with me?

644
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,155
I think what I'd feared has happened.

645
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:38,825
Don't try to scare me,
and just give it to me straight.

646
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:44,264
I believe that there's an issue
with your artificial heart.

647
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:50,003
In this case, I'll have to change...

648
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,873
...out the artificial heart itself
and not the batteries.

649
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,444
But this isn't that
simple of a surgery, you see.

650
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,114
Does it make any sense?

651
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:02,182
Why would he have...

652
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,284
...such a dangerous surgery done
at that tiny hospital?

653
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,320
I, too, tried to talk him
out of this many times.

654
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:08,789
But he was resolute in his decision.

655
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,859
And this is why I asked you
to come all this way.

656
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,193
To ask this favor.

657
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:18,565
I'm well acquainted with
my old man's stubbornness.

658
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,926
He'll never change his decision
once he puts his mind to it.

659
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:25,506
So, who's the doctor in charge of him?

660
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:26,907
Is it a skilled doctor?

661
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,775
It's someone they call "Teacher Kim."

662
00:43:29,142 --> 00:43:30,344
Teacher Kim?

663
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:33,881
I don't know if you remember...

664
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:38,519
...but he once went by the name
Bu Yong-joo and worked at Geosan.

665
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:40,554
Bu Yong-joo...

666
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:45,225
Are you talking about
that crazy little brat?

667
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:51,632
What, are you wussing out now
that the time has finally come?

668
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:54,334
We should remove and
discard your old artificial heart...

669
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,371
...and put a new artificial heart
inside of you.

670
00:43:57,437 --> 00:43:59,439
That in itself is quite a rare case.

671
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:01,842
This is so rare that

672
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:08,215
there aren't even survival
statistics published about this.

673
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:10,517
What an honor this will be for you, then.

674
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:15,789
I'm even giving you an opportunity to
perform that kind of surgery.

675
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,692
What, do you have no confidence?

676
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:21,361
If that's not the case,
I want you to do it.

677
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:28,101
May I ask you the reason
why you trust me this much?

678
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:30,003
I already told you.

679
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:35,409
I'm someone who tries to survive,
no matter what.

680
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,813
And you're someone who tries to
save people, no matter what.

681
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,116
And since those two stubborn
little brats have come together...

682
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:48,522
I'm sure my chance at survival
will go up by that much, too.

683
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:53,894
All doctors do their best to
save patients, Mr Chairman.

684
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,929
Do you think they'd really do that...

685
00:44:55,996 --> 00:45:00,434
...if they were receiving
billions of dollars not to?

686
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,739
-Pardon?
-Be quiet and you do it.

687
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:09,527
At the very least,

688
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:12,913
I'll die without suspicions or regrets
if I die in your operating room.

689
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:22,789
I'll do a CT scan of your chest tomorrow.

690
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:25,058
And we can continue with...

691
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,728
...the rest of the tests we couldn't do,
due to the MERS scare.

692
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:39,606
I've scheduled Chairman Shin's
surgery, nine days from today.

693
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,944
We'll be discarding the artificial heart
that's currently in his body,

694
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:47,814
and replacing it
with a new artificial heart.

695
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:51,238
-Kang Dong-joo.
-Yes, sir?

696
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:53,764
You'll be in charge of discarding
the batteries on the old model.

697
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,956
They were placed in him two years ago...

698
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,425
...so there will be a lot of
fibrous tissue on them.

699
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,527
Once you've discarded them,

700
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,497
I'll start with
the removal of the old model.

701
00:46:03,564 --> 00:46:04,431
Got it?

702
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:05,399
Yes, sir.

703
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:07,201
-Yoon Seo-Jung.
-Yes, Doctor?

704
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,003
You'll be my main assistant,
as I said before.

705
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:14,408
Speed is key here, so make sure
you can keep up with me.

706
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,676
Yes, sir.

707
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,868
Do In-bum.

708
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,851
This time, you will assist Kang Dong-joo.

709
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:24,785
Got it?

710
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,658
Yes, sir.

711
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,123
Okay, I plan on doing three simulations...

712
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,725
...prior to the real surgery.

713
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:36,328
I'll let you all know the schedule
as soon as I choose the dates and times.

714
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:39,166
So be aware of that, and be prepared.
Okay, that's all!

715
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:43,570
Okay. Are you all ready?

716
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:44,477
Yes.

717
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,475
Scalpel.

718
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:54,047
Until we proceed with
the artificial heart,

719
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:57,917
we'll allot three hours from the initial
incision and insertion of the cannulas.

720
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,966
And 45 minutes for
the subcision in the abdomen,

721
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:02,456
the removal of the battery,

722
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:05,092
as well as the controller.

723
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,296
So there are only 45 minutes allotted
from the subcision to the removal?

724
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,598
No. That 45 minutes includes
suturing up the subcision, too.

725
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,601
You shouldn't forget that
the patient is a 72-year-old man.

726
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,271
We have to shorten the length
of the surgery as much as we can.

727
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,177
Yes, sir.

728
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,691
Change positions!

729
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,633
We'll give two hours for
the removal of his current model...

730
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:26,084
...and another two hours for
the installation of the new model.

731
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:27,948
Then one hour for hemostasis,

732
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:30,117
and one hour to close up his chest area.

733
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:34,955
So the entire surgery will
take 9 hours and 45 minutes, then.

734
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:36,323
No, no.

735
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,258
We have to make it even shorter.

736
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:42,629
We need to finish in seven hours to
minimize the damages done on the patient.

737
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:47,868
First, let's shorten the starting of
the artificial heart by one hour.

738
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:53,106
And let's shorten the time for removal
and installation by 30 minutes each.

739
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:55,175
We'll still be 45 minutes over
our ideal time, though.

740
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:58,245
Then, I'll try my best to
finish my part in 30 minutes.

741
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:01,748
I'll have the subcision in the abdomen,
the removal of the battery,

742
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:02,950
and controller done within 30 minutes.

743
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:04,576
30 minutes, including stitching him up.

744
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:08,488
I'll try my best.

745
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,858
Don't say that you will try.

746
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:11,959
I'll do it, sir.

747
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,160
Okay.

748
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:18,232
We'll still be 30 minutes
over our ideal time, though.

749
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:19,766
Do you have any ideas?

750
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,036
The preparations for the surgery
are going better than we'd expected.

751
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:27,274
Everyone still thinks that
it will succeed, for now.

752
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,444
And Chairman Shin
seems to think that, too.

753
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:35,382
Well, things can change at any moment.

754
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:39,653
By the way... how much longer
do I need to stay here?

755
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,455
Until I tell you to leave.

756
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:45,259
Until then, don't complain
and just bear it.

757
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,060
I'll call you again later.

758
00:48:54,868 --> 00:49:00,340
Don't degrade yourself by
becoming an expendable person.

759
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:04,444
Thank you.

760
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:06,246
Huh?

761
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,515
One of these is mine.

762
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:09,550
But who is this for?

763
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,285
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TO...

764
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:14,188
Oh, this is...

765
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:41,949
Okay.

766
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,458
What am I doing right now?

767
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,308
Are you... leaving work?

768
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,044
Um, yeah. I'm a bit tired.

769
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,980
I'm going to head home early and rest.

770
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:14,248
Oh. I... see.

771
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:19,920
I'll get going now.

772
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:21,989
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

773
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,926
I have another package for you.

774
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:27,895
What package?

775
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:31,598
I don't know, but I think it may be
a gift from someone...

776
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:33,500
...who wants to spend Christmas with you.

777
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:36,136
What could it be?

778
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:18,445
Dong-joo.

779
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,314
See me for a second.

780
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,291
I thought you said she'd like it.

781
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:33,227
Everyone else usually does.

782
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,205
Maybe she just doesn't
like things like that?

783
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,897
Maybe she's more into bags than jewelry?

784
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:49,776
What is this?

785
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,746
A Christmas gift.

786
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,751
I heard that women like to
receive things like that.

787
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:00,754
Take it back.

788
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:09,096
Why?

789
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:11,498
Do you not like it?

790
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,467
I just don't want to accept this.

791
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:15,836
Take it back.

792
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,446
What do you mean, exactly...

793
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,762
when you say that
you don't want to accept this?

794
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:34,388
What other meaning would there be?

795
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,824
I just don't want to accept it, is all.

796
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:45,566
Am I that unlikable?

797
00:52:49,136 --> 00:52:51,238
Do you really not see me...

798
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:55,742
...as a man?

799
00:52:57,044 --> 00:52:57,911
It's not like that.

800
00:52:57,978 --> 00:52:59,146
What is it, then?

801
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:08,322
How do you feel about me, exactly?

802
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:17,497
I...

803
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:24,071
...like you.

804
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:32,880
Then why?

805
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:34,381
But...

806
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,818
...the more I grow to like you...

807
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:41,655
...the more I remember the accident
from five years ago.

808
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,894
But I can't allow myself to do that.

809
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,800
I can't help that my feelings for you
overlap with my memories of the accident.

810
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,139
That's just too unfair to you...

811
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,277
...and I'd feel so bad
for feeling that way.

812
00:54:06,046 --> 00:54:07,347
That's why.

813
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,353
So, Kang Dong-joo...

814
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:14,721
We...

815
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:16,089
I'm okay with that, though.

816
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:24,731
I've never expected anything
from you, Dr Yoon.

817
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:30,504
And I heard the answer that
I wanted to hear just now.

818
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,508
That's all you have to do.

819
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,644
I'm fine with everything,

820
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:41,515
as long as you like me.

821
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,390
So, please...

822
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:56,697
So, Dr Yoon...

823
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,280
I can't?
