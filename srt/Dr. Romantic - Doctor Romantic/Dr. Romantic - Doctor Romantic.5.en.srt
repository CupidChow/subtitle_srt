1
00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:02,700
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim.

2
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,570
A doctor who has a success rate
of 97 percent.

3
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,652
The only triple board certified doctor
in the entire nation...

4
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,205
...able to even save those on their deathbed.
Also known as the "God’s Hand."

5
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,472
A legend among legends amidst surgeons.

6
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,245
He had droves of people from all over,

7
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,457
desperate to receive surgery from him.

8
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:52,966
And when he was at the peak
of his popularity,

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,323
he mysteriously vanished.

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,424
I'm talking about him.

11
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:00,991
He's him, isn't he?

12
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:02,805
I don't know.

13
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:05,632
EPISODE 5

14
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,595
Come on. I'm right, aren't I?

15
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,421
I don’t know what you mean...

16
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:11,171
About Teacher Kim's true identity.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,955
He's Dr Bu Yong-ju, right?

18
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,812
Sorry to say this,

19
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,621
but that isn't an issue about
which I can offer you an answer.

20
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,124
You still have my letter of resignation,
right?

21
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you mean this?

22
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,659
If Teacher Kim really is Dr Bu Yong-ju,

23
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,981
you can rip up this letter of resignation.

24
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,955
Are you saying that you'll stay
at Doldam Hospital?

25
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:44,278
Is it all right for me to interpret
your words to mean that,

26
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,381
Dr Kang Dong-joo?

27
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:48,809
Only if Teacher Kim
is actually Dr Bu Yong-ju.

28
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:01,088
I thought you'd be back later tonight.

29
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,275
How did your meeting
with the chairman of the board go?

30
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,272
What's the matter, sir?

31
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,399
Did something go wrong at Jeongseon?

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,519
What is it, sir?

33
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,470
Did the chairman of the board say
something unpleasant?

34
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,371
That little jerk...

35
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,605
Excuse me?

36
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,440
Bu Yong-ju.

37
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,462
That little jerk is back.

38
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,603
He was there...

39
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,883
...at Doldam Hospital.

40
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,037
An era in which one's success
trumps everything else.

41
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:34,834
Suction!

42
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,525
The bleeding won't stop, sir!

43
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,656
-Suction!
-Yes, sir!

44
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:43,920
An era in which everything,
including one's morals and others' lives,

45
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:46,423
is pushed aside
for someone's own selfish gains.

46
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:51,605
Defibrillator! Hurry!

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,150
360 Joules! Clear!

48
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:58,612
360 Joules!

49
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,380
Clear!

50
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,724
Doctor. I don't think
the patient will make it, sir.

51
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,078
Darn it!

52
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:18,799
People who offered excuses and justified
his or her actions saying that...

53
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,502
...it couldn't be helped,
while sacrificing others.

54
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,008
Why, you little...

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,808
People said they didn't want to be
targeted by those in power...

56
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,936
...and used their own lack of power...

57
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,974
...as an excuse to turn a blind eye
to the truth.

58
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,965
Such cowards banded together...

59
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,548
...and dominated the world out
of a sense of entitlement.

60
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:01,554
We can't just leave things
as they are then, sir.

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,900
There isn't much time
until the renewal of your directorship.

62
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,679
So how could the chairman
of the board make such a decision?

63
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,350
We'll have to stop that surgery
from happening at all costs, won't we?

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,256
Kang Dong-joo is down there
right now, right?

65
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,858
Excuse me?

66
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:21,135
Answer me, already.

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,435
I'm right, aren't I?

68
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,628
He's Dr Bu Yong-ju.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,861
Right?

70
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:38,579
I never explicitly said anything!

71
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,148
Oh, of course.

72
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,789
Use Kang Dong-joo as best as you can.

73
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,191
He'll have to make a bit of an effort...

74
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,161
...if he ever wants to come back here.

75
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,158
Don't you agree, Chief Song?

76
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,835
Oh, yes. I understand.

77
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,947
CHAPTER 5
Relative Principles

78
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,902
What? Helper?

79
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes. Helper.

80
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:36,130
Have you really decided to accept this?

81
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,564
I have to, there's no other choice.

82
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,399
It's not like I can go and find a job
at another hospital.

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,969
I've lost points with him
due to my own mistake

84
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,471
so I'll have to try and get them back,
no matter what it takes.

85
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,260
With grace and perseverance.

86
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,509
With spirit and tenacity.

87
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,532
Did you tell Teacher Kim?

88
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,479
Of course I did.

89
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,133
-You'll do it?
-Yes, Teacher Kim.

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,927
I'll do my best, no matter
what my position may be.

91
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,990
-Really?
-Yes, of course.

92
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:07,609
I'll find a way to control my condition
on my own, sir.

93
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,062
So what did he say after you said that?

94
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,465
He just said...

95
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:11,532
Okay.

96
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,076
Leave, then.

97
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,571
Geez...

98
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,130
He was being a bit much.

99
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,577
I feel like he's only this harsh
toward you, Dr Yoon.

100
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,914
I know! He's always really nice to us.

101
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,931
Well, I guess I have something he hates.

102
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,651
Will you really be okay?

103
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,352
I'll have to force myself to be
okay with it, even if I'm not.

104
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,583
I'll be okay, right?

105
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,195
This was the right decision
for me to make, right?

106
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,498
Please, tell me that
I made the right decision!

107
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,435
So this is where all of you were.

108
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,305
I have some great news.

109
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,874
Dr Kang Dong-joo,

110
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,210
who passed the board
with the highest marks nationwide...

111
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,615
...has decided to stay at Doldam Hospital!

112
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,990
I'm sure that this wasn't
an easy decision for him.

113
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:08,922
So let's give him a round of applause
to welcome him back, shall we?

114
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,100
What's with this gloomy atmosphere?

115
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,369
Can someone explain what's going on?

116
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,505
I am going back to work then.

117
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,644
Why is Dr Yoon Seo-Jung acting like that?

118
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,662
Did something happen?

119
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,924
Can't you tell?

120
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,082
Isn't it obvious just by looking at her?

121
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,752
Teacher Kim didn't chase
Dr Yoon out, did he?

122
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,224
Is that what happened?

123
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,922
He did something even meaner than that.

124
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,223
What would possibly be worse
than chasing her out?

125
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,394
What could that possibly be?

126
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,402
So you're a helper?

127
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,138
Are you really going to do this?

128
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,541
Well, why can't I?

129
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,472
It's all hospital work, anyway.

130
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,560
I see.

131
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,680
So I can boss you around, then.
Right, Dr Yoon?

132
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,416
Are you planning to take advantage of me?

133
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,450
It doesn't matter, does it?

134
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,352
After all, it's all hospital work,
like you said.

135
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,083
Why did you change your mind
about leaving all of the sudden?

136
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,541
I thought you were quitting!

137
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,861
I thought you said that
you'd go to a better hospital.

138
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,897
So why are you still here,
being a pain in my butt?

139
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,132
Why?

140
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,733
Teacher Kim.

141
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,137
I want to know more about him.

142
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,608
Hey, excuse me. Did you forget?

143
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,778
A couple of hours ago,

144
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,513
you got angry and threw a tantrum...

145
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,082
...about how you couldn't acknowledge
Teacher Kim's ways.

146
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,986
And you said that you'd quit working
at this lousy excuse for a hospital.

147
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,321
And here you are now, saying,

148
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,724
"I want to know more about him."

149
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,660
Or whatever.

150
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,896
Well, I didn't know
who Teacher Kim was back then.

151
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,801
I heard that he's Dr Bu Yong-ju.

152
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,036
The only triple-board certified doctor
in the country...

153
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,972
...with a 97 percent success rate
when it comes to surgery.

154
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,052
"The God’s Hand."

155
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,542
A legend among legends.

156
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,611
How did you know that?

157
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,497
Wow, I knew it.

158
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,318
So all of you were aware that
he's actually Dr Bu Yong-ju, huh?

159
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,622
And yet you acted
as if you didn't know in front of me?

160
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,391
So what? What are you planning to do now?

161
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,893
You don't know?

162
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,830
I'm going to stay here for the time being
and learn a thing or two from him.

163
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,232
He isn't someone to take lightly,
you know.

164
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,269
He's honestly the prickliest person
I've met.

165
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,471
He's not someone
who can be won over so easily.

166
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,175
I thought you said that
you wanted to see me.

167
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,448
And I'll never know
why you wanted to see me...

168
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,450
...if I leave now.

169
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,056
That's the other reason.

170
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,961
This is a hospital, you know.

171
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,030
Don't be shooting
some romantic drama here. Got it?

172
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,236
Can't we, though?

173
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,335
What kind of bull is that?

174
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,144
If you have time to be doing that,
go get some sleep instead.

175
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,645
Or eat some more.

176
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,947
We can do it together, then.

177
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,917
We can eat together,
and sleep together, too.

178
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,988
That's what romance is all about.

179
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,260
There isn't much else to it.

180
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,002
It's your fault.

181
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,040
What's the matter?

182
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,075
Are you okay...

183
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,778
It's your fault that I died.

184
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,348
It's your fault.

185
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,473
It's your fault that I died.

186
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,653
It's your fault.

187
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,061
It's fine.
I'll get it since I'm the helper.

188
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,534
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

189
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,471
How many?

190
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,811
A group of cyclists
were run over by a truck!

191
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,413
It seems that the driver
was falling asleep at the wheel...

192
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,748
...and there have been
three casualties already!

193
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,584
The accident was so horrific that news
about it is all over the web!

194
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,725
There are investigators and news reporters
from the area here now!

195
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:36,356
News teams from the area are
trying to get in here!

196
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,927
Move him to the hybrid room
and put a saline drip and a Foley in him!

197
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,361
Prepare the Foleys and the tubes!

198
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,863
Yes, Nurse.

199
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,462
There are seven patients,
and we have four more on their way.

200
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,468
One of the seven was dead on arrival
and two of them have minor injuries.

201
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,037
One of them has a spleen injury,

202
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,256
a left hemopneumothorax
as well as a hemoperitoneum.

203
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,992
The sound of his left lung is weak.

204
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,489
How bad is the internal hemorrhage?

205
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,378
About 1,000 cc on his left side,
I believe.

206
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,215
We'll stabilize and put some tubes
in him before taking him to the OR.

207
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,216
Okay.

208
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,813
We'll start operating on him right now.

209
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,292
May I assist you then, sir?

210
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,590
I want to see you operating.

211
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,226
Didn't you say that you'd leave
after treating that last patient?

212
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,480
That's what I heard.

213
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,896
Haven't you heard yet, sir?

214
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,899
I decided to stay at Doldam Hospital.

215
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,068
So I can assist you then, right?

216
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,490
Hey, someone call Dr Nam.

217
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,419
Someone already did. I just got here.

218
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,778
It's a hemoperitoneum.
Please prepare him for surgery.

219
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,247
Sure, leave it to me.

220
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:35,575
Oh yeah, Miss Helper.

221
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:39,786
Call Dr Yang of Jungil Hospital
over here too, just in case.

222
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,021
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,244
He's going into cardiac arrest!

224
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,557
What are you doing, Dr Kang?

225
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:12,136
You're not going to insert
the chest tube?

226
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:13,820
Oh, yes.

227
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,857
We have a patient!

228
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,724
-Where are his injuries?
-His right knee and pelvis.

229
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,996
His BP is 90/150.

230
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,064
Does your stomach hurt?

231
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,893
My pelvis. My pelvis!

232
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,790
Nurse Park!

233
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:13,881
Did I...

234
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:15,983
No way.

235
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,900
What... What do I do?

236
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,828
I can't believe this. I...

237
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,310
Ki-chul. Are you okay?

238
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,945
Ready, sir.

239
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,417
Step back, everyone. Clear.

240
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,162
Checking his vitals.

241
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,064
Okay, one more time. 200 joules.

242
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,465
Ready, sir.

243
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,436
Step back, everyone. Clear!

244
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,805
His pulse isn't coming back.

245
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,311
We have four more patients that
just came in, Doctor.

246
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,378
Two of them have minor injuries,

247
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,117
and one broke his collarbone
but his vitals are fine.

248
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:25,237
One has pain in his pelvis
and I think he's broken his pelvic bone.

249
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,703
Doctor.

250
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,130
Teacher Kim.

251
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,056
Time of death...

252
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,242
...15:16.

253
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,460
Where does he need treatment?

254
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:23,302
He has pain in his pelvis.
I think he broke his pelvic bone.

255
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,511
Get me a sheet.

256
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,692
That little jerk...

257
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,096
It was you, wasn't it?
You were the driver, weren't you?

258
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,365
Yeah, you were.

259
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,734
Why did you do that?

260
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,774
How dare you do that, you little brat?
You little brat!

261
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,709
Please, calm down!

262
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:58,345
You're not even a human!
You're a darned murderer!

263
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,176
-Sir!
-Let me go!

264
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:04,318
Why are you grabbing me?
You should arrest him first!

265
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,250
Who's that patient?

266
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,221
The guy who was driving the truck.

267
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,790
They said he hit his chest
against the wheel,

268
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:10,726
but he only has minor injuries.

269
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,803
I've told them time and time again...

270
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,013
...not to bring the victims and the aggressor
to the same hospital.

271
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:18,261
Check his vitals
and take an X-ray of him.

272
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:19,566
Yes, sir.

273
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,515
Let's get him to the X-ray room.

274
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,087
Kill him!
This jerk is the one who did this.

275
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,674
He's the one who made my friends
like this!

276
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,343
Sir, where do you feel pain?

277
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,579
There's no need to treat a jerk
like him!

278
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,400
Just leave him to die!

279
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:38,076
I think I hit my chest,

280
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,256
but I don't really remember.

281
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,685
You don't remember?

282
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,157
Do you know how many people
you've killed?

283
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,596
And yet, you can't remember?

284
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,753
You call yourself a human being,
you jerk?

285
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,830
-Hey!
-Nurse Park, lay him down.

286
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,232
Slowly, now.

287
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,134
What were his vitals when he came in?

288
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,171
His BP was 100/70, with 95 bpm.

289
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,001
What about now?

290
00:18:58,272 --> 00:18:59,912
80/40, with 120 bpm, sir.

291
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:03,035
I told you, this is a murderer!

292
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,236
Please...

293
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,314
Remove this person immediately!

294
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,283
Let me go!
I got hurt because of that jerk!

295
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,854
I'm going to sue you all! Hey!

296
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,447
We've moved the patient
to the X-ray room.

297
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,062
-What does this look like to you?
-What?

298
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,804
Muffled heart sounds.
Distended neck veins.

299
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:29,778
And low arterial blood pressure.

300
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:31,705
That's Beck's triad.

301
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,037
So does this mean
that he has a cardiac tamponade?

302
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,191
But that almost never happens
due to a blunt injury.

303
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,685
That's right.

304
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,922
The chances of this happening due to
a blunt injury is one out of a thousand.

305
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,620
Still, because it's rare,

306
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,875
you didn't consider it
and properly diagnose him?

307
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,130
I apologize, sir.

308
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,466
I didn't consider that
this may have happened.

309
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,702
Well, of course. That's only natural.

310
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,865
You're merely a helper, after all.

311
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,215
Get this patient prepared for surgery...

312
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:11,211
...and find out if they got in touch
with Dr Yang.

313
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:15,782
Helper should just stick to doing work
that is suitable for them.

314
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,455
Yes, sir.

315
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:32,533
Kang Dong-joo, you little brat!
You're done for now!

316
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,284
Yes, this is Kang Dong-joo.

317
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,736
Where are you right now?

318
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,949
Where else would I be
but Doldam Hospital?

319
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:41,045
You're still at the hospital
eventhough it's Saturday afternoon?

320
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,380
I know.

321
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:47,648
This place is so rundown that
I worked all through Friday night...

322
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,665
...and I'm still here eventhough
it's Saturday afternoon.

323
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,486
Let's meet up. When do you have time?

324
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,746
I'm sorry.
I have to go into the OR right now.

325
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:56,823
What?

326
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,894
Oh yeah, were you aware
of this too, Chief?

327
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,582
There's quite a famous surgeon
here at Doldam.

328
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,006
Did... Did you meet that person?

329
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:10,399
Of course.

330
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,374
And that's why I wanted to thank you.

331
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,772
Thank me? What do you mean by that?

332
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:19,186
Because you've introduced me
to quite an amazing mentor.

333
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:22,842
Since things have come to this,
I'll learn all I can before coming back.

334
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,789
Goodbye.

335
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,642
What about the preparations
for the surgery?

336
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,753
All done, sir.

337
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,528
What?

338
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,563
Mentor?

339
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,302
Why, this little...

340
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,134
What? Me?

341
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:45,839
What, you don't want to?

342
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,020
What about you then, Doctor?

343
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,679
Dr Yang is in the OR now, sir.

344
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,385
The patient will be anesthetized
in five minutes.

345
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,945
That other person
has a cardiac tamponade.

346
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,643
I'll take care of that one...

347
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,142
...so you take care of the one
with the internal hemorrhage.

348
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,687
Yes, sir.

349
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,122
Hey.

350
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,558
Don't fall asleep, okay?

351
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,364
Yeah, don't fall asleep. Okay?

352
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,390
We'll get started now.

353
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,258
I'll get started now.

354
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,127
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

355
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,301
"ACS."

356
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:49,570
What does this mean?

357
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:52,458
They say that it's an acronym
for "Association of Cancer Survivors."

358
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:55,432
Does that mean that...

359
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,821
all of the bike riders
are cancer patients?

360
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,144
Yes, more or less.

361
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,562
What about the individuals
who are in surgery right now, then?

362
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,282
Do you know what kind of cancer
they suffer from?

363
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,630
Well, no.
I don't know that much, unfortunately.

364
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:07,128
It's the liver.

365
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,057
They have liver cancer.

366
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:11,925
They even worked so hard
to overcome liver cancer...

367
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,607
...and just barely managed to recover!

368
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:18,697
Liver cancer.

369
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,666
Long forceps.

370
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,069
Scalpel.

371
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,340
Metzenbaum scissors.

372
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,645
Suction.

373
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,182
He's okay for now.

374
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:36,807
Retractor.

375
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,722
Gauze.

376
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,358
Some more, please.

377
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,160
Sternal saw.

378
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,208
Spreader.

379
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,980
Knife.

380
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:10,884
Suction.

381
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,838
So this is the source
of all the hemorrhage.

382
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:24,155
Fortunately, he doesn't seem
to have damaged any major vessels.

383
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,632
I'll stitch him up now. Suture.

384
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,551
-Cut.
-Cut.

385
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:49,890
Focus!

386
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:51,425
Yes, sir.

387
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,526
Pick up the phone!

388
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,742
Doctor. Chief Jang is outside.

389
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,385
You have to pick up! Hurry!

390
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,716
-Cut.
-Cut.

391
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:13,413
Geez, seriously?
So you're making me do this, huh?

392
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:19,308
I told you to pick up your phone,
Teacher Kim!

393
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,662
You know very well that I don't
pick up the phone during surgeries.

394
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,770
This is an emergency situation.

395
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:27,618
The patient over there
has a history of liver cancer.

396
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:29,663
So what?

397
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,920
-Cut.
-Cut.

398
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,468
The patient that was on the table...

399
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:36,139
when Dr Kang got kicked out
of Geosan also had liver cancer!

400
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:46,404
What could this be?

401
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:49,383
He's bleeding, sir.
Where is it coming from?

402
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:50,484
No way.

403
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:54,054
Is it a hepatocellular carcinoma rupture?

404
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,976
What are you doing, Dr Kang?
You have to stop the hemorrhage!

405
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,461
Suction.

406
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,934
There's hemorrhage
in his chest cavity, as well.

407
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,368
At this rate, he'll have a disseminated
intravascular coagulation!

408
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,843
Suction! Go!

409
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,832
The patient has died
due to excessive blood loss.

410
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,632
What's wrong, Dr Kang?

411
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:37,436
What are you doing
in the middle of surgery?

412
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,420
I can't... The hemorrhage won't stop.

413
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:42,803
The hemorrhage won't stop!

414
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:45,739
Get it together, Dr Kang!

415
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:49,178
The only person who can save
this patient now is you, Dr Kang!

416
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:55,415
Dr Kang!

417
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,721
Get it together, Kang Dong-joo!

418
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:09,796
Listen carefully.

419
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:14,902
The patient lying there fully recovered
from liver cancer five years ago.

420
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:17,504
I think he's having a relapse.

421
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,973
He has a hepatocellular carcinoma rupture.

422
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,194
There's too much bleeding.

423
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,944
And due to that,

424
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:27,093
I think that he has
a disseminated intravascular coagulation.

425
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,150
Dr Nam.
How much is the patient bleeding now?

426
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:32,406
It's still observable.

427
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:33,420
Okay.

428
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,418
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!
Are you listening to me?

429
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,994
You'll be the one to call the shots
regarding that surgery.

430
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:43,666
There won't be anyone blaming you...

431
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,025
...even if you decide to call it quits now.

432
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:48,693
But if that happens,

433
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,939
you'll be haunted by this
for the rest of your life.

434
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,644
I'm sorry, sir.

435
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,682
I have no confidence
that I can save this patient.

436
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,798
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!

437
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:04,885
Do you know what makes people freak out

438
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:06,954
more than having a patient
die on their operating table?

439
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,791
It's the thought that
they could've saved that patient...

440
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:15,012
...if they hadn't given up on that surgery,
at that moment.

441
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,164
Those kinds of thoughts
will haunt you forever.

442
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:23,837
Regret drives a person crazier
than failure.

443
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,134
What will you do?

444
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:32,559
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I really don't think I can do it.

445
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,689
You really can't do it?

446
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:45,592
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:47,928
I'm so, so sorry!

448
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,004
Sew him up then.

449
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:58,605
Doctor.

450
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:00,941
If you don't think you can do it,

451
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:04,378
stop bothering that patient
and sew him up.

452
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,332
I told you this already,

453
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,248
but you're the one
in charge of that surgery.

454
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:09,646
Do whatever you want.

455
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,156
Hang up!

456
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:19,801
Cut.

457
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:23,564
Hello?

458
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,698
Teacher Kim!

459
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,967
How could you just hang up
on him like this?

460
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,373
Cut.

461
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:36,413
Geez, really? Teacher Kim!

462
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:37,691
Are you really going to be like this?

463
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,975
Switch spots with me, Nurse Park.

464
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:48,755
Dr Kang.

465
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,394
I've performed many surgical procedures
that were much trickier than this one.

466
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,377
Of course, we've had patients die
on the operating table before...

467
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,413
...but there were more instances in which
the patient stayed with us precisely...

468
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,731
because we tried our best
until the very end.

469
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,042
The patient's condition
isn't really bad right now.

470
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,168
The patient is doing his best
to survive right now.

471
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,991
So what should we do, Dr Kang?

472
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:12,962
Do you really just want to let him die?

473
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:22,508
This is your surgery, Dr Kang.

474
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,663
And we'll follow your orders,
no matter what they may be.

475
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,729
Okay. Suction.

476
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,704
Will you sew him up as is?

477
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:00,027
-Or...
-No.

478
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,055
I'll perform a left hemihepatectomy.

479
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,969
We have plenty of blood,
so don't worry about that.

480
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:12,386
Dr Kang. Give it your all
until the very end.

481
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:14,734
-Suction.
-Suction.

482
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,346
Hemostat.

483
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,648
Vascular clamp.

484
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,022
Suture.

485
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,197
Dr Kang Dong-joo has resumed
his operation!

486
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:47,841
Doctor, Kang Dong-joo has...

487
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,198
-Cut.
-Cut.

488
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,480
Okay.

489
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:55,082
We're done with his heart then.

490
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,217
You finish up the rest.

491
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,851
You can do that much even though
you're just a helper, right?

492
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,953
What?

493
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,755
Yes. Of course.

494
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,325
And don't leave any needles in him.

495
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,094
Of course, sir.

496
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,597
Where are you going, sir?

497
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:13,867
Teacher Kim!

498
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:15,682
Can you apply pressure here, please?

499
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,205
Well, look at this. Great time.

500
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:24,627
You still haven't gotten his hemorrhage
under control?

501
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,805
We're doing it now.

502
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:28,518
It's late but do you still want me
to help you?

503
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:31,043
No, I'll do it. Gouge.

504
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,287
Gauze.

505
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:40,794
Irrigation.

506
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:43,830
Suction.

507
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,502
I'll sew the left hepatic artery
and the portal vein together.

508
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,003
Hemostat..

509
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,408
Suture.

510
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,246
Cut.

511
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,796
I'll be doing a lobectomy now. Gouge.

512
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,294
He's started bleeding again.

513
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,895
The veins I sewed together
haven't separated though.

514
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,152
What about the hepatic vein?

515
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:26,929
I'm planning to do a resection
and ligation.

516
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,843
Doesn't it stop the bleeding as long
as I get the inflow under control?

517
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:30,980
No.

518
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:34,181
There could always be backflow
because the vein was bleeding before.

519
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,115
It's probably that.

520
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,581
You have to block off
the hepatic vein first.

521
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:40,787
Yes, sir.

522
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:41,989
Hemostat.

523
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,292
Hold on to that.

524
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,261
Suture.

525
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:49,696
Suction.

526
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:57,738
Cut.

527
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:00,574
Irrigation.

528
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:04,478
Suction.

529
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,613
Gauze.

530
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:15,422
I think we've got it under control, sir.

531
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,573
Dr Nam. How is he?

532
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,165
His vitals are at 90/50,
and his heart rate is stabilizing.

533
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,367
Okay.

534
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,073
Hey, what are you doing?

535
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,043
You have to finish the resection.

536
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,477
Yes, sir.

537
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,656
-I'll be right up.
-Okay.

538
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:50,958
How did it go?

539
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,395
It was quite a touching collaboration.

540
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,274
So Dr Kang took a good care of it, right?

541
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:00,601
That's not all, though.

542
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,745
Seeing him stop the hemorrhage...

543
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:06,127
...with Teacher Kim was like a scene
straight out of a movie!

544
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:09,910
I guess there's a reason he passed
the board exam with the highest marks.

545
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:11,411
Right?

546
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:37,604
What?

547
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,206
Jeongseon? Did you mean today, sir?

548
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:44,218
Yeah. I thought you said that
you were close with Kang Dong-joo.

549
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,112
I'm planning to go down there...

550
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,998
...and have a drink with him today
so make it happen for us.

551
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,732
Chief Song. I have a day off
for the first time in a long time

552
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:53,950
so I already promised my wife and kid
that I'd go to the aquarium with them.

553
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,055
So?

554
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,205
I guess I'll have to push that back a bit,
then, right?

555
00:35:58,272 --> 00:35:59,156
I have to go, right?

556
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,276
Yes, let me call my wife.

557
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,563
Can I come with you, sir?

558
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:06,700
You too?

559
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,502
Do you know Kang Dong-joo well?

560
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:11,438
-We went to the same school.
-Really?

561
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,442
That's great.
It will be better with the three of us!

562
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:16,581
I'll see you both in the parking lot
in 30 minutes.

563
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:17,678
Yes, sir!

564
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,347
The surgical department should take
care of their own business!

565
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,083
Why does he keep dragging me
into this when I work in the ER?

566
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,853
Isn't this abuse of power?

567
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:29,289
Didn't you say that the person called
"Crazy Whale" was there, too?

568
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:30,991
He said that he wanted
to get drinks there.

569
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:32,593
Oh yeah, Seo-Jung.

570
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:33,927
You're right.

571
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,231
Hello, I'm Lee Joon-hee
a reporter from SBN.

572
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:44,680
Can you give us a detailed briefing
about the accident that occurred today?

573
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:48,308
Yes, regarding our Doldam Hospital...

574
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,778
Can you tell us how many casualties
and injuries there were first...

575
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,780
I'm doing that right now, aren't I?

576
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:57,110
Yes, regarding our Doldam Hospital...

577
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:59,553
firstly, we have a new surgeon
at our hospital

578
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,723
who graduated with the highest score

579
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,526
on the national board exam to
earn his specialization.

580
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,761
He's a skilled young man. Therefore...

581
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:27,681
What were you going to do

582
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,484
if I'd given up, sir?

583
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:40,394
What if I'd really given up right
then and there?

584
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,630
I wasn't going to do anything, really.

585
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:45,566
Nothing at all?

586
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:48,869
It wouldn't be my fault that
a patient died because you gave up.

587
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,870
And if you lived in guilt and regret,

588
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:55,409
haunted by that moment forever that
would've been your problem.

589
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:56,561
I'm saying this...

590
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:01,081
...because I really don't get it,

591
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:06,777
but can I ask you why you wanted me
to stay behind at this hospital?

592
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:08,604
When did I ever do that?

593
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:11,180
Then, why did you say that back then?

594
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,695
If you don't change, nothing else will.

595
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,296
Got that?

596
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,832
Weren't you aware of the fact
that I'd recognize you...

597
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:25,435
...if you said that and that
I'd stay here because of it?

598
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:29,576
So is that why you were acting so weird?

599
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:31,378
Weird?

600
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,247
Hey.

601
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,149
Why didn't you do a CT scan on
that patient?

602
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,452
If you had,

603
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,021
you would've been able to catch
the HCC rupture.

604
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:44,925
I thought that something worse
would happen if I wasted time...

605
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,394
So you didn't even check
the patient's medical history

606
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:48,695
before putting them in the operating room?

607
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:50,230
His chest was dilating

608
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:52,933
and I thought that he'd have
a heart attack if I stalled any longer.

609
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,670
It was my mistake that I didn't check
the patient's medical history...

610
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,972
but at any rate,
it was an emergency situation

611
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,407
and our first priority was to stop
the hemorrhage

612
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:01,842
we'd seen on the ultrasound.

613
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,377
That's my method, though.

614
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,913
That's not your style, Kang Dong-joo!

615
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:09,283
Hey, I thought you were a stickler
for rules.

616
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:15,055
Aren't rules supposed to apply all
across the board, despite the situation?

617
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:16,823
Changing your method based on

618
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,327
the other person's preference or
the situation isn't going by the book.

619
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,595
That's not orthodox.

620
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,630
I was just being a bit more flexible.

621
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,148
It wasn't just that you almost killed
a patient...

622
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,837
...because you were trying
to cater to your tastes?

623
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:34,374
Aren't you being too hard on me
for a single mistake I made?

624
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,009
Stop making excuses for yourself.

625
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:39,012
That one mistake almost cost
someone his life.

626
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:43,217
Whether you leave or stay
is your business,

627
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:44,418
so do whatever you want.

628
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:50,324
But if you're expecting something
of me, wake up.

629
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:55,462
All I have to offer someone who changes
his principles based on the situation

630
00:39:55,529 --> 00:40:00,501
is contempt, scorn,
and whole lot of insults.

631
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,711
I told you.

632
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:46,547
I said that he was quite
a prickly person, didn't I?

633
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,383
And that he wouldn't be easy to win over.

634
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,491
But you know...

635
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,763
I'm still kind of jealous of you.

636
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:07,668
Today, you did what I've wanted to do...

637
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:10,938
...for the past five years.

638
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,842
You did a co-surgery with Teacher Kim.

639
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:18,879
It wasn't a co-surgery.
He intervened in my surgery.

640
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,747
And on top of that,

641
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,116
he showed you all the mistakes
that you made.

642
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,552
He didn't point them out.
That was his way of looking down on me.

643
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,356
I wish he'd look down on me
like that too, then.

644
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,094
That'd be better than having him be
totally apathetic toward me.

645
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:37,364
That's my wish.

646
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,970
In my opinion, he has a serious
personality problem.

647
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,306
A sadist that enjoys pissing
other people off.

648
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:49,910
Or it could be because of his own wounds.

649
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,781
The fact that someone as incredible
as him disowned his own name...

650
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:58,218
...and is hiding in a place like this...

651
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,822
Means that there must be a reason...

652
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,423
...and a deep wound related to that.

653
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:33,954
Who said that you could perform
that surgery, you jerk?

654
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,175
Huh? Who was it?

655
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,692
-Who the heck gave you the right?
-Doctor!

656
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:43,028
-Let go of me!
-Doctor!

657
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:45,999
Okay, okay, fine. Let go. You jerk!

658
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,131
Doctor!

659
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,236
Doctor! Please!

660
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,440
Let go of me!

661
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:56,883
Was it you?

662
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:01,105
Did you tell him to enter
that operating room?

663
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:02,516
What are you talking about?

664
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:04,417
You're the one who killed her.

665
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:07,855
What?

666
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:11,087
You were the one who barged in there...

667
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,559
...and knocked over the table.

668
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,095
That's what it'll say on
your surgical record.

669
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:18,799
And that's how the staff will testify,
too.

670
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:20,667
Dr Bu Yong-ju.

671
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:25,873
Nobody who was in that OR
will be on your side.

672
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:40,520
So why didn't you just wag your tail

673
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:43,357
and accept what we gave you
when we showered you with affection?

674
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,560
How dare you raise your head
and bark at me?

675
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,162
I'm the one who made you into
who you are now.

676
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:54,134
It's not too late, you know.
Get on your knees and beg.

677
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,003
If you do, I can find it in me to
forgive you this once...

678
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,237
Jang Hyun-joo...

679
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,544
It was her dream to listen to Madonna
in the operating room...

680
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,314
and hold a scalpel in her hand.

681
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:08,415
That was the dream of that high

682
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,950
school senior who was on her way
to medical school!

683
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,754
Her wish would have been granted...

684
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,291
...if she'd been transferred
to the internal medicine department...

685
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:20,861
...and treated with medication.

686
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:25,632
She shouldn't have died
because of a jerk like you.

687
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,600
You got that?

688
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,642
Kneel?

689
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,544
You go and kneel in front
of that child's mother, you jerk.

690
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,108
You won't ever be able to come
back to Geosan University Hospital.

691
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,519
And not just Geosan!

692
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:48,015
There won't be a single hospital...

693
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,290
...in this country that will take you,
Bu Yong-ju.

694
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:55,729
I will make sure that you never get
a job in this field ever again!

695
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:58,198
I will!

696
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,802
I will!

697
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:37,371
I think this is it, sir.

698
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,606
So this is Doldam Hospital?

699
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,476
Geez, it’s so small...

700
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:44,311
-Call him.
-Excuse me?

701
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:46,847
Call Kang Dong-joo.

702
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,215
Oh, yes, sir.

703
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,127
Um, should I wake up, ma'am?

704
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,496
He was on duty last night
and even performed a surgery today.

705
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:03,997
So I'm sure that he's quite tired.

706
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:07,734
He needs to get some shuteye.
Just let him be.

707
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:08,769
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:12,401
He's not picking up, sir.

709
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,431
He's not?
But his phone is ringing, right?

710
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:15,876
Yes, but he's not picking up.

711
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,246
But he wouldn't be here.
It's Saturday afternoon, after all.

712
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,180
I'm sure he is.

713
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,748
He told me that he was heading
into the OR before.

714
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,250
Then I guess he's in the middle
of surgery.

715
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,920
Hey, think before you speak!

716
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:30,157
You think a long, large-scale surgery
would be possible at a place like this?

717
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:32,159
No, I think that it is impossible, sir.

718
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:34,427
I'll go and look for him.

719
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:35,462
Will you?

720
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:46,240
Yes! I'll go and look for him, as well!

721
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:53,918
Did you get hurt?

722
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,015
I almost did!

723
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,783
What were you planning to do
if I did get hurt?

724
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,045
Are you a pianist?

725
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:02,155
I'm a doctor.

726
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,396
Are you a surgeon?

727
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:10,063
Aren't you going to apologize?

728
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,023
You said you weren't hurt.

729
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,814
I told you, I almost was!

730
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,769
Exactly, so be careful!

731
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,510
Hey, what's up?

732
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:24,511
Did something happen?

733
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:27,451
No, it's nothing.
Just some darned psycho.

734
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,348
Psycho?

735
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:31,318
Hey In-Bum. Wait for me!

736
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:48,320
It's me, Mr Director.

737
00:47:48,386 --> 00:47:50,971
I'm in Jeongseon right now.

738
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,854
And it's definitely Bu Yong-ju!

739
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:54,842
I just saw him myself.

740
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:00,514
That rat...

741
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,649
That rat...

742
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,221
So he was hiding in a place
like this all along?

743
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:22,669
Chief Jang...

744
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,105
You must be quite exhausted.

745
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,040
Of course you would be.

746
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,404
Please, have this.

747
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:33,082
No, it's fine.

748
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:34,617
I don't really like things like that.

749
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:35,716
Is that right, sir?

750
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:38,942
You have guests.

751
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:41,488
Must be dry
because we're in the mountains.

752
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:42,689
It is, isn't it?

753
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:46,693
In-soo!

754
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,253
Dong-joo. Hey, Dong-joo!

755
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:52,799
What brings you here?

756
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,161
What else, man? I came to see you!

757
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:57,958
Hey, it hasn't even been a week
since you've been here.

758
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,729
But it feels like it's been
a year already!

759
00:49:00,796 --> 00:49:02,135
You're really here to see me?

760
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,645
Of course I am!

761
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:06,380
In-bum is here, too.

762
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:09,316
Do In-bum?

763
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,222
What brings you here?

764
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,293
I didn't know you were here
before heading over.

765
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,161
I asked you why you're here.

766
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,767
I'm here to see... that guy,
Kang Dong-joo.

767
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,435
I really treasure him, you see.

768
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:31,538
If you really treasure him, why did
you send him to this wretched place?

769
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:33,040
You should've kept him
by your side instead.

770
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,575
You know how Director Do is.

771
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:36,777
He loves blaming others for things.

772
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:38,679
Hey.

773
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,984
Are you still living your life like that?

774
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:46,687
Why are you acting like this?

775
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:49,189
I'm the chief of the surgical
department now.

776
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:53,527
Know your place! What do you take me for?

777
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:56,330
So why would someone with such
a high rank like yourself bother hauling

778
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:59,233
your ass over here,
only to hide in the car?

779
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,434
Well, my back...

780
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:04,271
it just hurts a little,
so I was lying down for a bit.

781
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,807
You sure you weren't hiding
because you did something so shameful?

782
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:09,710
Hey, watch your words!

783
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:13,280
I'm not the same Song Hyun-chul
I was before!

784
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:16,016
I'm the chief of the surgical department
at Geosan University Hospital!

785
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,317
Exactly!

786
00:50:18,552 --> 00:50:22,322
Why the heck did you come here
when you're the chief there now?

787
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:23,891
Don't use Kang Dong-joo as an excuse!

788
00:50:23,957 --> 00:50:25,259
Give me your real reason!

789
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:28,595
I don't know why he dragged us down here.

790
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,764
He told me that he just wanted to
have a drink with you.

791
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:32,533
No, I can't go now.

792
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,401
I have to wait until the patient
I performed surgery on wakes up.

793
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:35,369
Hey!

794
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,839
Come out just for a bit.
The chief is even here.

795
00:50:41,508 --> 00:50:42,676
Yes, this is Kang Dong-joo.

796
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:45,612
Yes, I understand.
I'll be there right away.

797
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,814
I have to go now.
There's a patient in the ER.

798
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,983
Why would a general surgeon
like you go to the ER?

799
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,686
They're short-staffed here, so they
have to use whoever's around.

800
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,721
Talk to the chief for me, okay?

801
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:57,324
Hey, Dong-joo. Dong-joo!

802
00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:01,728
Man, this is driving me crazy.
What do I do now?

803
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:05,499
And why isn't In-bum picking up
his phone?

804
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,367
Where did he disappear to?

805
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:17,878
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

806
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:20,113
She's probably getting sheets right now.

807
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,215
Sheets?

808
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:25,018
Doctors even do tasks like that
at this hospital?

809
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:28,922
Well... such is the situation right now.

810
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,194
Despite everything, this is really unfair.

811
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:37,898
I passed the EM board exam and
studied to pass the bar in CS, after all.

812
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:41,335
And yet, I have to be here
folding sheets?

813
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:45,672
What can I do, though? I'm a helper now.

814
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,643
Why are you screaming? Why?

815
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:24,545
Because you surprised me, obviously!

816
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:26,813
Who are you?

817
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,615
Who are you that you're standing there?

818
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:32,786
Um, I... just lost my way.

819
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:34,555
What?

820
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:39,459
Someone called the paramedics

821
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:41,395
after seeing her passed out on the street
and she was brought here.

822
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:42,663
Her pupils' reaction time is slow and

823
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,431
her self-respiration is weak

824
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:45,899
so let's intubate her first.

825
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:47,835
Can you put a line in her,
and give her some normal saline?

826
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:48,936
And do a CT scan of her brain.

827
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,003
Wait.

828
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:01,915
Give this patient something to eat.

829
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:03,150
Eat?

830
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:05,285
What?

831
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,887
I said 'Give this patient
something to eat'.

832
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:09,756
Nurse Oh. What are you...

833
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:11,091
Just trust me, Dr Kang.

834
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:12,626
She needs food.

835
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:18,432
If you take that emergency staircase,
it'll take you straight to the lobby.

836
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:21,134
Make sure you take a right turn
there, and not a left turn.

837
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:23,070
Oh, I see.

838
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:25,239
Okay. Goodbye.

839
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:29,443
Geez, this won't do.

840
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,745
I'll have to send this back
to get washed.

841
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:34,915
By any chance...

842
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:36,416
Yes?

843
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:40,487
Do you know the person they call
"Crazy Whale"?

844
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:53,400
Have something to eat!
Here, get up and eat!

845
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:56,236
This won't do.
We should put a line in her now.

846
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:09,783
Eat slowly. Slowly.

847
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,084
If you eat too fast,
you'll get indigestion.

848
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,953
Chew your food thoroughly,
and eat slowly.

849
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:16,290
We get homeless people

850
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:19,359
who have been starving for days sent to us
from near the casino quite often.

851
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:22,429
Oh... I see.

852
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,041
Drink it.

853
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:50,524
Well, take your time eating that, then.

854
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:04,538
Tell Nurse Park if you need anything.

855
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,442
Hello, I'm Park Eun-tak.

856
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:24,525
-Doctor.
-Yes?

857
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,360
Do you know where Dr Yoon
Seo-Jung is, by any chance?

858
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:27,361
The supply room.

859
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:28,595
Thank you.

860
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:35,102
How do you know "Crazy Whale"?

861
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:38,739
I heard a lot about her.

862
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:40,274
Apparently, she was legendary at Geosan.

863
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,776
And I heard that she was here.

864
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,545
So I was wondering what kind of
person she was.

865
00:55:45,212 --> 00:55:47,114
Do you know her, by any chance?

866
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,285
Yes, I do.

867
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:55,656
It's me.

868
00:55:57,257 --> 00:55:59,893
Oh, I see.

869
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:04,498
So you're Crazy Whale.

870
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:07,601
But who are you?

871
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:09,503
I'm sure you didn't come all this way

872
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,238
just because you were curious about that.

873
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:12,406
So why are you here?

874
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:16,810
Hey, Do In-bum!

875
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:25,219
What are you doing here?

876
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:27,287
Nothing much.

877
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,389
I was just looking around and got lost.

878
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:31,258
Wait, you two know each other?

879
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:32,826
Who is this guy?

880
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,064
We went to the same school and were
both general surgeons at Geosan.

881
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:40,868
Someone from a different caste system
even though I'm far more skilled.

882
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,603
Someone from a different caste system?

883
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:44,404
Is the director doing well?

884
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:47,774
Does he feel good about himself
after sending me to this place?

885
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,476
What are you saying?

886
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,245
Say this in a way that I'll understand!

887
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:56,183
Director Do Yoon-wan is his dad.

888
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,826
Why won't you answer me?

889
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:08,295
What is the real reason
behind your visit here?

890
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:14,301
I heard that the chairman of the board
asked you to do his surgery.

891
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:18,238
What?

892
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,774
-Who?
-Chairman Shin Myung-ho.

893
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:21,942
The owner of the casino.

894
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:25,012
He's the chairman of the board
at Geosan University Hospital.

895
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:43,063
There isn't much time left before
the director gets his position renewed.

896
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:47,634
The person who has the most say
in that decision is Chairman Shin!

897
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,977
But he says that he wants you,
of all people, to perform surgery on him!

898
00:57:51,043 --> 00:57:53,625
So you think Director Do would just
sit and watch, with that temper of his?

899
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,343
It'd be best for you to just give up
on doing that surgery altogether.

900
00:57:58,011 --> 00:58:00,747
If you don't, you'll just end up
getting hurt again!

901
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:05,219
He'll do anything to make sure
you can't perform that surgery!

902
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:07,321
Do Yoon-wan will do anything he can!

903
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:29,743
Man, what kind of darned twist
of fate is this?

904
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,669
Romatic Doctor, Teacher Kim

905
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,661
-What are we supposed to do, then?
-Neither I nor Teacher Kim is there.

906
00:58:47,728 --> 00:58:48,996
The only person at the ER now is you.

907
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:49,930
Are you just going to let the patient die?

908
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:50,998
We can't stall for any more time.

909
00:58:51,064 --> 00:58:54,034
How dare a helper make such a decision?

910
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:54,968
I'm sorry, sir.

911
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:56,703
Are you the one who operated
on my big brother?

912
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,805
I really, truly am sorry
for everything, but...

913
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,408
If you don't perform a surgery now,
that patient could die!

914
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:02,342
Aren't you a doctor?

915
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:05,679
If I were to go back to that moment,
I would've made the same decision.

916
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:09,816
Because I'm a doctor, whether or not
you acknowledge me as such.
