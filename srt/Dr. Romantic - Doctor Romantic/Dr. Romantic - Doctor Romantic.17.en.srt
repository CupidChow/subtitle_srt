1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,673
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,690
This is the artery.

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,827
It looks weak,
so be careful when pulling on it.

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:27,995
Yes, Doctor.

5
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:47,848
Teacher Kim.

6
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,616
His systolic blood pressure
is falling to 60,

7
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,752
and his oximeter reading
is falling under 40.

8
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,520
I'll decrease the volume
and give him a transfusion.

9
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:54,588
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,256
I'm so sorry, Doctor!

11
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,224
It's okay.

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,325
Don't freak out.

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,027
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,528
Suture No 4.

15
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,217
Doctor!

16
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,618
We have an emergency patient.

17
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,220
You should come with me.

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,289
I think it may be an ulcer perforation.

19
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,924
An ulcer perforation?

20
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,061
Is that how they taught you to
relay a patient's condition?

21
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,896
Where did you receive such training?

22
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:36,964
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,599
The patient is a 34-year-old male.

24
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,734
He's had chronic stomach pains
since Wednesday,

25
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,403
and came to receive treatment this morning
due to severe pain.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,572
He has no medical history worth
mentioning and as for his ROS...

27
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,317
Are you doing a presentation,
or something?

28
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,042
So how is his current state?

29
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,713
He has rigidity all over his abdomen
and has quite a bit of tenderness.

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,149
There wasn't anything that came up
on the x-rays, so we did a CT scan.

31
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,719
Here it is.

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,390
Yeah? How did it go?

33
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,725
It definitely is an ulcer perforation.

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,993
We'll have to operate immediately.

35
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:06,960
How are things over there?

36
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,395
Did they start the cannulation?

37
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,197
No, not yet...

38
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,466
Okay, I'll take care of the patient
with the perforation for now...

39
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,433
...and you take care of things over there.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,302
I can't take care of the controller,
the battery,

41
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,004
and the sutures in 20 minutes by myself.

42
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,874
We've lost 10 minutes already because
they had to stitch up the artery.

43
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,310
We can't waste any more time.

44
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,312
This patient
can't hold on much longer, either.

45
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,714
If something goes wrong,
he can possibly get sepsis.

46
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,950
They're still in the process of
removing some blood vessels,

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:34,855
so we'll have about an hour and 10,
no... 20 minutes...

48
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:38,659
...after they finish the cannulation
and start the heart lung machine.

49
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,194
What do you mean?

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,730
Can't we take care
of an ulcer perforation in that time?

51
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,332
The two of us.

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,268
Should we do a laparoscopy
or an open surgery?

53
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,070
If we can see the tear
as soon as we start,

54
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,672
it'll be faster to do a laparoscopy,

55
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,240
but if we can't see it,

56
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,209
it'd be faster to find it through
open surgery.

57
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,477
Time isn't really on our side right now,
after all.

58
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,213
Okay.

59
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,347
If we need to do
an open surgery, you do it.

60
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,254
Sure.

61
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,851
-Nurse Uhm.
-Yes?

62
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,119
Dr Yang from Jungil Hospital is on
standby today, right?

63
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,588
Yes, he should be in the staff room.

64
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,790
Please tell him we have
an emergency ulcer perforation surgery.

65
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,691
Yes, Doctor.

66
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,059
-Dr Woo Yeon-hwa.
-Yes?

67
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,861
Get the patient to the OR immediately.

68
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,928
Yes, Doctor.

69
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,798
Yes, this is the OR.

70
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,233
Just listen.

71
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,568
There's a patient who came in
with an ulcer perforation,

72
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,195
so we'll be going into surgery shortly.

73
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,839
Don't tell Teacher Kim.

74
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,876
We'll finish and come back
before he starts the heart-lung machine.

75
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,180
Just keep me updated
every 10 minutes on his progress.

76
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,682
Yes, Doctor.

77
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,717
I will.

78
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,072
May I begin?

79
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,941
Yes, go ahead.

80
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,677
Scalpel.

81
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,923
Gauze.

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,257
Gouge.

83
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,563
Kelly forceps.

84
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,168
Scalpel.

85
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,571
Retractor.

86
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:34,975
Irrigation, please.

87
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,279
More, please.

88
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,685
Dr Nam.

89
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,353
Give him piperine.

90
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,788
Injecting it now.

91
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,625
CANNULATION HAS BEGUN

92
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,127
They've started the cannulation.

93
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,897
Can you see it?

94
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,000
I think it's near the lesser curvature.

95
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,135
Gouge.

96
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,207
No 4 sutures.

97
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,455
Cut.

98
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,597
Knife.

99
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,132
And cannula.

100
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,599
Yoon Seo-Jung. Clamp.

101
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,435
Okay, sutures.

102
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,844
Cut.

103
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,113
Suction on the right side.

104
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,020
Irrigation.

105
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,118
A bit more irrigation.

106
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,657
There we go.

107
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,992
Take the clamp off.

108
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,068
Let's take care of
the inferior vena cava now.

109
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,269
Yes, sir.

110
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,047
He really is skilled, huh?

111
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,252
Hey Chief Shin.

112
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,187
How are things looking to you?

113
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,788
Is everything okay so far?

114
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:05,025
Yes, he's been moving at a steady pace.

115
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,095
But he really is fast.

116
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,163
It's only been 1 hour and 25 minutes,

117
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,499
and he's done working on
the inferior vena cava.

118
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,601
I'm sure that he'll
do something absurd to...

119
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,571
...shorten the duration of the surgery.

120
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,640
You mustn't let it escape your notice.

121
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,574
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,152
I found it.

123
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,320
Sutures, please.

124
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,336
Cut.

125
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,445
-Cut.
-Cut.

126
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,117
-Cut.
-Cut.

127
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,119
-Cut.
-Cut.

128
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,362
-Cut.
-Cut.

129
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,396
Cut.

130
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,611
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA CANNULATION HAS BEGUN.

131
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:21,668
Doctor!

132
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,338
Teacher Kim has just finished
cannulating the inferior vena cava,

133
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,644
and is now working on cannulating
the superior vena cava.

134
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,186
We're going to be short on time
at this rate.

135
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,116
Cut.

136
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,517
Okay.

137
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,680
Cut.

138
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:44,825
Cut.

139
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,161
Okay.

140
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,068
There we go.

141
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,231
We'll irrigate him for the
next 10 minutes and finish up.

142
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,533
We'll close him up
within 10 minutes, too.

143
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,567
Irrigation.

144
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,243
Gauze.

145
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,806
Hemovac, please.

146
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,976
Doctor!

147
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,116
They said you'll need
to be there within 10 minutes!

148
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,052
Sutures.

149
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,147
Are we using skin staplers?

150
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,048
Yeah.

151
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,350
We'll get the subcutaneous layer
to maintain as much...

152
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,620
...tension as possible
and then use skin staplers.

153
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,596
-Cut.
-Cut

154
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,602
Doctor, they said you two need
to be over there now!

155
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,771
Cut.

156
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,039
Cut.

157
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,307
Stapler.

158
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,818
Okay.

159
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,087
Yeon-hwa, we'll leave the dressing
and the rest to you.

160
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,222
Yes, Doctor.

161
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,723
Follow up with him
until he gets into the ICU.

162
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,024
If something happens, call immediately.

163
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,259
Yes, Doctor.

164
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,753
Is the heart-lung machine ready?

165
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,976
Yes, it is.

166
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,077
Pump on.

167
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,914
-Ready?
-Yeah.

168
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,248
Decrease the pump flow.

169
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,518
Clasp clamp.

170
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,190
Increase the pump flow.

171
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,806
Turn the artificial heart off.

172
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,513
We'll now be removing
the artificial heart.

173
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,015
Kang Dong-joo, Do In-bum. Okay?

174
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,050
Yes.

175
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,484
Position change!

176
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,760
We'll be removing the battery,
the TET, and the controller.

177
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,828
Scalpel.

178
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,969
Gouge.

179
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:50,777
Geez, Dr Do In-bum sure
looks great on screen, too, Director.

180
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,951
Arm retractor.

181
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,119
One more.

182
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,274
Do you need coffee?

183
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,508
Or another beverage?

184
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,709
Or sandwich?

185
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,545
Where's the bathroom?

186
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,315
Oh, please go straight then turn left.

187
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,517
And then make a right.

188
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,952
Thank you.

189
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,361
OFFICE OF CHIEF OF SURGICAL
DEPARTMENT TEACHER KIM

190
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:15,362
Dr Bu Yong-joo is really
giving it his all, isn't he?

191
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,811
I've finished removing the battery.

192
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,914
The controller has been removed as well.

193
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,349
I'll be taking out the TET now.

194
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, nice.

195
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,029
You two saved us 2 minutes of time.

196
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,966
Good job, both of you.

197
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,468
Metzenbaum scissors.

198
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,739
We'll be going at this
without any breaks now.

199
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,525
Geez, this is amazing.

200
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,812
Isn't it incredible?

201
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,814
I don't know much since
I'm not a doctor myself,

202
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:18,952
but I do feel that
this is truly incredible.

203
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,755
What's your position at this hospital?

204
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:25,092
Oh, I'm the Section Chief of
Administration at Doldam Hospital.

205
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,793
My name is Jang Ki-tae.

206
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,666
Oh, then that means there's nothing
you don't know about this place.

207
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,906
It's a bit awkward of me to
say this about myself,

208
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:43,277
but I hold a lot more influence here
than people realize.

209
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,447
Oh, I see!

210
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,629
Give us the connector for the new unit.

211
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,964
Long forceps.

212
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,973
Suture No 4, please.

213
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,427
The artificial heart, please.

214
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,413
How much compressed air is there?

215
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,615
5.8 liters.

216
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,084
I'll be disposing of the air
in the artificial heart now.

217
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,952
Please give the heart some volume.

218
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,757
Please turn on the artificial heart.

219
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,783
How does this make any sense?

220
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,453
What, did you notice a mistake?

221
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,255
No, that's not it.

222
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,593
He hasn't deviated from the way
procedures to be done, not even once.

223
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,395
The only abnormal thing was...

224
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,930
Yes?

225
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:17,965
What was it?

226
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:22,202
He was too... fast.

227
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,570
Too fast?

228
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,406
It takes at least three to fours hours...

229
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,710
...to put the pump on with
so much coalescence.

230
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,280
But he only took four hours
and five minutes...

231
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:35,892
...to do that and install the new unit.

232
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,751
-This really is...
-Is that all?

233
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,253
There was nothing else?

234
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,122
-There was one more thing.
-What is it?

235
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,223
Hurry up and tell me.

236
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:50,230
It was too perfectly done.

237
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:16,256
So his skills haven't gotten rusty at all.

238
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,099
Yoon Seo-Jung?

239
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,102
Try touching it.

240
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,271
Me?

241
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:03,170
This is the first artificial heart
you've transplanted into someone.

242
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:44,578
The surgery continued on
for two more hours after that,

243
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,647
including the hemostasis and sutures.

244
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,284
And the total time it took to
complete the surgery...

245
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,387
...was six hours and two minutes.

246
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,824
Six hours and two minutes.

247
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,863
You've all done a great job, everyone.

248
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,764
Good job.

249
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,665
Good job.

250
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,333
Good job.

251
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,437
All right.

252
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,540
Good job, Dr Nam.

253
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,380
-Good job!
-Good job.

254
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:46,340
Thus, Teacher Kim and we...

255
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:49,877
...created another miracle.

256
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,275
EPISODE 17 Moment of Truth

257
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,414
You're here, ma'am?

258
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:28,448
How is Father?

259
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,384
He's inside, resting.

260
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,020
The surgery seemed to be successful.

261
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,555
During the procedure,

262
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:37,024
they made a mistake and ruptured a vein,

263
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,928
so we need to continue to monitor
the chairman's recovery.

264
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,301
He's doing quite well.

265
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,671
His BP, CVP, ABGA,
and VBGA are all stable.

266
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,808
How is the patient
who had the ulcer perforation?

267
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,244
Kang Dong-joo came by
to check on him just a moment ago.

268
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,779
I think that his surgery went well.

269
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:02,983
Make sure you visit the chairman
consistently until he wakes up,

270
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,420
and call me if anything happens.

271
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,921
I'll stay by his side.

272
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:11,425
I'll stay with him too,
so don't worry too much.

273
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:14,006
I'll leave it to you, then.

274
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:14,967
Yeah.

275
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,263
Yes, Doctor.

276
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,000
How's my father doing?

277
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,802
He's fine.

278
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,605
And all of his vitals are stable.

279
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:29,810
It will take approximately
six to 12 hours for him to wake up.

280
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,046
He'll be up late tonight
or early tomorrow.

281
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,317
It seemed that you ruptured
his artery by accident.

282
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:43,257
I don't think you realize this since
your specialty is internal medicine,

283
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:45,225
but it's possible to rupture an artery
while working on...

284
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:48,028
...a severely coalesced sternum.

285
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,565
You even brought yourself
a cardiothoracic specialist here.

286
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,667
He didn't even explain that to you?

287
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:58,605
I know that the oxygen going to
his brain fell to 40 because of that.

288
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:02,676
That's not that bad, considering
the average is about 38 in those cases,

289
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,312
and he recovered quickly after that.

290
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:09,149
If he develops any brain problems
due to your little mishap...

291
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,520
There's almost no chance of
that happening, Director Do.

292
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,389
You'd better hope that that won't happen.

293
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,469
If you don't want the situation to
get out of hand for you, that is.

294
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,496
Geez, you might as well go
and say some prayers...

295
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,832
that he'll never wake up.

296
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,135
How could you say such a thing?

297
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,270
I'm just worrying about the chairman!

298
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,707
Sure you are.

299
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,913
Goodbye, then.

300
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:48,622
Please don't misunderstand.

301
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,524
I truly was worried for the chairman.

302
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,525
I know.

303
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,760
Anyways, good job.

304
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,664
Call me as soon as the chairman wakes up.

305
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,299
I'll be at the hotel.

306
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:01,134
You're not going inside, ma'am?

307
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,107
I don't really want to see my father
in a weak and unhealthy state.

308
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,347
Call me when he wakes up.

309
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:42,509
I think that the surgery
went quite well, Mr Chairman.

310
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:51,118
I did make a mistake
during the surgery...

311
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,322
...but Teacher Kim took care of it
perfectly for me,

312
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,024
so there weren't any other problems.

313
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:02,529
You'll recover quickly,
just as long as you don't give up.

314
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,400
Okay?

315
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,127
Doctor!

316
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,529
We have a few questions!

317
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,898
Please, just one question!

318
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:41,034
Please, Doctor!

319
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,236
May I have some of your time, please?

320
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:43,270
Please calm down, everyone.

321
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:46,840
Our Teacher Kim completed
quite a difficult surgery today,

322
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:50,143
so I'd like to extend my apologies
as he won't be able to see you.

323
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,945
Please return to your seats now.

324
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:52,880
Please.

325
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,182
Doctor! Just one question!

326
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,352
Alright, I'll contact him,
so please return to your seats.

327
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:08,996
Yes?

328
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,869
I'm sorry to be bothering you
while you're resting, Teacher Kim.

329
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,471
What's this about?

330
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:21,708
Firstly, I'd like to congratulate you
on your successful surgery.

331
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,778
That was quite a remarkable live surgery.

332
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,981
You really showed how great you are!

333
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:32,219
So, what's this about?

334
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:35,022
Well, that is...

335
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:39,993
There's someone who wanted to
do a special feature on you...

336
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,196
...due to this remarkable
transplant surgery you performed.

337
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:43,597
I'm not doing it.

338
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,598
Don't be like that.

339
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:49,102
We have to focus on our PR marketing
for your sake now, and for Doldam's...

340
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,005
I told you,
I'm not meeting with a reporter.

341
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:54,141
Oh, hello!

342
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,576
I'm sorry that a mere reporter,
such as myself...

343
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:57,711
...is infringing on your precious time.

344
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:58,612
Reporter Oh.

345
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,948
You said you'd come in
when I gave you the signal.

346
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,616
You can't just barge in here!

347
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,821
It's been a while, Dr Bu Yong-joo.

348
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,550
It's the first time we've seen each other
since the Jang Hyun-joo incident, huh?

349
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,312
What's the matter?

350
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,047
I think he has an infection.

351
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,682
His temperature is 102.4.

352
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,484
Nurse Jo!

353
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,787
Can you check this patient's vitals
and give him some propacetamol?

354
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:42,189
Yes, Doctor.

355
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:43,857
Go downstairs and have something to eat.

356
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,659
I'll take care of things here.

357
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:46,760
It's okay, Doctor.

358
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:49,563
I heard that you went into the OR
without even having breakfast.

359
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,831
Come back after you've eaten.

360
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,267
That's the only way you'll be able
to get through the night.

361
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,236
Thank you.

362
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,051
Did you call for me?

363
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,621
What's the difference between
a chest PA and a chest AP?

364
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:17,324
The way you position the patient
for the scan is different.

365
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,993
A patient stands up for a PA,
and they lie down for an AP.

366
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,330
And how were you supposed to
scan the ulcer perforation patient?

367
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:24,798
With him standing.

368
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,767
Is it a PA or an AP, then?

369
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:28,602
PA.

370
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,939
Is this a PA or an AP?

371
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:43,150
You took an AP, and then told us
that you couldn't see any free air?

372
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,785
Oh... I'm sorry.

373
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,554
I think something got mixed up
when I gave them the order.

374
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,223
I told you to do things right...

375
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,996
Instead of saying that you're sorry,
didn't I?

376
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,698
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:59,566
I'll do things right from now on.

378
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,101
Forget it. You can go now.

379
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,686
Aren't you being too harsh?

380
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,754
What?

381
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,989
She may have made a mistake,

382
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,124
but you don't need to be so mean to her.

383
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,093
It's not like
she misdiagnosed the patient.

384
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,161
She realized it was an ulcer perforation
and notified you,

385
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:30,964
so that the patient received surgery
before he got sepsis!

386
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,199
Nurse Eun-tak.

387
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,168
It wasn't just once or twice.

388
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,103
He's been going at her for a while now.

389
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,041
He keeps looking down on her character
instead of just critiquing her.

390
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:45,145
And I can't bear to just stand by
and watch him do this anymore.

391
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,380
Nurse Eun-tak.

392
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,048
Listen, Nurse Park Eun-tak.

393
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,751
Mind your own business.

394
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,220
This is an issue between us doctors.

395
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,589
It's not something for a mere nurse
to be getting involved in.

396
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,391
This doesn't concern people
on your level!

397
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,162
I'm sorry, Dr Do In-bum.

398
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:03,897
I'll be sure to talk to him.

399
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:07,901
So stop this already,
since there are patients here.

400
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,011
You were the one who was in the wrong.

401
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,079
But Nurse Oh!

402
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:21,615
You may not like the way he works,

403
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:24,251
but you shouldn't complain like that.

404
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:26,153
You understand what I'm saying,
don't you?

405
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,216
You're here?

406
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,185
Mr Director.

407
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,854
How have you been?

408
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,631
Section Chief Jang.

409
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,933
Take that man out of here right now.

410
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,867
Pardon?

411
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,537
It seems that I make you uncomfortable.

412
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,573
Yeah, you do.

413
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,574
Why?

414
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:25,045
Does seeing me bring back
the bad memories you'd buried?

415
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:28,182
Do you two know each other,
by any chance?

416
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:30,384
We do if he says we do,

417
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,887
but we don't if he says we don't.

418
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:44,031
I don't know what kind of offer from
Director Do has you skulking around...

419
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:47,467
...but I don't want to say even
a single word to a reporter like you.

420
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:48,936
So, get the heck out, right now.

421
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:52,973
This is the problem with you,
Dr Bu Yong-joo.

422
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,275
You treat reporters like trash,

423
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:57,211
and think we'd write anything
for the right price.

424
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:59,479
You really know how to piss me off.

425
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:01,582
You are trash, though.

426
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,985
I'm better than you, at least,
who told a younger colleague...

427
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:09,189
...to perform surgery in your stead and
ended up killing someone.

428
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,292
I don't kill people, at the very least.

429
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:16,196
Don't you know how many people
have suffered and eventually died...

430
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:19,900
...due to the stress
they felt from you writing...

431
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:22,302
...whatever you pleased?

432
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,037
Stop avoiding me, then,

433
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:28,342
and show me evidence to
back up your "truth."

434
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,110
If you keep avoiding me
because you think I'm trash,

435
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:33,113
the misunderstandings against you
will only continue to grow.

436
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,048
Why should I have to offer...

437
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:38,151
...any evidence to a jerk like you
and offer excuses to you?

438
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:42,623
Because people want the truth.

439
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:45,859
The truth?

440
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:57,271
And if you do find out the truth...

441
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:02,142
...do you have the courage to
make that truth known to the world?

442
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:09,149
This is Dr Ahn Woo-yeol,

443
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,419
a cardiothoracic surgeon
from the main hospital.

444
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,789
It seems that he quite enjoyed
watching the surgery today.

445
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,958
He praised your work quite a bit.

446
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:21,495
It was mostly Teacher Kim
who did well, not me.

447
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,431
Dr Bu Yong-joo may be skilled,

448
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:28,001
but no doctor can do much without
a competent main assistant.

449
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:31,104
I'm sure you saw me screw up, though.

450
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:36,143
Thanks to my screw-up,
we were set back 10 minutes.

451
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,079
You really are quite humble.

452
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:42,482
She's someone who I'd been
taking care of.

453
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:44,585
She may be my friend's daughter,

454
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:47,454
but I considered her
my own as I raised her.

455
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:53,093
From now on, you're a stranger to me.

456
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,798
Did you not contact me
all this time due to the...

457
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,335
...small argument we had before?

458
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,671
No. It's not like that.

459
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:11,178
I only said that as a fatherly figure,
so you shouldn't be like this as an adult.

460
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,547
I've done so much for you, after all.

461
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,216
Most young people are like this nowadays.

462
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:17,618
Back in our day,

463
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:22,823
we did everything to try
and placate our superiors.

464
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,494
But young people nowadays just
cut off contact with you altogether.

465
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,197
I'm sorry.

466
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,966
I guess I was being narrow-minded.

467
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:38,205
Anyways, it was great meeting you,
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

468
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,841
I want to meet up to hear more
about the surgery in detail,

469
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:42,509
when you have time.

470
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,444
Oh, yes.

471
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,713
You're single too, aren't you, Dr Ahn?

472
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:51,752
Our Dr Yoon Seo-Jung is crazy
about work as well.

473
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,321
All she cares about is treating patients.

474
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,622
That's how she lives her life.

475
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:58,458
It'd be nice if you two
single folks could...

476
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:01,261
...start something beautiful together.

477
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:03,063
Isn't that right, Director?

478
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:06,033
I want you to find some time
and come to Seoul.

479
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,204
Let's have a meal together with Dr Ahn.

480
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,278
Excuse me.

481
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:19,880
What are you doing here, Dr Yoon?

482
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,548
Teacher Kim has been looking for you.

483
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:22,783
Teacher Kim has?

484
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,684
Hurry up.

485
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,085
I think it's something urgent.

486
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,155
Excuse me. I'll be going now.

487
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,134
Where's Teacher Kim?

488
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,603
In his office?

489
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,905
He's in the staff room.

490
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,641
In the staff room?

491
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:59,019
What's going on?

492
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:02,656
You haven't eaten yet, right?

493
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,659
I though you said that
Teacher Kim called me!

494
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,195
Our options are
black bean noodles and pizza.

495
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:10,531
Those are the only things
available for delivery now.

496
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:19,039
Don't stick around when you're stuck
in another situation like that.

497
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,474
Just leave.

498
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:23,477
Why were you sitting there,
listening to all that nonsense?

499
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:27,414
Do I need to write a sign
and stick it on your back?

500
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:30,617
"Yoon Seo-Jung has a man."

501
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:32,286
"Don't even think about her."

502
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,420
Like that?

503
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,890
Don't you dare sit through
something like that again, like an idiot.

504
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,260
If you do, I'll go to Director Do
myself and reveal everything.

505
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,997
I'll say, "Dr Yoon has a man."

506
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,066
"And I'm that man!"

507
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,634
Like that.

508
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,070
Geez, it's so cheesy.

509
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,072
What, you think I won't be able to do it?

510
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,779
Want me to go and
say it to him right now?

511
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:55,209
Pizza.

512
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,847
I want to eat pizza.

513
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,715
I'm so hungry right now.

514
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:06,753
I knew you would.

515
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,422
You're hungry, right?

516
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,325
Let's finish this conversation
after we've eaten.

517
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,642
What about a beverage?

518
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:30,444
Anything's fine.

519
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,947
Do you want Coke or Sprite?

520
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,083
Anything.

521
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:41,355
Don't you know that "anything" is
the most difficult answer to deal with?

522
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:05,979
Oh... oh geez.

523
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,614
I can't even place my order.

524
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:29,636
Nurse Eun-tak.

525
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,171
Yes?

526
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:35,275
About you taking my side before?

527
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:39,613
I'm thankful for the sentiment, but...

528
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,550
I'd like it if you didn't
do that from now on.

529
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:50,557
I'm still in the process of learning and
I make a lot of mistakes,

530
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:57,030
so being yelled at for my many mistakes
is very helpful for me.

531
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:59,533
There's a difference between
being yelled at...

532
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,001
...and being looked down upon.

533
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:06,306
Anyways, I think it's something
I have to handle on my own.

534
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:07,341
So...

535
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:12,145
Even so, I don't think it's right for you
to be mistreated like this.

536
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:17,751
That's how I learned
things here, at Doldam.

537
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:20,487
I was given respect
despite my young age...

538
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:23,724
...and I may have received scolding
for big mistakes,

539
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,326
but I never had my character
looked down upon like that.

540
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:30,330
He continues to do it
because you accept this behavior.

541
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,912
He thinks it's okay to treat you this way
because of that.

542
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:37,371
I didn't speak to Dr Do that way
just to take your side.

543
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:42,309
If I saw anyone else here being treated
like that at Doldam Hospital,

544
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:45,312
I would've reacted the same way.

545
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,502
Yes, this is the ER.

546
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:10,103
Nurse Oh!

547
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,605
Come to Director Yeo's office
for a moment.

548
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,240
It's an emergency!

549
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,944
Reporter Oh Sung-jae?

550
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,078
What about him?

551
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,548
He's currently threatening to
reveal Teacher Kim's past.

552
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:24,318
He started by having him kicked out of
Geosan for the surgery incident,

553
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:27,321
and even mentioned a woman named
Jang Hyun-joo or something.

554
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:33,227
So why did you take a reporter like that
to Teacher Kim's office?

555
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:34,828
I never knew he'd do that!

556
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:38,365
I thought he'd just be writing about
the successful transplant surgery,

557
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:40,367
and make Doldam Hospital
more famous and such!

558
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,502
He said he would, but then...

559
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,303
...Chairman Shin hasn't even woken up yet,

560
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,205
so why are you getting ahead of yourself?

561
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:46,206
Huh?

562
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:49,109
That was a bit harsh.

563
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,223
What do you mean,
I was getting ahead of myself?

564
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:56,483
Director Yeo!

565
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,118
Where are you going?
We're not finished talking yet.

566
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,821
I forgot that there was something
I needed to attend to in Sokcho.

567
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,192
I'm sorry.

568
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,493
Excuse me.

569
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,095
Why are you suddenly bringing up Sokcho?

570
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:09,329
You!

571
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:11,632
You really behave too lightly...

572
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:16,637
Oh, goodness!

573
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,805
You think I'm doing this for myself?

574
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,779
I did all of this
for the sake of the hospital!

575
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,309
Why, I never!

576
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:39,960
It seems that the Jang Hyun-joo incident
keeps catching up to him.

577
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,398
It's not like Teacher Kim told them
to cover him for the surgery.

578
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:46,700
So why isn't he saying
anything in his own defense?

579
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:49,570
That's just the type of guy
Bu Yong-joo is.

580
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:52,840
He's so rigid and doesn't have
a shred of flexibility in him.

581
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,677
I also think he must feel that,

582
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,347
he's partly responsible
for Ms Jang's death.

583
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:03,217
But still, this shouldn't remain
a secret forever.

584
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,519
He should let the world know,

585
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,187
what Do Yoon-wan and Geosan Hospital did,

586
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,822
what they did to her and
many other patients,

587
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,959
and how they blamed
Teacher Kim for all of that.

588
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:15,195
Isn't it about time to reveal
what needs to be revealed to the world?

589
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,797
That won't be easy.

590
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:17,865
And there's no way that the folks...

591
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,501
...at the main hospital would've
left behind any evidence.

592
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:27,174
But still, I really can't understand
why he hasn't done anything about this.

593
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:29,009
I mean...

594
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:32,012
...one of his precious disciples
died because of them.

595
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,850
Maybe he made the only decision he could,

596
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:40,354
not for the sake of the child who died,

597
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,357
but for a child who must live on.

598
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,193
A child?

599
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,428
Who?

600
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,165
That's all I can say.

601
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:56,436
I promised Teacher Kim that
I'd take this to my grave.

602
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,831
We'll be going to take
a CT scan of you soon,

603
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:26,500
so please hang on, sir.

604
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:29,636
Are you busy?

605
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:33,006
Oh, this is a patient
with right flank pain.

606
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,141
He has hematuria,

607
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:36,186
so we're waiting until we can get him
an abdominal CT scan.

608
00:44:36,276 --> 00:44:38,078
This appears to be a ureter stone.

609
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,981
Yes, I think so, too.

610
00:44:41,748 --> 00:44:45,519
I heard you took care of the
ulcer perforation patient this morning.

611
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:47,788
I'm sorry.

612
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:50,290
I heard that it could turn into sepsis,
so...

613
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,993
I made that decision
without your consent.

614
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,261
Good job.

615
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:55,796
Yes, I know.

616
00:44:57,097 --> 00:44:58,498
Wait, what?

617
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:01,635
Never mind if you didn't hear me.

618
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,872
-Keep up the good job.
-Yes.

619
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:34,601
You said you found this in
Teacher Kim's office?

620
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:39,573
I think this is what Bu Yong-joo
may have wanted to do at Doldam.

621
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:41,875
Bu Yong-joo.

622
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,811
So he was having wild dreams
over there, wasn't he?

623
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:47,447
To think that he was sketching out
such a ridiculous plan.

624
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:49,983
Well, it's not completely impossible.

625
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,387
Anyways, if the surgery is successful,

626
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:58,725
I'm sure that Chairman Shin will give
Bu Yong-joo all the power he can.

627
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:01,428
That won't happen.

628
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,398
Unfortunately for Bu Yong-joo...

629
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:09,870
the heavens still seem to be on my side,
thankfully enough.

630
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,743
He hasn't woken up yet.

631
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:21,515
His BP, CVP, ABG,
and VBG are all stable, though.

632
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,586
How long has it been
since the surgery has ended?

633
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:27,387
Nine hours, Doctor.

634
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:31,458
Let's keep monitoring his condition
until it hits the 12-hour mark.

635
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:37,531
He is a bit older, so there's a chance
that he may take longer to wake up.

636
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:38,999
Yes, Doctor.

637
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:51,378
What do you mean?

638
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,914
The chairman hasn't woken up yet?

639
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,216
Do you know what time it is?

640
00:46:58,285 --> 00:46:59,786
DIRECTOR SHIN HYUN-JUNG

641
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:01,989
Yes, Director?

642
00:47:02,055 --> 00:47:05,025
I received word early this morning that
the chairman hasn't woken up yet

643
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,160
and am on my way to Doldam right now.

644
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:11,465
I think I'll need to go there and
properly assess the situation.

645
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,268
Yes. Goodbye.

646
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,115
Hey, Dr Nam.

647
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,683
How were the propofol
and fentanyl levels?

648
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,753
I stopped administering it
around the 12-hour mark.

649
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,987
Just in case.

650
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:37,925
All of his vitals were
stable throughout the night.

651
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:40,527
There was barely any bleeding,
so we've started him on heparin.

652
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:43,330
There were no abrupt
changes in his vitals,

653
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,365
so why isn't he waking up?

654
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:52,239
-Doctor.
-Yeah?

655
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,741
The chairman's guardian
is outside right now.

656
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,243
I'll go.

657
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,144
No, no...

658
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,712
You stay here.

659
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,615
Let's go.

660
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,351
Oh yeah.

661
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:07,287
Call Mr Go, please.

662
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:16,363
What's going on?

663
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,732
Why isn't Father awake yet?

664
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,869
You said he'd be awake in
six to 12 hours at most!

665
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:23,937
It's 10 AM right now.

666
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:26,340
It's been 19 hours
since the surgery ended!

667
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:30,410
This isn't common, but it's possible.

668
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,179
We have to wait
another two or three days,

669
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,614
at the very least.

670
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,359
Why are you saying that now,
all of a sudden?

671
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,052
You said 12 hours before,
so why is it two to three days now?

672
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:42,890
In most cases, patients can
wake up within 12 hours.

673
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,625
But when the patient doesn't,

674
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:48,862
they need to be monitored
for 48 to 72 hours.

675
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:49,963
That's what I mean.

676
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,065
So all you're going to do is monitor him?

677
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:54,168
Even doing absolutely everything
you could wouldn't be enough,

678
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,903
yet all you're going to do is
sit and watch?

679
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:59,840
I did everything I could
in the operating room.

680
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:02,509
There was nothing that went wrong
with the surgery itself,

681
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:04,111
and we made sure to put him...

682
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:05,746
...under for the shortest
amount of time we could.

683
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:12,619
So all we can do now is wait
for the patient to wake up.

684
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:14,655
What do you mean,
there's nothing else you can do?

685
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:25,599
The fact that the chairman
hasn't awoken yet...

686
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,569
...means that there may be
a problem with his brain.

687
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,581
If that's the case,
you should hurry and take a CT scan.

688
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:32,706
I'm the doctor in charge of him.

689
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,241
And the one who decides,

690
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,043
whether or not he gets
a CT scan is me, too.

691
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:37,678
Look at you...

692
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:39,079
What do you mean?

693
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,615
Are you trying to stall for more time?

694
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,753
Can't you see what the heck is
connected to the chairman right now?

695
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:49,857
Four infusion pumps,

696
00:49:49,923 --> 00:49:53,627
two artificial heart valves,
and four thoracic tubes!

697
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:56,029
In total, he has 10 tubes
currently connected to him.

698
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,865
What if something goes wrong,

699
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:00,234
while he gets a CT scan with
all that on him?

700
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,935
Will you take responsibility then?

701
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,304
This is the problem with you.

702
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:09,576
You only believe in your skills
and refuse to admit your faults.

703
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:11,144
You only thought about...

704
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,447
...performing the perfect surgery
this time too, right?

705
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:15,148
Your real goal here was...

706
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:18,519
...finishing this transplant surgery
in six hours, right?

707
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,920
But!

708
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:22,990
I'm sure you never considered,

709
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,125
the fact that the chairman
wouldn't wake up.

710
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:27,861
So you're in shock,

711
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,097
and can't face reality.

712
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,365
Right?

713
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:35,736
Stop going on and on, and
cut to the chase, already.

714
00:50:35,802 --> 00:50:37,271
What's your point, then?

715
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:39,339
To be honest, I was curious.

716
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:42,209
I wanted to know why you insisted
that the chairman have this surgery,

717
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:46,146
with all of its risk factors
when he has terminal lung cancer.

718
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:51,051
But you only did all that
just for something like this?

719
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:54,721
Just because of something
like this, darn it?

720
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,430
A has-been doctor like you assembled...

721
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:07,034
...a team of incompetent people,
including an anesthesiologist,

722
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,836
who's being sued for malpractice,

723
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:11,104
a fellow who was kicked out of Geosan,

724
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:14,174
an ER specialist who has PTSD,

725
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,343
and a hospital staff who are out here
in the boonies,

726
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,789
and have never even seen
a large city university hospital before.

727
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:21,915
Just what kind of dream did you have
with such an incompetent crew?

728
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:24,051
A trauma center?

729
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,055
Is that what you wanted in exchange
for operating on the chairman?

730
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,590
A trauma center?

731
00:51:29,656 --> 00:51:31,758
Is that why you put the chairman,

732
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:35,028
who has terminal lung cancer
on your surgical bed, Bu Yong-joo?

733
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,176
THE SCAM BEHIND
THE RARE SURGERY PERFORMED AT

734
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:50,744
A COUNTRYSIDE HOSPITAL.

735
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,484
Bu Yong-joo, who was once called
"The God's Hand"...

736
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,911
...performed a heart transplant surgery
that was too much...

737
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,024
...for a chairman of
a hospital foundation to handle,

738
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:05,792
and has left him comatose.

739
00:52:09,663 --> 00:52:13,834
From this point onward,
you've lost your rights as his doctor.

740
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,236
Hey, Dr Shin.

741
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,504
Yes, Director?

742
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:20,307
You'll be taking care of
the chairman starting today.

743
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:23,076
Get a CT scan of him taken immediately.

744
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,145
Yes, sir.

745
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:29,116
If the CT results reveal that
he has any sort of brain damage,

746
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:31,285
you'll definitely be sued for malpractice,

747
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:34,121
and you'll have to be prepared to
lose your license, too.

748
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,723
What are you doing, Dr Shin?

749
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,225
Yes, sir.

750
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:43,797
Could you step aside, please?

751
00:52:47,034 --> 00:52:48,302
Please step aside.

752
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:50,237
Did you even wash your hands?

753
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:03,317
You're saying that you'll go in here now,
in your current state?

754
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:05,319
Into an ICU, of all places?

755
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,691
Mr Go!

756
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:11,758
Yes?

757
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,331
From this moment on, block off the ICU.

758
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:20,968
Nobody is allowed in without my consent.

759
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:22,936
Especially...

760
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,173
starting with him, and him.

761
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,011
Block it off so that not
even a single ant gets in there.

762
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:32,513
Yes, sir.

763
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,481
What the heck are you trying to do, here?

764
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:37,618
I'm protecting my patient,
as the doctor in charge of him.

765
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:38,519
Why?

766
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:43,123
Are you really planning to
kill the chairman?

767
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:56,603
You see this?

768
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:02,042
Chairman Shin wrote this for me
right before we went into surgery.

769
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:05,078
The one who has power over...

770
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:08,815
...what happens to him
after the surgery is solely me.

771
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,353
Only me.

772
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,089
That's what this means.

773
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:24,498
I'm the director of the main hospital
that commands yours.

774
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,633
How dare a mere surgeon at
one of our branch hospitals,

775
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,769
take full control over
what happens to our chairman!

776
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:30,504
How dare you!

777
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:33,507
I'm sure he has
a notarized copy of this, too.

778
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:40,214
What that means is that this document
is legally binding, probably.

779
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,748
Isn't that right, Manager Joo?

780
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,784
I got it notarized by...

781
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:45,853
...one of the attorneys
from the foundation.

782
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:47,421
And I was there when it happened.

783
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:48,856
You were?

784
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:54,628
And the fact that this document is
legally binding means it has legal power.

785
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:57,297
So stop getting in the way of us
treating our patients,

786
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:58,732
and piss off.

787
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:06,773
Do you not understand
what the heck I'm saying?

788
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:08,609
I said piss off.

789
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:32,165
I'll contact you as soon as
the chairman wakes up.

790
00:55:43,377 --> 00:55:48,315
You should've stopped Father
from writing such a thing.

791
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:49,883
And yet, you took his side?

792
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,619
Mr Chairman trusts him
more than anyone else.

793
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,221
And I feel the same way.

794
00:55:57,324 --> 00:55:59,259
You'd better be prepared for...

795
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:01,595
...what will happen if something
happens to Father.

796
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:33,861
DOLDAM HOSPITAL Plans for Establishing

797
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:36,864
Emergency Trauma Center

798
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:49,843
An age in which facts run wild.

799
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:06,260
A world in which the words of
the powerful become facts...

800
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:10,430
...and the words of the have-nots
are considered groundless rumors.

801
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:20,040
Welcome.

802
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,676
Hello.

803
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,589
Why did you come back here?

A world full of people who insist that
their truth is the absolute truth,

807
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,437

the truth seem like a lie.
