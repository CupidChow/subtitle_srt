00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,550
APPENDIX

2
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,390
-Thank you.
-Take care.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,430
Kang Dong-joo

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,970
Trial result for Dr Nam Do-il?

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,850
-Great job.
-You too, doctor.

6
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,860
I guess you guys are done with
the operation.

7
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,880
We have letters for you two.

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,125
One for Dr Nam,

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,909
and one for Dr Kang.

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,273
So, who would like to read it first?

11
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,652
Are you guys just going to leave?

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,110
Dr Nam.

13
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,505
Dr Kang.

14
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,030
Hey, Dong-joo. What are you up to?

15
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,365
Dr Yoon, can you please knock?

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,710
What is that?

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,670
Did you get a letter?

18
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,336
It’s nothing.

19
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,618
I need to go to ICU.

20
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,910
What’s up with him?

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,218
It seems like an international postmark.

22
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,730
From USA.

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,970
From America.

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,289
America?

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,097
A letter came from America?

26
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,970
But why is he hiding it from me?

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,400
Did you see which part of
the United States it was from?

28
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,129
I couldn’t see because I signed
for another letter.

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,623
There was letter from
The Supreme Court for Dr Nam Do-il.

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,841
Really?

31
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,944
Did Dr Nam finally receive
the trial verdict?

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,646
About seven years ago, a ten-year-old
child died during surgery.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,831
It was an elbow supracondyle fracture,

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,590
but she later died from fat embolism.

35
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,530
The parents blamed it on
the anesthesiology department,

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,860
so they sued them.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,070
He lost in the first trial, but it got
overturned in the second trial.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
So, the case ended up
at the Supreme Court.

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,390
Right after the incident,
he left Geosan University Hospital

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,834
and worked as a freelancer.

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,911
Then, he came to Doldam through
his relations with Director Yeo.

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,149
After that, Dr Nam brought in
Teacher Kim,

43
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,944
and Teacher Kim brought me in.

44
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,660
And then, Nurse Oh called me
to follow her.

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,129
It’s not like I called you,
you just followed me here.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,835
I see.

47
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,295
In the end, you and Teacher Kim
came to Doldam Hospital through Dr Nam.

48
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,124
Is that right?

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,980
And then, I met Dr Yoon.

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,051
Wait, You didn’t know?

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,710
Know what?

52
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,290
Teacher Kim’s first surgery in
Doldam was performed on you.

53
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,313
What?

54
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,110
It was me?

55
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:57,955
There is a patient here!

56
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,820
Doctor. This way.

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,820
Here?

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,830
-What should we do?
-What?

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,860
The on-call doctor is not
available today.

60
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,773
I can perform the surgery.

61
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,196
Have you ever been inside
an operating room before?

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,700
I’m sorry, I don’t have any
experience in the surgery room.

63
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,140
Okay then, have hydration done
with normal saline

64
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,970
and call Dr Nam Do-il,
as soon as possible.

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,031
Yes, Doctor.

66
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,141
Um, this is Dr Kim.

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,810
I have an emergency patient who
needs surgery as soon as possible.

68
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,030
I really need you, Myung-shim...

69
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,794
Can you come in, please?

70
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,252
Okay.

71
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,339
Please come quickly.

72
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,430
That was the beginning of Doldam Hospital
for me and Teacher Kim.

73
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,110
Everything has a point of beginning.

74
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,914
And behind all beginnings,

75
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,820
there are causes and motivations.

76
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,820
Whether it begins from me
or someone else,

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,937
the beginning shows
the direction of a life,

78
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,873
and the direction of journey it will take.

79
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,850
The beginning of everything.

80
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,839
Would there be any other stronger
coincidence and destiny

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,194
than the beginning?

82
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,364
Hi.

83
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,808
It’s been a while.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,644
How did you...

85
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,331
How...

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,270
This place is nicer than I thought.

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,330
I thought it was an old hospital
on verge of collapsing.

88
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,219
I have been hearing about you
since the end of last year.

89
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
I also heard that

90
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,771
you performed the artificial heart
transplant surgery for the Chairman.

91
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,742
I also found out that you are staying
at Doldam Hospital.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,931
How have you been?

93
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,317
You still have this with you?

94
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,332
Yeah...I still listen to it.

95
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,009
Music is so amazing.

96
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,810
It suddenly feels we've gone back
to those times.

97
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Right?

98
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,480
It does.

99
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,720
When did you come back?

100
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,489
About three... four years ago?

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,403
I look older now, don’t I?

102
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,130
You’re still the same.

103
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,732
You look great.

104
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,433
I know you’re lying, but I still
like to hear that.

105
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,541
People like compliment as
they grow older.

106
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,180
What is this?

107
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,908
You make your own coffee?

108
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,950
Yes.

109
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,760
As a hobby.

110
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,680
As...

111
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,085
As a hobby?

112
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,875
You really hated that kind of stuff.

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,173
I did?

114
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,880
You hated watching movies and
looking for famous restaurants.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,556
You especially hated sitting in a café
while talking over tea.

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,340
Now you are brewing coffee yourself?

117
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,040
I did that?

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,340
Whenever we went on dates, I always
tried not to burden you.

119
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,067
I can even write a dissertation
on that subject.

120
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,360
I really did that?

121
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,320
I’ve never seen you smile like that.

122
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,100
By the way, what brings you here?

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,305
I don’t think you came all the way
down here just to see me...

124
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,902
I know a Korean-Chinese woman
from a volunteering group I help out at.

125
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,080
Okay.

126
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,131
She is diagnosed with pheochromocytoma

127
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,614
and malignant hypertension.

128
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,660
I came here to ask if you
can perform her surgery.

129
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,310
That’s not a complicated surgery...

130
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,227
Why didn’t you ask
the hospital that diagnosed her?

131
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,772
Because...

132
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,423
She is a HIV positive patient.

133
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,414
Are you really not going to eat?

134
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,745
No. I am not going to eat.

135
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,852
Three minutes passed.

136
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,776
What’s wrong with him?

137
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,303
Did something happen?

138
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,440
He’s been like that all day.

139
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,513
He was reading a letter during the day.

140
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,459
Maybe he got some bad news?

141
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,061
A letter?

142
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,420
It looked like an international mail.

143
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,830
From USA.

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,460
From America.

145
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,610
Everyone!

146
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,352
Breaking news.

147
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,707
Is there an emergency patient?

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,550
There is a woman.

149
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,580
A female patient?

150
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,134
No, I mean Teacher Kim
has a female visitor.

151
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,827
She’s even very beautiful.

152
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,380
What?

153
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,628
A beautiful woman?

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,790
Yes.

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,230
I can’t even explain in words
how pretty she is.

156
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,090
She is currently in
Teacher Kim’s office right now.

157
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,376
What is this?
They left in the middle of eating.

158
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,470
Is it a big deal that Teacher Kim is
meeting a woman?

159
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,756
Is it?

160
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,333
I can’t really see her face.

161
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,101
It seems like they are not in
a good mood.

162
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,410
I got a call from Teacher Kim.

163
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,680
From Teacher Kim?

164
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,965
I didn’t get one.

165
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,365
He’s telling us to come
to the Director’s office.

166
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,512
The Director’s office?

167
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,490
I’ll be back soon.

168
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,800
-Doctor.
-What?

169
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,222
Look over there.

170
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,530
Hello.

171
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,722
HIV positive?

172
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,739
HIV, do you mean AIDS?

173
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,242
The patient’s current blood pressure is
very high.

174
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:18,023
It will be very dangerous if we do not
perform the surgery, as soon as possible.

175
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,426
The patient requested to have
the surgery at several hospitals,

176
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,922
but was rejected with various reasons, and
now she came to our hospital.

177
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,939
I think we should reject the patient too.

178
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,020
An AIDS patient?

179
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,012
What if the news spreads that an AIDS
patient had a surgery at our hospital?

180
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,629
No one will be coming to our
hospital anymore.

181
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,279
An AIDS patient is also a patient too,
Section Chief Jang.

182
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,513
This is not acceptable, Teacher Kim.

183
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,350
Director.

184
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,141
I agree with Manager Jang, Teacher Kim.

185
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,300
The procedure will not be
an open surgery,

186
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,440
but will proceed with
the laparoscope method.

187
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,868
If we have shield masks on and
take extra precautions,

188
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,271
there won't be any problems, Director.

189
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,759
An accident can happen anytime,
no matter how careful we are.

190
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,069
What if we unfortunately get poked with
needles when drawing the patient’s blood?

191
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,196
How can you treat any patient
when you get scared of

192
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,427
a situation that has not
even happened yet?

193
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,535
Then I will explain what kind of
situation would happen for sure.

194
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,674
When we perform surgery on
the HIV patient,

195
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,300
one of two operating rooms cannot be
used at least for two days,

196
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,436
as we need to disinfect the whole room.

197
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,000
Then, what are you going to do with
all the incoming trauma patients?

198
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,135
Hey, Do In-bum.

199
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,136
If you put it that way,

200
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,194
the patient cannot receive surgery
anywhere in Korea.

201
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,015
Regardless of anything,

202
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,956
I am worried about your wrist.

203
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,590
Laparoscope method means that
you will need to

204
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,974
move the muscles of your wrist and
fingers more than ever...

205
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,615
My wrist is my own problem to solve...

206
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,086
Director.

207
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,403
We need your approval
to perform this surgery.

208
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,976
Please approve it.

209
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,319
You cannot approve it.

210
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,446
For all the patients who visit our
hospital, I oppose this wholeheartedly.

211
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,057
Director.

212
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,813
It’s taking longer than
I thought it would.

213
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,210
What kind of meeting could it be
and why is it taking so long?

214
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,140
How did it go?

215
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,750
Bring the patient early in
the morning tomorrow.

216
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,842
Bring all the radiology information
you have

217
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,791
and let’s try to set the surgery date
as soon as possible.

218
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,502
This is all because of that woman.

219
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,486
Teacher Kim made a poor decision
because of her.

220
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:28,944
Section Chief Jang.

221
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,807
I mean... This doesn’t make any sense.

222
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,650
Teacher Kim’s wrist is not in
a good condition.

223
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,690
And now...

224
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,652
He wants to perform surgery on
an AIDS patient?

225
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,822
Section Chief Jang.

226
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,770
Can you go persuade Teacher Kim
one last time?

227
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,417
I don’t think Teacher Kim made
a wrong decision.

228
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,312
Nurse Oh!

229
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,919
Even the Director approved.
That’s enough.

230
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,927
Hey, shouldn’t we stop Teacher Kim?

231
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,474
Even if we do, do you think
Teacher Kim is going to listen?

232
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,221
As you said,

233
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,758
it’s not like Teacher Kim’s wrist is
in good condition...

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,812
If you’re that worried,
you can perform the surgery.

235
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,262
You are better than me on
the laparoscope.

236
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,473
Are you crazy? Why would I go in there...

237
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,239
I am not going into that operation room.

238
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
What are you doing?

239
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,070
Dr Yoon.

240
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,680
Huh?

241
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,750
Oh, sorry... I’m a bit tired.

242
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,322
So... What was the meeting about?

243
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,363
It’s a HIV positive patient
with pheochromocytoma.

244
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,521
Teacher Kim wants to schedule
the surgery tomorrow.

245
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,575
Oh, I see.

246
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,904
What’s wrong?

247
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,063
Are you not feeling well?

248
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,263
I guess...

249
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,589
I am not feeling well today.

250
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,310
I should go home early and get some rest.

251
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,111
See you guys later.

252
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,810
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

253
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,780
Nurse Oh.

254
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,271
Is the rumor true?

255
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,009
Is an AIDS patient getting
surgery at our hospital?

256
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,091
Because of that, it's been so tense here
since morning.

257
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,915
What?

258
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,944
A HIV positive patient is having
surgery here?

259
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,151
Yes, sir.

260
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,105
I don't know how I feel about other
things, but I think that is just too far.

261
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,380
I can’t believe this...

262
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,553
That is just nonsense...

263
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,720
Nurse Oh.

264
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,229
I think they are here.

265
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,290
The HIV positive patient.

266
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,661
What do we do, Nurse Oh?

267
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,772
What do you think?

268
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,104
She is beautiful just as I said...

269
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,454
-Right?
-Shush...

270
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,520
This way.

271
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,860
It’s alright.

272
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,627
Huh?

273
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,632
Huh?

274
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,458
Isn’t that Lee Yong-Joo?

275
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,847
What is it?

276
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,396
Do you know her?

277
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,980
Of course, she was in my class.

278
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,636
Is she also a doctor?

279
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,064
She was also a general surgeon like me.

280
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,085
She was a hardcore worker back then...

281
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,370
I thought she was volunteering
around the world

282
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,717
with Doctors Without the Borders...

283
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,070
When did she come back?

284
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,012
Really?

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,918
Doctors Without the Borders?

286
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,276
She was famous because she was
campus couple with Teacher Kim.

287
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,886
What?

288
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,004
Teacher Kim and that lady were
dating in college?

289
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,146
Yes, Teacher Kim.

290
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,072
Yes, I’ll be right in.

291
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,574
BP is at 220/120...

292
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,763
It seems really high, doesn’t it?

293
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,620
Any medications?

294
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,017
Beta-blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker.

295
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,374
She’s on two strong pressure
depressors and her BP is like this?

296
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,931
How many hospitals have you visited?

297
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,955
We visited five in person...

298
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,266
And called countless more.

299
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,589
Can she speak Korean?

300
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,890
Yeah, she's good.

301
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,255
Miss, you have a very high blood pressure.

302
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,450
If your BP is still this high after taking
strong pressure depressors,

303
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,944
then this is very dangerous..

304
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,880
We would have to perform the surgery
as soon as possible.

305
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,932
Is that okay?

306
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,122
Nurse Oh.

307
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,260
Yes.

308
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,211
Please prepare the OR and
give others the operation report.

309
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,857
Also, have this radiology up on the EMR.

310
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,060
Yes, sir.

311
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,053
Would you like to come with me?

312
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,988
It’s alright, I will stay here
until the surgery is done.

313
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,101
Yes.

314
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,770
It’s worse than I thought.

315
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,047
If there is hemorrhage in the brain,
we can’t do much.

316
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,243
I know.

317
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,186
But still, thank you.

318
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,360
For rushing the surgery.

319
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,876
How do I respond when someone

320
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,312
thanks me for doing something
that is already expected?

321
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,547
Nonsense.

322
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,195
You remember.

323
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,580
The surgery is scheduled
for this afternoon.

324
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,620
Instead of assigning an assistant for
this, I'll take volunteers.

325
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,850
Who wants to volunteer between you two?

326
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,021
I will go in.

327
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,092
But...

328
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,417
Will your wrist really be okay?

329
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,234
I can take the laparoscope, if you want.

330
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,529
It’s better not to move it too much,

331
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,110
but I don’t have time to think about that.

332
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,794
Don’t forget to wear double gloves,

333
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,590
and prepare anything that will come in
contact with the patient as disposables.

334
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,898
Yes, I will do that.

335
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,020
Okay.

336
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,300
Let me know when everything’s ready.

337
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,390
Yes.

338
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,146
If you’re unlucky,

339
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,363
you can get infected...

340
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,223
Aren’t you scared?

341
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,323
Not really.

342
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,765
I don’t think my life is that unlucky.

343
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,164
Did you get a good rest last night?

344
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,169
Yes, of course.

345
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,628
By any chance,

346
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,777
are you mad at me?

347
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,930
Me?

348
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,230
Why would I?

349
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,196
Did you do something wrong?

350
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,179
No, just...

351
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,170
I just have a feeling that you are.

352
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,326
Not at all.

353
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,371
Hey, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

354
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,712
There is a general surgery at number 5,
but it’s killing me.

355
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,399
He’s been idling for about ten minutes.

356
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,680
Really?

357
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,050
I will take a look.

358
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,138
Yeah.

359
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,741
Ri-Dan, it’s mom...

360
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,064
Of course, I am fine, and healthy...

361
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,133
Mommy misses you so much too...

362
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,708
Did you really participate
in the drawing contest?

363
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,865
Wow, great job, my girl.

364
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,422
Of course, I am working diligently
to get you

365
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,149
a piano and the books that you want.

366
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,945
Listen to your grandma until
I see you again.

367
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,630
Okay?

368
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,430
Doctor.

369
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,870
Who is she on the phone with?

370
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,726
I think she was talking to her daughter.

371
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,580
The daughter doesn’t seem to know
that her mom is sick.

372
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,310
In this surgery, excising the cytoma is
the most dangerous moment,

373
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,910
so Do-il, you...

374
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,580
Don’t worry about it.

375
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,750
I’ll take good care of her,
no matter what.

376
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Okay.

377
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,540
If we pass that phase, we should be fine.

378
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,150
Doctor, the patient is in the OR.

379
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,190
Yeah?

380
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I will go in to get ready.

381
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,890
-Let’s go, Kang Dong-joo.
-Okay.

382
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,589
-Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

383
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,199
I ask this one last time, Teacher Kim.

384
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,146
Please stop the surgery.

385
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,101
I am sincerely advising you to
stop putting our hospital into peril

386
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,470
just because of your
personal relationship.

387
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,829
So, please...

388
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,811
Stop this surgery.

389
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,420
Frankly speaking, if it weren’t for
Lee Yong-Joo

390
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,012
who asked for this personal favor,

391
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,710
you wouldn’t have pushed
this surgery forcefully, right?

392
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,212
You probably wouldn’t have.

393
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,584
Yes, that's right.

394
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,212
I asked for a personal favor.

395
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,916
If I didn’t do that,
this person would end up dying.

396
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,131
So I asked my old boyfriend, who I broke
up with more than ten years ago,

397
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,982
for a difficult favor.

398
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,153
Is it that bad?

399
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,490
No, it’s not bad, but she is
HIV positive, so...

400
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,309
I know.

401
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,129
Performing surgery on a HIV positive
patient is very scary.

402
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,120
But, do you know what is
scarier than that?

403
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,084
It’s your prejudice.

404
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
I can’t say anything on how you
feel about what could possibly happen,

405
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,575
But abandoning your duties for something
that might not happen....

406
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,545
Isn't this a serious problem?

407
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,519
Don’t just oppose this situation.

408
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,320
Think about it with a sincere heart.

409
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,390
I beg you.

410
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,660
You didn’t have to go that far...

411
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,908
Then, I’ll be going in since
the patient is waiting.

412
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,943
I will say hello after the surgery.

413
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,857
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital ER.

414
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,975
Doctor Kim.

415
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,240
Yeah.

416
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,883
It’s a gunshot patient.

417
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,715
What?

418
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,880
Move him into the hybrid room.

419
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,230
He got shot by turning bullets
while he was trying to catch a wild boar.

420
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,300
Is it from a shotgun?

421
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes, that’s right.

422
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,545
-How are the vitals?
-BP is at 90/40 and heart rate is at 140.

423
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,388
Both IV lines with full drop 1L
of normal saline.

424
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,951
Please order the RVC tech in stat
as well as heptarose to patient.

425
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,010
Also, 50ml of O2.

426
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,910
Yes.

427
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,520
Sir, calm down, we will take a good
care of it, so please calm down.

428
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,605
Let me look at the wound.

429
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,323
What on earth, how many wounds are there?

430
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,767
Thigh to left abdomen,
the wounds are spread all over, Teacher.

431
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,950
It seems to be more than twenty.

432
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,097
Okay, Get the FAST.

433
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,800
There are some stagnant
fluids in the abdomen.

434
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,496
Some intestinal damages, too.

435
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,380
How are the vitals?

436
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,610
BP is at 100/70 and heart rate is at 120.

437
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,550
Take a CT quick and
send him to the OR straight away.

438
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,631
Yes, sir.

439
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,849
Everyone is wearing shield glasses
and disposable gowns, right?

440
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,350
Also, make sure to wear two gloves.

441
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,758
After this procedure, this OR will be
closed for 24 hours after disinfection.

442
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,426
Now, I will initiate the anesthesia.

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,914
Just think that you will be sleeping
comfortably for a bit.

444
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,770
Please give her Propofol 120mg
and Lotironium 40mg.

445
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,850
Yes.

446
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,191
The disposable laryngoscope is
better than I thought.

447
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,290
Even the light is bright.

448
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,451
Nowadays, the trend is to
change to disposables.

449
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,760
You know about
the infant infection incident

450
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,400
because of the laryngoscope, right?

451
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,318
They consider those medical supplies

452
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,479
as just observable objects and
are importing, so...

453
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,565
By the way, I heard that you received
a letter from the Supreme Court?

454
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,155
Did the results come out alright?

455
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,330
Yes.

456
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,061
But even if I win,
I don’t feel better about it...

457
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,899
Still, that’s a relief.

458
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,406
Dr Kang, I heard you also received
a letter from America.

459
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,940
Huh?

460
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,340
Didn’t Dr Yoon ask you about it?

461
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,661
She heard it with me.

462
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,656
Dr Nam, it’s Teacher Kim.

463
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,131
Do-il, did you start the anesthesia?

464
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,238
Yes, it’s done. We’re ready for you.

465
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,010
Why, what’s going on?

466
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,818
We just got a gunshot wound
patient just a moment ago.

467
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,187
He has about twenty wounds?

468
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,670
Hey, Dong-joo.

469
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,690
Yes, sir.

470
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,301
Come here right now.

471
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,699
Yes, sir.

472
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,640
Yes, Doctor.

473
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,152
Dong-joo, you take this patient.

474
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,410
As soon as the CT results come out,
check the location of the bullets and

475
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,155
move the patient to the OR.

476
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,737
Bullets have lead, so they can
damage the organs.

477
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,421
So, don't waste any time and
take those out as soon as possible.

478
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,675
But I don’t have any experience
with gunshot wound patients, Doctor.

479
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,420
You’re right.

480
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,760
You don’t have pheochromocytoma patient
experience, either.

481
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,018
No, I don’t.

482
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,839
What should we do?

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,790
I will go in with him.

484
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,800
I have a lot of experiences with
gunshot wound patients.

485
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,940
There were gunshot wound patients
every day in the area that I stayed at.

486
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,830
I will guide and assist you.

487
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,250
Is that okay?

488
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,962
Yes.

489
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,880
Okay, I will take care of the
pheochromocytoma patient first...

490
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,180
Take care please.

491
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,660
Thank you for your help.

492
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,806
Thank you.

493
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,695
Hey, Do In-bum.

494
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,039
Why are you here?

495
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,928
I will take the laparoscope, Doctor.

496
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,320
With your wrist in that condition,

497
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,759
I think It'll be better for me to do it.

498
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,930
Do you have experience with
a pheochromocytoma patient?

499
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,415
I have, once.

500
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,546
This time, I really do.

501
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,914
Can I do it, please?

502
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,734
According to the CT result,
there are total 14 spots.

503
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,040
Five in the abdomen, 3 in the pelvis,

504
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,162
and the rest in the thigh area.

505
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,943
CT and X-ray show only that much,
but there could possibly be more.

506
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,040
Keep that in mind.

507
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,277
Yes. Then let’s begin.

508
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,352
We will start with the abdomen.

509
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,560
Knife.

510
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,690
Gauze.

511
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,241
Bovie.

512
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,118
Retractor.

513
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,133
One more please.

514
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,120
Okay then, let’s get started.

515
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,787
Scalpel.

516
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,893
Trocar.

517
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,754
Scope.

518
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,685
Hold, please.

519
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,930
We'll insert three more trocars.

520
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,724
Scalpel.

521
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,290
Bovie.

522
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,335
Let’s see...

523
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,444
I found it.

524
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,671
Forcep, please.

525
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,770
Count, please.

526
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,288
Yes, sir.

527
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,589
We should excise this bowel, no?

528
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,669
This is...

529
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,128
It got stuck near the artery.

530
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,435
Prepare something I can it tie with.

531
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,342
Hemostat.

532
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,080
Dr Lee, you are assisting right now.

533
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,840
Sure, I will keep that in mind.

534
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,743
Hemostat.

535
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,350
Bovie.

536
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,122
Sponge stick.

537
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,330
GIM.

538
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,807
Specimen out.

539
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,674
Back up.

540
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,234
Scissor.

541
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,337
One more, please.

542
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,948
GI.

543
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,422
Did all five come out?

544
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,907
Four. We have one more left.

545
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,821
It seems to be near the kidney.

546
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,379
Teacher Kim’s first love?

547
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,950
Yes.

548
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,080
Do you know how how they met

549
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,738
and how they broke up?

550
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,178
I was wondering if you heard anything...

551
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,694
Hm...

552
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,598
I don’t really know...

553
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,528
I know a bit about their history.

554
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,681
Bu Yong-joo and Lee Young-Jo fought
every time their eyes met.

555
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,386
They wrangled up each other and
argued over everything.

556
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,852
They even threw down desks a few times.

557
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,138
We all thought that one of them
would die while fighting.

558
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,346
But...

559
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,236
One day, they started dating.

560
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,625
Wow...

561
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,553
What is this?

562
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,524
They're very similar to a couple
I know of right now.

563
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,424
Huh?

564
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,999
But...

565
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,010
How did they break up?

566
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,425
First, Teacher Kim left for Cleveland so
their relationship became weak.

567
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,148
And then, Lee Yong-joo left to do
Doctors without Borders, or something.

568
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,690
After that, their relationship turned out
the way it did.

569
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,418
I see...

570
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,360
People break up if they get separated.

571
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,000
I will exchange the adrenal vein.

572
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,020
Hemoclip.

573
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,452
Metzenbaum scissors.

574
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,177
Hook probe.

575
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,600
Careful now.

576
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,229
That’s the adrenal artery.

577
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,476
Hemoclip.

578
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,540
One more.

579
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,984
The blood pressure will drastically drop,
so don’t be too alarmed.

580
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,460
Is the BP okay?

581
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,960
It seems to have dropped too low.

582
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,890
BP is at 110/70.

583
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,590
It did drop a lot,

584
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,930
but it’s alright for now.

585
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,246
Leave it to me and continue.

586
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,320
Yes.

587
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,758
Hook probe.

588
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,760
Bovie.

589
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,515
Dr Kang, Teacher Kim is calling.

590
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,638
How is it going?

591
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,202
We are still in the process of finding
a bullet near the kidney.

592
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,609
There it is.

593
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,392
It barely missed the kidney.

594
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,126
There is a bit of an injury here,
but nothing major.

595
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,079
How many did you take out?

596
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,966
All five bullets are out
from the abdomen.

597
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,005
This patient is very lucky.

598
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,147
The bullets missed all the vital lines.

599
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,557
Keep up the good work.

600
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,794
We got it all out.

601
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,111
Give me that, please.

602
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,775
All done.

603
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,167
Specimen out.

604
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,969
Get me a scope.

605
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,576
There is no bleeding.

606
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,271
Okay.

607
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,790
Looks clean.

608
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,152
Good job.

609
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,061
Don’t lose focus and finish up.

610
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,225
Yes.

611
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,973
We will insert the drain and finish up.

612
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,773
How is it going here?

613
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,553
We found eight from the pelvis.

614
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,171
We will insert a drain and
move down to the side.

615
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,953
Will you be okay without the OS?

616
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,126
I don’t think any are lodged in deep.

617
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,610
But, even so, we can't look for it
after we close it.

618
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,640
Scalpel.

619
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,880
We don’t have time for General
surgery or Orthopedic surgery.

620
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,439
We’ll just have to open every part.

621
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,785
Is that how you did it over there?

622
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,031
We don’t have CT or X-ray,

623
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,021
so we just open all of it first and see.

624
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,254
If there are military bases nearby,

625
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,791
we borrow and use their metal detectors.

626
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Use metal detectors to find bullets?

627
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,487
Oh wow, that’s a good idea.

628
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,752
Tens of people die there on a daily basis.

629
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,253
Whatever we may use...

630
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,784
we must improvise.

631
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,520
There is no respect for life or
human presence there.

632
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,850
We only think of not dying and
how to endure hardships.

633
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,190
We just take it one day at a time.

634
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,089
Isn’t it funny how
a different world exists

635
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,360
even when we live in the same time?

636
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,180
How many does that make?

637
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,405
Total of 13.

638
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,320
With that, total of 14.

639
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,310
We got everything.

640
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,173
Then, let's finish up.

641
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,943
Bicri number 3.

642
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,817
You’re really good at that.

643
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,747
Your teacher must’ve taught you well.

644
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,188
I just learned from watching him.

645
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,387
Then the student is the great one.

646
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,940
Thank you.

647
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,357
Cut.

648
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,306
Cut.

649
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,370
Young-Jo.

650
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,654
Do you want a cup of coffee?

651
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,553
Sounds good.

652
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,584
Drink it.

653
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,920
It's good.

654
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,766
At the last volunteer region I went to,

655
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,801
a bomb exploded.

656
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,846
Every one of my co-workers died...

657
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,280
But...

658
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,820
but strangely, I didn’t shed
a single tear.

659
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,978
Just...

660
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,500
I was just angry.

661
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,367
Why did this happen to me,

662
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,598
what did I do wrong...

663
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,639
I began to hate people,
and I've become scared of them.

664
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,134
The beginning wasn’t like this...

665
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,584
I think I...

666
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,743
I lost my way.

667
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,048
If you really did lose your way...

668
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,803
then you wouldn’t have
brought that patient here.

669
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,994
I think it’s like a habit...

670
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
It was my job before...

671
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,105
just like before...

672
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,420
I wouldn’t know what to do if
I didn’t do that, at least.

673
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,572
And...

674
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,695
I wanted to see you too.

675
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,322
How about you?

676
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,965
How are you doing?

677
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,795
Are you doing alright here?

678
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,934
Me?

679
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,448
Well...

680
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,190
Watching movies,

681
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,779
looking around for famous food places,

682
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:49,547
and even drinking coffee with
a woman he likes...

683
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,153
A fool who thought those were
a waste of time...

684
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,865
Isn't this an improvement?

685
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,855
Is it?

686
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,599
I guess so...

687
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,701
Do you need it?

688
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,882
Can you lend it to me?

689
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,159
Why did we...

690
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,301
let those times go?

691
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,943
Cheer up, Yoon Seo-Jung.

692
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,076
You can do this.

693
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,171
Like a confident and cool person.

694
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,150
What are you doing?

695
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,283
I was waiting for you.

696
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,569
I have something to tell you.

697
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,986
Oh, really?

698
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,304
Me too.

699
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,168
I have something to tell you, too.

700
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,551
What is it?

701
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,151
Do you want to...

702
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,354
go on a date?

703
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,713
A date?

704
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,514
To where?

705
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,640
Let’s go.

706
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,841
Oh, here!

707
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,280
Teacher Kim’s name needs to show.

708
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,750
Good timing, Teacher Kim.
Let’s take a picture together.

709
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,065
-I don’t want to.
-Just one, please.

710
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,230
One, two, three.

711
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,740
At a good angle...

712
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,630
Oh yes, tilt at a 45 degree angle.

713
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,578
One, two, three.

714
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,540
In front of the stairs.

715
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,580
One, two, three.

716
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,590
Let’s take a picture together,
Section Chief Jang.

717
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,280
One, two, three.

718
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,090
That’s a pretty pose.

719
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,919
Famous designer Andre Kim is
watching you.

720
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,186
Here we go.

721
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:36,810
Are you taking picture of me?

722
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,400
One, two, three!

723
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,540
-Take a picture of me too.
-Okay.

724
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,850
Nurse Oh!

725
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,440
Let’s take a picture.

726
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,180
You shouldn’t do this here...

727
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,180
One, two, three.

728
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,190
Hey, what are you doing?

729
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,030
On to the next location!

730
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,190
Director!

731
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,200
Director, please take a picture with us.

732
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,460
One, two, three!

733
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,688
Dr Yoon.

734
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,202
This place should do it. It's perfect.

735
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,948
Isn’t it a bit dark in here?

736
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,176
It will still come out good
even if it’s dark.

737
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,351
Here we go.

738
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,128
One, two, three.

739
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,590
It turned out great. Look at it.

740
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,195
Anyway,

741
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,841
Can I ask what you are doing?

742
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,946
I told you, we’re on a date.

743
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:47,495
What is it?

744
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,188
Why are we suddenly taking
so many pictures?

745
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,373
I'm...

746
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,982
going to let you go...

747
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,581
Oh, but...

748
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,893
I didn't have any pictures with you.

749
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,370
We didn’t even get to go on
a proper date...

750
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,120
That's why.

751
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,799
Where are you sending me to?

752
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,172
To be honest,

753
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,472
I saw the letter.

754
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,399
I didn’t see it on purpose,

755
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,246
but I just happened to see it
in your book...

756
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,746
So, what?

757
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,331
Don’t worry about me.

758
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,110
Look at Teacher Kim and Lee Yong-Jo.

759
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,600
They like each other deeply, but
still respect each other's separate ways.

760
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,700
I think we can do that too.

761
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,610
You are driving me crazy.

762
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,684
There’s no need for that.

763
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,209
I am okay, really.

764
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,501
How much of the letter did you see?

765
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,816
Just the envelope with the hospital name.

766
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,228
Why?

767
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,103
Here, look.

768
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:27,792
Not there, but below that.

769
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,990
Sorry?

770
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,932
Sorry.

771
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,265
Right? Sorry.

772
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,090
Do you see it?

773
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,532
What is this?

774
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,036
No way...

775
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,769
Is this a rejection letter?

776
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,905
Yes.

777
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,610
Oh my...

778
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,027
Did you get rejected?

779
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,826
That’s good to hear.

780
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,746
Good to hear?

781
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,475
I was...

782
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,444
I was embarrassed so I was hiding it,

783
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,068
but you misunderstood me and even
planned to send me away?

784
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,050
So...

785
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,146
You’re not going to leave?

786
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,978
No, wait.

787
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,693
You can't even go, right?

788
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,278
Even if I did get accepted,
I wouldn't go alone.

789
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,522
Why would you send me away
if you like me?

790
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,549
You should go with me or
stay here together.

791
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,757
But, still...

792
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,999
If we need to go our separate ways,

793
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,617
we could break up.

794
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,826
Do you live a hundred,
a thousand years, Dr Yoon?

795
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,453
Why would we live separated
when we don’t even live for long?

796
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,960
Well, if that’s going to benefit us...

797
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,220
then we could...

798
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,649
You are so stubborn and old-school.

799
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,678
Why are you thinking in such an old way?

800
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,405
You’re the one that is out of style.

801
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,135
Kids these days will think what
you’re saying is restraint.

802
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,256
Restraining.

803
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,591
Haven’t you heard of
beautiful restriction?

804
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,870
I think that is an old song too...

805
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,849
Anyway...

806
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,618
I feel hurt, really.

807
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,230
I love you.

808
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,078
Whatever.

809
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:30,786
What did you just say?

810
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,311
Wait.

811
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,742
I think you said something just now.

812
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,214
What did I say?

813
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,035
I didn’t hear it that well...

814
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,443
Please say it one more time.

815
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,711
No, I didn’t say anything.

816
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,642
-Sorry?
-No, not sorry.

817
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,140
-Dr Kang, sorry.
-No, not Dr Kang.

818
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,690
-Starts with I love...
-I don’t think so.

819
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,590
-Hurry.
-I didn't.

820
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,780
I didn’t get to hear it.

821
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,490
I didn't say anything.

822
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,590
-It's for real.
-Hurry.

823
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,530
I am going to keep tickling you.

824
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,979
No, no. I'm sorry. Sorry.

825
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,120
There is a patient here!

826
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,060
To the hybrid room.

827
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,950
Guardian of Jung Hee-Jung.

828
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,210
-Yes?
-Please come in.

829
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,440
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

830
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,150
I was wondering...

831
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,212
How did you and Teacher Kim first meet?

832
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,893
Can you keep a secret?

833
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,839
Of course.

834
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,776
At a police station.

835
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,453
Police...station?

836
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,530
Miss Oh Myung-shim.

837
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:23,020
How can you slap a patient?
You’re a nurse.

838
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,599
My goodness, then should I just
let it go when he groped by butt?

839
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,090
That’s too far even if he is a
drunk patient...

840
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,920
When did I ever do that?

841
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,290
You did do that!

842
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,120
-Do you have any evidence?
-You did!

843
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,760
-Stay away!
-Sir, stop.

844
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:41,370
Doctor, how can you hit them
despite all that?

845
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:47,609
How can I stand by when those two punks
were trying to rob this kid?

846
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,000
The world is so harsh.

847
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,959
Fine.

848
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,546
Why were you getting beat up?

849
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,648
Excuse me!

850
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,591
There is something wrong with this man!

851
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,441
Get him to be quiet!

852
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,949
I think that man is dead.

853
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,249
Hey, you.

854
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,332
Hey.

855
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,293
Mister.

856
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,566
Mister.

857
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,211
There’s blood!

858
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,357
You and you...help me move this man.

859
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,750
Who are you? Are you a doctor?

860
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,950
Yes, I am a doctor.

861
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,320
So, hurry up and move him.

862
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,220
Yes.

863
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,330
Carefully.

864
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,582
Careful, Careful...lay him down here.

865
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,386
Is there a first aid kit here?

866
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,679
Get me some gauze,

867
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,707
Hurry!

868
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,467
There is no gauze here,
but I have a handkerchief.

869
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,430
Okay.

870
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,812
We need to stop the bleeding.

871
00:58:58,770 --> 00:58:59,773
Take that off.

872
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,243
Here.

873
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,335
Pull it tight here.

874
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,503
Yes.

875
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,966
If we don’t repair it soon, he will
be in danger due to blood loss.

876
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:14,327
Is there a hospital nearby?

877
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,660
There is a hospital that I work at
about 5 minutes away from here.

878
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,080
Is there suture set and houpper there?

879
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,285
Yes.

880
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,950
Can they perform arteriorrhaphy?

881
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,139
If there is a person who can perform that
procedure, then it's possible.

882
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,862
Of course, I can.

883
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,992
What is your name?

884
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,011
I am Nurse Oh Myung-shim.

885
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,339
And you?

886
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,183
I am Teacher Kim.

887
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:44,140
Teacher?

888
00:59:44,518 --> 00:59:45,441
I see...
