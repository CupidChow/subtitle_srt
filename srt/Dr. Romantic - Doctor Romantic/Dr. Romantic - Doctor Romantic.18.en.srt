1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,686
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,331
Yes, hello?

3
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,200
It's me, Oh Sung-jae.

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,972
So, if I tell you that I do have
the courage to reveal that truth...

5
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,043
...can you tell me the truth?

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,448
Dr Bu Yong-joo?

7
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:57,724
Sometimes, in life, it takes time
for you to be able to see the truth.

8
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,330
Such as the reasons why
those things happened to me.

9
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,368
Why I'd met someone like that.

10
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,807
Why I'd taken a detour like that.

11
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,020
Which department are
you a part of, Doctor?

12
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,896
Are you close with Dr Bu Yong-joo?

13
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,133
The countless moments that
I'd deemed insignificant...

14
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,835
It's you, isn't it?

15
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,638
The person from that time.

16
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,474
Dr Bu Yong-joo.

17
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,845
Everything starts to become
significant, one by one.

18
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,716
Why do you keep asking me
about Bu Yong-joo?

19
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,484
What is it that you want to know, exactly?

20
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,453
He's someone whom I respect.

21
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,458
I want to learn from you, Doctor.

22
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,562
Studying hard and becoming
someone like him is my dream.

23
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,401
Doing a joint surgery
with you is my dream.

24
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,972
And they started to pave
a path, at one point.

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,978
Will you tell me what
the truth is, already?

26
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:29,049
Will you tell me what really
happened 14 years ago,

27
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,520
as well as why
Jang Hyun-joo died like that,

28
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,557
and why Dr Bu Yong-joo quit working
at the main hospital overnight?

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,333
There's no "truth."

30
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,871
14 years ago, Bu Yong-joo was...

31
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,777
...a coward and fell silent.

32
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,082
And he ran away.

33
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,987
That's all there is to it.

34
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,475
EPISODE 18
Whether You Want It or Not

35
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,756
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
Establishing Emergency Trauma Center

36
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,663
Proposal by Teacher Kim, Chief of
Surgical Department at Doldam Hospital

37
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,963
Let's talk for a bit, Section Chief Jang.

38
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,234
Yes, I'll step out for a bit, then.

39
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,504
What is it?

40
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,943
Were you the one who handed over
Teacher Kim's documents to Director Do?

41
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,977
Why...

42
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,146
...do you think that was me?

43
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,115
Had you already been convinced by them,

44
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:12,786
when you were promoted to Section Chief
as soon as Chief Song came here?

45
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,122
How could you accuse me of such things?

46
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,459
Being promoted was, to an extent,
due to my own performance.

47
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,694
Oh, really?

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,063
Why did you go into Teacher Kim's
office that day, then?

49
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,290
What do you mean, "That day"?

50
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,666
When?

51
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,069
Section Chief.

52
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,573
Dr Yoon told me that you told
her you were emptying out his trash.

53
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,008
But that doesn't quite
make sense, doesn't it?

54
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,610
Why not?

55
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,978
Am I...

56
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,380
...not allowed to empty people's
trash bins for them?

57
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,484
You think I don't know you,
Mr Jang Ki-tae?

58
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,386
You said that you were
pampered as a child,

59
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,922
and never even sorted the trash properly!

60
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,392
You didn't even toss out the wooden
chopsticks you used to eat cup noodles!

61
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,728
And yet, you emptied out a trash bin?

62
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,331
And one in someone else's office, at that?

63
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,001
Look at me in the eye.

64
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,304
Look straight into my eyes and tell me!

65
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,976
You were the one who gave him
Teacher Kim's documents, weren't you?

66
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,877
No!

67
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,878
Are you sure?

68
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,979
It wasn't me!

69
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:15,616
I really am innocent this time!

70
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,351
Then, who?

71
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,087
Who handed those documents
over to Director Do?

72
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,555
Who?

73
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,159
I don't know anything.

74
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,430
I don't remember a thing.

75
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,900
Do you think you're in the courtroom?

76
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,936
I told you, I'm just here for udon.

77
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,473
Just give me some udon.

78
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,995
CASINO OWNER CHAIRMAN SHIN MYUNG-HO
HAS BECOME BRAIN DEAD...

79
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,622
after his artificial heart transplant
surgery at Doldam Hospital.

80
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,200
SUBMIT

81
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,374
BULLETIN BOARD FOR
DAEGUK INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES

82
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:26,216
How's the chairman doing?

83
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,754
Is he displaying pain responses?

84
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,823
No, he's not responsive yet.

85
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,726
He should've woken up by now.

86
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,233
Approximately 24 hours have
passed since the surgery was done.

87
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,069
The fact that he still hasn't woken up yet
definitely means that there's...

88
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,105
...an issue with his brain.

89
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,374
And in the worst case scenario,

90
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,210
we'll have to shut down Doldam Hospital.

91
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,617
There won't be a need to have him treated
at a hospital that will be closed down.

92
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,419
But still, you're going to shut down
a hospital just because of that?

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,593
Rumors regarding the chairman have already
begun to circulate in the stock markets.

94
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,695
FROM: SUNG IN-CHUL OF
DAEGUK INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES

95
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,963
Brain dead?

96
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,967
Who's spreading these baseless rumors?

97
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:20,207
People care more about
thrilling rumors than the facts.

98
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,378
You have to think of what's best for
the chairman from this point onward.

99
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,947
We don't have a moment to lose.

100
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,153
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

101
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,355
Where did you say you were from?

102
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,324
Well...

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
...I'm not sure.

104
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,727
One moment.

105
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,930
Nurse Oh, it's a reporter.

106
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,133
They asked if Chairman Shin's
surgery was performed here.

107
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,537
Hello, this is the hospital's ER.

108
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,173
We don't know much about things like that.

109
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,120
It'd be best for you to direct your
inquiry to the Administrative Office.

110
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,248
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

111
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,383
Oh, just one moment.

112
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,919
These people are asking about
the same thing, Nurse Oh.

113
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,098
They say that they're reporters and
are asking about Chairman Shin.

114
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,290
Hello, this is the hospital's ER.

115
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,826
We only take calls regarding
emergency patients!

116
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,530
What if your call prevents a call about
an actual patient from getting through?

117
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,131
I said I don't know.

118
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't call back.

119
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,276
What's going on, Nurse Oh?

120
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,213
I think that there's a rumor
going around online, Nurse Oh.

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,115
A rumor going around online?

122
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,843
CASINO OWNER CHAIRMAN SHIN MYUNG-HO
HAS BECOME BRAIN DEAD...

123
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,923
What do you mean?

124
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,825
What's going on?

125
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,026
What do you mean?

126
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:50,130
A post saying that the chairman is
brain dead is spreading on social media.

127
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,665
How could a groundless rumor...

128
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,300
No, it's not like that at all.

129
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,736
I told you,
we can't tell you such things!

130
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,104
Good day, sir!

131
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,307
What is going on?

132
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,542
I'm not sure, either.

133
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,544
I feel as if we've been hit by a bomb!

134
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,078
What's the commotion about?

135
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,747
I told you, it's really not!

136
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,615
What's going on?

137
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,950
It's nothing.

138
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,586
There are some bad rumors
regarding Chairman Shin's surgery...

139
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,555
...spreading on social media.

140
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,090
Reporters have gotten wind of it
and are calling us to confirm.

141
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,358
Don't worry.

142
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,661
I'll block them like an iron barricade.

143
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,806
Oh, you're here, Mr Director?

144
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,608
Is Director Yeo in his office?

145
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,976
Well,

146
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,811
is Director Yeo upstairs right now?

147
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,981
The director is out right now.

148
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,488
Yes, Section Chief Jang? What is it?

149
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,458
Director Do from the main hospital is
here right now.

150
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,659
Just a moment.

151
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,731
It's me, Director Yeo.

152
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,600
What brings you to Doldam
without any prior notice?

153
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,935
I've come to give you one final message.

154
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,742
The Doldam branch of our hospitals
will soon be shut down.

155
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,217
We'll make that decision at
the provisional board meeting tomorrow.

156
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:23,023
So stop stalling for time, and get
Chairman Shin to the main hospital.

157
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,362
If you want a position at the new assisted
care facility we'll be building,

158
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,365
it'd be best for you to do as I say.

159
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,035
I've said what I needed to say,
so I'll be hanging up now.

160
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,805
I'll go see Chairman Shin
since I'm already here.

161
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,474
Director Do. Director Do?

162
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,809
Has it really been decided that
Doldam will be shut down?

163
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,045
This means I can go back to
the main hospital, right?

164
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,547
Right?

165
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,650
Teacher Kim.

166
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,592
What do you mean, they've decided to
shut Doldam Hospital down?

167
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,929
Apparently Director Do just
came by and said that.

168
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,632
Nurse Oh and everyone else
are in a state of panic right now.

169
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,201
What will we do, then?

170
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,637
And what will happen to
everyone at the hospital?

171
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,944
Come back to Seoul now.

172
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:21,048
Tomorrow, the decision to close
this place down will be made,

173
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,418
and the decision will be implemented
as soon as it is made.

174
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,919
Why...

175
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,622
...do you have to go so far?

176
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,795
What is the reason you
must go to such lengths?

177
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:40,234
Because the Foundation feels that
this place is an old and useless hospital.

178
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,803
Useless?

179
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,940
Chairman Shin will be transferred to
the main hospital by the end of today.

180
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:51,478
It'd be nice if you came with him
and watched over him.

181
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,147
I'll assign you to him, so...

182
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:59,753
...come back
to the main hospital now, okay?

183
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,901
Shutting down the hospital?

184
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,004
What on earth are you trying to do, here?

185
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,773
You locked my father up in there
while waving that document in my face,

186
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,976
so as his daughter,
I can't just sit and watch.

187
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,179
I have to move Father to
the main hospital,

188
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,548
even if I have to
shut Doldam down to do it.

189
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,452
Look here, Ms Director.

190
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:38,492
Do you even know how many
flock to Jungsun...

191
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,296
...just because of the casino
that you people built here?

192
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,599
Approximately 8,500 per day!

193
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,801
On top of that,

194
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:53,140
there are at least 30 to 40 traffic
accident patients per week in the ER.

195
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:58,879
So what are all those people to do
if you get rid of the hospital?

196
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:04,418
Are you telling them to go from hospital
to hospital because there's no ER here...

197
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,921
...until they just die on
the side of the road?

198
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,191
Director Do told me that
you people cost us...

199
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,827
...over a million dollars in
deficits every year.

200
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,531
And this year, there was
a 1.5 million dollars deficit.

201
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:21,935
So you're going to talk about some money
when I'm talking about the injured?

202
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:27,708
The Geosan University Foundation no longer
wishes to cover Doldam's deficits.

203
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,979
Your father received
surgery at that hospital.

204
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,982
And it's at that hospital where he lies,
still unconscious.

205
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,750
72...

206
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,155
No, you can't even wait 48 hours?

207
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,991
48 hours?

208
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,127
They said that the longer
he remains unconscious,

209
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,329
the greater the chance of him
becoming brain-dead!

210
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,290
And who told you that
he'd become brain-dead?

211
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:55,469
I, his primary doctor, never said so,
so who the heck told you that?

212
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:06,013
Is money the only thing that you
people care about right now?

213
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,249
Are you weighing the pros
and cons of having him die,

214
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,652
versus having him hang on for
a bit longer?

215
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,354
And wondering which scenario
would help you inherit his fortune?

216
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,291
Aren't you out of your mind?

217
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,592
If that's not the case...

218
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:23,096
...shut your mouth and just do as I say.

219
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:30,671
You can decide to shut down the hospital
or whatever after I save your father!

220
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,483
They're not really going to shut
this place down, are they?

221
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,319
Geez, this is driving me crazy.

222
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,887
It's looking quite grim.

223
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:47,788
What do we do?

224
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,057
Do I need to find another job?

225
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,425
Oh, it's Nurse Oh.

226
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,666
What happened, Nurse Oh?
Is our hospital really shutting down?

227
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,969
Nothing has been decided yet.

228
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,671
Just focus on work and
act as you always have.

229
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,975
How could you focus on work
at a time like this, Nurse Oh?

230
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,845
I told you that it doesn't hurt!

231
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,547
I'm going home!

232
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:16,683
You told me that your
stomach hurt a lot before, sir.

233
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,685
We have to get you a CT scan, at least.

234
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,287
What's going on?

235
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,690
He had too much to drink and
he kept saying that his stomach hurt.

236
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,226
So I told him that we'd get
a CT scan of him, but he refuses.

237
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,495
I told you, I'm not getting a scan!

238
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,599
Why would I waste money to
get that kind of thing done?

239
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,837
If I had money for that,
I would've gotten another drink instead.

240
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,338
Sir.

241
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,307
Please listen to what
the doctor is saying.

242
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,543
I told you, I'm not a patient!

243
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,912
Get out of my way. I'm going home.

244
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,879
Sir.

245
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,582
Let go! Get out of my way!

246
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,684
Get out of my way!

247
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,685
What should we do?

248
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,787
Shouldn't we prevent him from leaving?

249
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,156
Just leave him alone.

250
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,226
We get plenty of
drunken patients like that.

251
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,781
What are you doing?

252
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,252
Well, I was just resting for a bit.

253
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,920
I should go back in there now.

254
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,128
Are you okay?

255
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,967
The hospital may be closing down...

256
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,171
...so of course I'm not.

257
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:51,945
What's this?

258
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,815
It belongs to Teacher Kim.

259
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:59,987
This was the big picture that
Teacher Kim was working on.

260
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,790
Did you know about this too?

261
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,493
No.

262
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,195
I had no idea.

263
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:09,897
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
Establishing Emergency Trauma Center

264
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:13,433
So this is what he was thinking about.

265
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,536
Yes.

266
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,108
What do we do now?

267
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,345
I don't know.

268
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,900
Director Yeo.

269
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,436
Are you okay?

270
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:03,717
Well, this won't really affect me.

271
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:10,023
I'm just a powerless person
who has taken a back seat, after all.

272
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:14,828
But still, I wanted to become an adult,

273
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:20,434
who sided with justice and give
that justice some strength to act.

274
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,504
What do you mean by that?

275
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,273
Just a moment ago,

276
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,279
I just received word that
Doldam Hospital will be shut down.

277
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,582
From Director Do Yoon-wan.

278
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,553
Isn't it strange?

279
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:44,291
We all know that
Do Yoon-wan is in the wrong.

280
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,395
Everyone knows that what
he's doing right now is wrong.

281
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:55,202
So why does he still maintain
a position of such power?

282
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,148
Thank you for the udon.

283
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,764
Looks like you were off somewhere.

284
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:28,569
Geosan is sending an ambulance
and some staff to escort Chairman Shin.

285
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:29,776
Oh!

286
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,705
They should be here any moment now.

287
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:33,974
With whose permission?

288
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,411
Who else's? Director Do's, of course.

289
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,447
Just give up now.

290
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:45,419
The decision to have this place
shut down will be made tomorrow, anyway.

291
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:51,091
You don't still believe that
Chairman Shin will wake up, do you?

292
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,194
Oh, come on.

293
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,829
Section Chief Jang.

294
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,030
Yes, Teacher Kim?

295
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:01,268
Take out this trash, will you?

296
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,603
What? Trash?

297
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:09,669
Also, make sure that none of
those guys from Seoul get in here.

298
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,778
Did you just call me "trash"?

299
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,982
Of course you are.

300
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:19,920
Since the one who calls himself a doctor
is praying for a patient to not wake up!

301
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,689
I'm just letting you know that
it's game over for you!

302
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,025
I just feel bad watching
as you desperately insist...

303
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,827
...on trying to extend his life
when there's no hope!

304
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,295
I don't care who they are.

305
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:33,000
Just see what happens
if they come near the ICU.

306
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,970
I'll sue them all.

307
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:38,705
Got that?

308
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,774
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,050
Look here, Section Chief Jang!

310
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:51,552
"Yes"?

311
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,754
You can't be saying that!

312
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,724
You'd better hurry up and choose
your side properly, now!

313
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,560
Figure out who you're loyal to
Doldam or Geosan!

314
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,460
Okay?

315
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,696
Yes, sir.

316
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,871
Seriously!

317
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,819
I'm so angry.

318
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,422
It took so much hard work
and effort for us to get this far.

319
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:06,960
Teacher Kim and the rest of us...

320
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,232
...worked so hard to get this far.

321
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,968
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
Establishing Emergency Trauma Center

322
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:57,144
I'll be checking your pain
response now, Mr Chairman.

323
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,451
I can't just give up, right?

324
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:09,489
So please, wake up.

325
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,126
Please, Mr Chairman.

326
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,075
Nurse Uhm, regarding
Patient Lee Kang Jin...

327
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:38,385
I wonder if I'll get paid
for my work this month.

328
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:40,532
I know, I really had a hard time
to get an apartment.

329
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:52,266
Nurse Uhm!

330
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:53,233
Huh?

331
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,334
Yes.

332
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,702
Aren't you going to pick up?

333
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,038
They've only been calls about
Chairman Shin all day, so...

334
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,507
But what if it's a call
regarding a patient?

335
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,148
Yes, this is the ER at Doldam Hospital.

336
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,319
Yes, I understand.

337
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:16,223
We have a patient with a glass shard
in his abdomen coming in five minutes.

338
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,797
Didn't you hear me say that
a patient is coming in?

339
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,804
What's with you all?

340
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:34,374
Why are you all just staring at me?

341
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,312
We heard that Doldam Hospital
may be closing down.

342
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,448
Nobody can seem to focus on work
because we're all so worried.

343
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:45,619
Will the hospital really be shutting down?

344
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,922
I want to hear it from
you directly, Doctor.

345
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:50,657
Please, tell us.

346
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,905
That's what I want to ask you all.

347
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:10,711
Have you all decided to shut
Doldam Hospital down already?

348
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,045
That's not it...

349
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,680
If that's not it,

350
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:18,252
why are you all acting as if
the hospital is already closed?

351
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,521
Nurse Oh.

352
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:24,491
Why are you hunched over like that?

353
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:33,267
I have no intention of
shutting down this hospital.

354
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:38,472
I stood here yesterday and today,

355
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,241
and plan to do so tomorrow, too,

356
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:45,546
and wait for the patients
who need my help.

357
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:50,851
That's what I've decided, Kang Dong-joo.

358
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:54,655
-Doctor.
-So just act as you usually do.

359
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:59,493
Let's just focus on the patients as
we all usually do, Kang Dong-joo.

360
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,836
We have an emergency patient!

361
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:12,906
He's a 37-year-old man and has
a piece of glass stuck in his abdomen.

362
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,551
What happened?

363
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:27,421
Oh, he climbed a ladder to try
and swap out a light fixture,

364
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:29,189
and he fell toward a window.

365
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,191
The glass got stuck in
his stomach as it shattered.

366
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,559
We'll move him to the hybrid room.

367
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,694
Okay.

368
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:39,867
Nurse Uhm.

369
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,034
Yes?

370
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,002
Yes.

371
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:51,879
Teacher Kim said that the scariest
thing to do is act as you normally do,

372
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:57,885
instead of backing down
in the face of uncertainty and fear.

373
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,854
Dr Yeon-hwa.

374
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,755
The patient's clothes, please.

375
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:02,990
Oh, of course!

376
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,158
His vitals are 119/70, with 70 bpm...

377
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:06,827
Oh! Dr Yeon-hwa!

378
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,609
This is why you don't tear
into padded clothing.

379
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,111
I'm so sorry!

380
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,679
I didn't know!

381
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,714
Can I get a D-set?
I'll take a look at his wound.

382
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:28,715
Yes, Doctor.

383
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,150
I'm sorry!

384
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,919
Put two lines in him and one liter of
a full drop saline solution.

385
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,420
Give him a tetanus shot,
some antibiotics,

386
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,454
and let's also get a CT scan of him.

387
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,689
Yes, sir.

388
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:44,698
Teacher Kim may have already known...

389
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:47,534
...that our worries and fears...

390
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:52,372
...could become
even lighter than feathers.

391
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,274
Yes, what is it?

392
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,536
Oh, come in, come in!

393
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:48,229
I got your call and was waiting for you.

394
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,566
Oh, good thing you're here,
Section Chief Jang.

395
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,168
Will you escort them, please?

396
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:01,975
What are you doing?

397
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,944
I told you to hurry up and escort them!

398
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,554
What are you doing right now?

399
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,260
Teacher Kim ordered us to not let
a single person pass through.

400
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,496
None of you may go upstairs.

401
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,132
What? Why, you...

402
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:26,600
Step aside.

403
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,935
Step aside right now!

404
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,270
I can't.

405
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:33,507
No, I won't.

406
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:35,549
Why, you!

407
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,181
Oh?

408
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,085
Eh?

409
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,856
Wow, are you serious?

410
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,101
Seo-Jung.

411
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,537
You said that the chairman is conscious?

412
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,571
Yes, Doctor.

413
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,772
He's nearly alert.

414
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,208
I think he's about a 10 on the GCS scale.

415
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:19,786
Mr Chairman.

416
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,256
Can you hear my voice?

417
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:38,138
Mr Chairman.

418
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:44,378
If you can hear my voice,
please move your hand a bit.

419
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,184
Mr Chairman.

420
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,369
Doctor!

421
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,383
What do you mean?

422
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:58,537
They've blocked you off
so that you can't get in?

423
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:04,224
That ass Teacher Kim ordered them not to
let anyone into the ICU!

424
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:09,129
Even this Section Chief of
Administration is blocking the path!

425
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:12,032
Is that Director Do, by any chance?

426
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:14,101
Yes, Director!

427
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:17,404
We promoted him to Section Chief,
yet he's acting so ungrateful.

428
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:20,007
I'm so appalled!

429
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:22,943
We have no more time to lose,

430
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,044
so force your way through.

431
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,445
Escort the chairman out of there,

432
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:26,880
even if you have to use force.

433
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:27,781
Now!

434
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:28,815
Yes, sir.

435
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,684
I'll do that.

436
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,358
Okay, let's prepare ourselves.

437
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,094
You go up this way,

438
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,129
and you go up that way.

439
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,664
And you go up this way.

440
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,067
Man...

441
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,536
I really wasn't going to do this, but...

442
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:04,518
-Go!
-Go!

443
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,219
What are you doing right now?

444
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:13,253
What else?

445
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,155
We're on our way to go escort
Chairman Shin,

446
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,724
as we were ordered to.

447
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,593
Are you people some neighborhood thugs?

448
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,030
What the heck are you people
doing at a hospital?

449
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,967
So why did you tell him to block us off?

450
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:30,370
You think I'm doing this
because I want to, at this age?

451
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,039
Shut your mouth,

452
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,341
And all of you,

453
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,109
get the heck out of here.

454
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,744
Wow, how frustrating.

455
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:40,714
I told you, we have to
escort Chairman Shin!

456
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,115
He's awake now.

457
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,016
Exactly!

458
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,518
He's awake now, so we...

459
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,320
Wait, he woke up?

460
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,997
The chairman is awake now.

461
00:34:57,064 --> 00:35:01,435
So shut your mouth quietly,
and disappear from this hospital. Now.

462
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,736
Got it?

463
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,740
Father did?

464
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,111
The chairman...

465
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:12,713
...woke up?

466
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,548
Okay.

467
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,984
No, no... I'm heading there now.

468
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:18,552
Father is awake now.

469
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,154
He recognizes everyone
and he's fully conscious.

470
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,499
How's Father?

471
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,035
Go inside, ma'am.

472
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:40,707
Mr Chairman!

473
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,710
How are you feeling, Mr Chairman?

474
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:51,251
Did the surgery go well?

475
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,886
Of course.

476
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:55,422
It went perfectly well, Mr Chairman.

477
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,860
Good job, Teacher Kim.

478
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,812
Father.

479
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,149
Are you okay?

480
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,217
Yeah.

481
00:36:23,884 --> 00:36:25,085
I'm okay.

482
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:27,321
Father!

483
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:30,724
Do you know how worried I was?

484
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:34,862
Thanks, Dad.

485
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,037
I'm okay.

486
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,779
I'm okay. I'm okay.

487
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:09,863
Doctor.

488
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,213
That impudent little brat...

489
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,058
What will you do now, Director?

490
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,327
The chairman is awake now, so...

491
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,976
At any rate, we'll have
the staff who were sent here...

492
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:57,744
...return to Seoul tomorrow, as planned.

493
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,413
And I'll return to the main
hospital tomorrow as well.

494
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,380
No.

495
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:02,049
Stay here for now.

496
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,383
What?

497
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,153
This game isn't over yet.

498
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,187
So stay here,

499
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:11,425
and know that you'll be buried here
if Doldam isn't shut down.

500
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:18,565
Buried here?

501
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,507
I'm sorry, Honey!

502
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:28,442
I was told that I'd be going back to
the main hospital tomorrow,

503
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,110
so I'd even packed all my bags!

504
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,846
But the decision was reversed
all of the sudden, so...

505
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,616
I'm really upset, too!

506
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:36,884
You think I'm here because I want to be...

507
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,452
Hello? Hello?

508
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,621
Just who was I even talking to?

509
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,289
Oh no...

510
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:44,424
Looks like your wife is really mad.

511
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,926
I have two choices now.

512
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:49,830
Submit a letter of resignation,
or have her divorce me.

513
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:52,966
Can't she just come and live here?

514
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:54,868
She's already looking into
kindergartens for my daughter,

515
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,104
even though she just learned how to walk.

516
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,173
Oh, so she won't come, then.

517
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:05,212
I'll buy you some beer at Come and Go
when we get out of work today.

518
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,146
I'm in!

519
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,414
Me too!

520
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:09,950
Does that place even have
good food, though?

521
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,252
Dr Nam's ramen with
rice cakes is delicious.

522
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,955
His signature dish is
ramen with rice cakes?

523
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,090
Well, no. Maybe beer?

524
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:24,965
What do you want?

525
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:31,972
I heard that the CT scan for the patient
with the glass in his abdomen is done.

526
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,719
Want to come and take
a look at it with me?

527
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,311
This isn't really
a common case, after all.

528
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:42,049
We can look at it together, and it'd be
even better if you'd assist for me.

529
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,517
What do you mean?

530
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,886
What do you mean?

531
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:51,725
Everyone is having a hard time
right now because of my father.

532
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:52,759
So what?

533
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:55,662
So I'm sure that people don't want
to see my face around, either.

534
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,333
To be honest,

535
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,569
I really can't stand
seeing Director Do's face.

536
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:07,808
But that's not your fault.

537
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:14,314
I'd be super embarrassed if I were you
and my father was acting like that.

538
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:15,816
Are you trying to insult me again?

539
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:16,950
Forget about that.

540
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,353
So are you going to assist me, or not?

541
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,488
The patient is waiting.

542
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:23,490
Hurry up and decide, okay?

543
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,628
Never mind if you don't want to!

544
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:29,496
Oh, fine! Okay!

545
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,400
Geez, you sure take advantage
of people like crazy!

546
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,103
Hey, you have to assist me
next time, okay?

547
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,371
You got that?

548
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,149
Seriously...

549
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,485
Dr Kang Dong-joo!

550
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,819
I was just on my way to see you.

551
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,056
A piece of registered mail for you
came from Geosan University Hospital.

552
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,424
Registered mail?

553
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,625
For me?

554
00:40:58,692 --> 00:40:59,593
Yes, sir.

555
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,499

DR BU YONG-JOO DATE: APRIL 29TH, 2002

557
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:14,308
April 29th...

558
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:18,612
Who sent this?

559
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,880
I'm not sure.

560
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,684
It's from the main hospital,
so I didn't check to see who it was from.

561
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:33,260
Did you send the thing I told
you to send yesterday?

562
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,528
Yes, Director.

563
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,330
I sent it as registered mail.

564
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,198
It should have arrived there today.

565
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,701
Okay, that'll be all. You can leave now.

566
00:41:44,304 --> 00:41:48,709
The scariest thing is a seed of doubt.

567
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:53,380
If you just scatter it, it grows well
without any effort on your part.

SURGEON: BU YONG-JOO
FIRST ASSISTANT: KANG TAE-WOOK

569
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,218
Mr Kang Won-young has passed away.

570
00:41:58,418 --> 00:41:59,453
Father...

571
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:04,424
Father!

572
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,593
Oh, Honey!

573
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,539
SURGEON: BU YONG-JOO

574
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:24,344
I'll check on him one more time later.

575
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,446
Borders meeting members won't
be discussing...

576
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:28,615
...the closure of Doldam
for the time being.

577
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:34,354
You know that you're only safe
as long as Father is here, right?

578
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:35,822
Yes.

579
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,791
Of course.

580
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:41,094
To be honest,
I still can't acknowledge you.

581
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:45,933
But I truly thank you for
what you did this time.

582
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,135
I mean it.

583
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,639
Sure.

584
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:56,710
I don't only care about my inheritance
and such because I'm rich.

585
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:59,613
As for me,

586
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:05,819
I just want to live under
my father's shadow for a long, long time.

587
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,656
So I'd like it if Father lived
a long time.

588
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:14,294
I'm heading back to Florida for
a bit because of my kids,

589
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,496
but I'll be back early next month.

590
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:21,335
So please take good care
of my father until then.

591
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:22,970
Yes, have a safe trip.

592
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,738
Well, goodbye, then.

593
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:28,642
Oh, I have one thing I'm curious about.

594
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,844
Yes?

595
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:35,249
How did you decide on
the name "Teacher Kim"?

596
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,423
What's your name, Doctor?

597
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:44,925
Me?

598
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:51,265
I have a really plain and common name.

599
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:54,067
It's Kim something...

600
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,237
Oh, I see, Dr Kim Something.

601
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,606
Dr Kim Something!

602
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:01,108
Are you busy right now?

603
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:02,442
What?

604
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,978
When you're doing a
Billroth II gastrectomy,

605
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:07,881
do you just leave
the front part obstructed?

606
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,656
I'm just curious.

607
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,393
Dr Kim Something!

608
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:23,130
Are you leaving work now?

609
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:24,831
What is it now?

610
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:27,401
When you're performing
a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,

611
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,303
you're supposed to just leave
the duodenum alone...

612
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,805
...when you connect the stomach
and jejunum, right?

613
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:36,476
That's a video of the surgery
you asked me about.

614
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,413
It has footage of a gastrectomy
and a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

615
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,281
Is this footage of surgeries that
you did yourself?

616
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,450
Why do you have so many questions?

617
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,118
Just watch the thing!

618
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:47,421
You sure are a chatterbox.

619
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:48,914
Hurry up and get better soon.

620
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:50,858
Thank you!

621
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:53,861
I'll call you "Teacher" from now on!

622
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:28,262
My child gave this to me
before she went into surgery.

623
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:31,565
She said that it was
a gift for you, Doctor.

626
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,372
To: Dr Teacher Kim.

627
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:16,310
I was quite a nuisance to you
all this time, wasn't I, Doctor?

628
00:46:16,376 --> 00:46:21,148
But thank you for taking the time to
teach me and talk to me anyway.

629
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:26,353
To be honest, I knew from the beginning
that you were Dr Bu Yong-joo.

630
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,555
Mister!

631
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:33,427
Do you know Dr Bu Yong-joo,
by any chance?

632
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:39,499
I was so nervous that I blurted
that out before I knew it.

633
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:45,372
I don't think I'll ever forget the time
I spent with you at the hospital.

634
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:49,142
Thank you for being
the head surgeon of my surgery.

635
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,980
I'll come and visit you after
the surgery is over and I'm healthy again,

636
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:58,519
while dreaming of the day that I'll be
standing in an operating room with you.

637
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,789
Your disciple, Jang Hyun-joo.

638
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,560
I see.

639
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:43,430
Do you think that girl knew...

640
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:46,066
...that the name she gave you...

641
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,535
...changed your life forever?

642
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:51,538
I don't know.

643
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:09,556
To: Dr Teacher Kim

644
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:24,004
I don't think any of his main arteries are
damaged, according to the CT scans.

645
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:26,640
It does look like his intestines are
injured, however.

646
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:30,477
So this injury won't affect his life if
he gets surgery, right?

647
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,714
Hey, Kang Dong-joo.

648
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,782
Huh?

649
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,725
We'll only know the specifics after
we go into surgery and check it out.

650
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:48,996
It could be that we can't see the vessel
that was damaged by the glass.

651
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:50,497
Oh, I see.

652
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:52,766
Let's move him to the OR first.

653
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:54,368
Yeah.

654
00:48:58,338 --> 00:48:59,606
What's wrong?

655
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:01,308
Did something happen?

656
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,576
It's nothing.

657
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:05,078
We have a patient!

658
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,881
Get him to bed number three, quickly.

659
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:10,117
What happened to him?

660
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:12,452
Chest pains that began
right when he called us.

661
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:13,487
Chest pain?

662
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:17,191
We gave him two doses of antibiotics,
but his pain didn't get any better.

663
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:18,398
How are his vitals?

664
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:19,960
BP is 160/100, with 100 bpm.

665
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:22,563
Please check his vitals
one more time, Nurse Oh.

666
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:23,530
And run an EKG test on him, please.

667
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:24,437
Understood.

668
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,005
His BP is 100/60 now.

669
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:32,973
What?

670
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:34,641
Why did his BP change so suddenly?

671
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,976
Can you take his vitals
from his right side, please?

672
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,044
Of course.

673
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,378
Weren't you in the ICU?

674
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:40,047
I'm just on my way back from there.

675
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,448
What about the EKG results?

676
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:42,816
Here you are.

677
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:47,054
It's not a STEMI.

678
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,190
His BP is 160/60 on his right side,
and 100/60 on his left side.

679
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:51,458
Really?

680
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:54,595
What kind of pain are you
experiencing in your chest, sir?

681
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:58,065
It feels like it's being torn to shreds!

682
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,001
Could it be...

683
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:05,472
-An aortic dissection?
-An aortic dissection?

684
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:07,107
Excuse me! Over here!

685
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,243
My husband will die at this rate!

686
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,345
Oh no!

687
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,513
Where does it hurt, sir?

688
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,915
He says that it's his stomach!

689
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:17,317
He was defecating blood and everything!

690
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:19,686
I'm going to die!

691
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:21,421
Oh, ow!

692
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:23,423
Geez!

693
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,094
Oh, this is the patient who refused
treatment before and discharged himself.

694
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,195
Discharged himself?

695
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,997
He was completely drunk before.

696
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:32,533
His BP is 90/60, with 130 bpm.

697
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,368
You said that he had bloody stools?

698
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:37,838
Yes, he went to the bathroom
because his stomach hurt,

699
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:39,206
and didn't come out for a long time.

700
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:43,277
And when I went in, his face was
pale and he couldn't move!

701
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:45,879
And when I stood him up,
in the toilet, there was...

702
00:50:45,946 --> 00:50:47,447
...tons of blood!

703
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:49,850
Geez, Geez!

704
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,985
How could he do this to himself?

705
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:53,487
What are we going to do now?

706
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,155
Oh, my stomach!

707
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:03,497
His wall motions are okay,

708
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,532
but I can't see his aorta root very well.

709
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:11,872
Oh, it is an aorta dissection.

710
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:12,806
It is?

711
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,775
Yes, it is. Right here.

712
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:19,146
I can't see his abdominal aorta.

713
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:21,448
It seems like a Stanford type A.

714
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,308
How are you feeling?

715
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:49,610
I feel good.

716
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:53,847
Great, even.

717
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:57,718
And I think that it's become
easier for me to breathe, too.

718
00:51:57,918 --> 00:52:00,220
But...

719
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:04,491
...when are you planning to
take all of these...

720
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:08,328
...annoying tubes off me?

721
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:11,698
You sure are impatient, Mr Chairman.

722
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:16,303
I'll get all of these things and the chest
tube out of you within two days.

723
00:52:18,906 --> 00:52:20,507
Good work.

724
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:22,276
Thanks.

725
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:25,179
No, I should be the one thanking you.

726
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:29,983
We almost got this hospital
shut down because of you.

727
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,051
What?

728
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:32,953
Really?

729
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:41,228
I guess I really am a big shot, after all!

730
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:47,000
Geez.

731
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:52,906
The ER staff are asking me to come down.

732
00:52:52,973 --> 00:52:54,842
Sure, sure. Go on now.

733
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:55,876
Yes, sir.

734
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:00,080
What's going on?

735
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:03,050
We have three patients who
need emergency surgery.

736
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:04,184
Three? Really?

737
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,854
One patient has
an abdomen-penetrating injury.

738
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,623
The glass is lodged in there
and there's internal damage,

739
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,091
but he isn't bleeding much.

740
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:14,728
I think that the patient with
the aortic dissection takes priority, sir.

741
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:16,697
We have a patient with
an aortic dissection?

742
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:17,698
What about the CT scan?

743
00:53:17,764 --> 00:53:18,966
We just got it.

744
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:22,769
It's a type A aortic dissection.

745
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:23,670
What about his BP?

746
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:25,472
Initially, it was 160/100
on his right side,

747
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,007
and 100/60 on his left side.

748
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:30,344
But it has fallen to
120/80 on his right side.

749
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:31,512
Did you do an echocardiogram?

750
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:32,412
Yes.

751
00:53:32,479 --> 00:53:33,347
Any AVR?

752
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:34,948
A bit, but it's not severe.

753
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:36,149
What about the last patient?

754
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,185
His CT scan is being uploaded right now.

755
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,387
But he has ischemic colitis.

756
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:41,755
Ischemic colitis?

757
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:44,758
The CT scan for the patient
with ischemic colitis is now up.

758
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,766
Geez, what a headache...

759
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,602
I even see pneumatosis intestinalis here.

760
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,840
Geez, we'll have to cut this out.

761
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,276
Yes, it does appear that way.

762
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:06,446
Geez, what a complicated situation.
What should we do?

763
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:11,985
We can't even transfer at least one of
them to a different hospital, either.

764
00:54:12,052 --> 00:54:12,920
Doctor.

765
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:14,054
Let's take care of
the aortic dissection first...

766
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:17,558
It'll take a bit of time to prepare for
that surgery, even if we start now.

767
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:20,527
I think we should take care of
the patient with ischemic colitis first.

768
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:23,197
But the patient with
the dissection is the most critical.

769
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,966
He's the one who came in first, too.

770
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,001
If we're going by the order
in which they came,

771
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:29,570
the abdominal patient should be first.

772
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:32,339
But the patient with the dissection
needs care the most right now!

773
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:33,340
Am I wrong?

774
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:34,708
Why are you so fixated on
the dissection patient,

775
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:36,109
when you're a general surgeon?

776
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:37,611
What's wrong with you?

777
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,106
Let me know if you need anything else.

778
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:08,442
Yes, thank you.

779
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,583
I have a question.

780
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:18,018
Yes?

781
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:24,024
Your son wreaked some havoc at
Geosan Hospital's ER 14 years ago, right?

782
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,859
Who are you?

783
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,230
Who are you that you're suddenly asking
me about something from 14 years ago?

784
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:34,535
Well, I'm trying to collect some
information about someone.

785
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,773
Here you are.

786
00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:42,976
REPORTER OH SUNG-JAE

787
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:46,847
But there are some pieces of
the puzzle that don't quite seem to fit.

788
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:50,884
I've suffered quite a bit
while going around...

789
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:52,853
...and collecting more information.

790
00:55:56,256 --> 00:56:01,028
I know that your late husband died
in the ER at Geosan University Hospital...

791
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:04,331
...within an hour of arriving there.

792
00:56:05,065 --> 00:56:09,837
That was due to an issue
with his aorta, correct?

793
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:17,744
How long will it take for us to
prepare for surgery, Yoon Seo-Jung?

794
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,514
About 30 minutes in total.

795
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:21,748
Okay.

796
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:24,952
Then maintain that dissection
patient's condition until then.

797
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:27,621
Have the colitis patient treated first,
and move him to the OR.

798
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:28,522
Yes, Doctor.

799
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:29,456
Doctor!

800
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:31,825
You're a general surgeon, Kang Dong-joo.

801
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,995
Just focus on the patient
whose fate lies in your hands.

802
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:38,966
Yoon Seo-Jung and I will take care of
the cardiothoracic patient.

803
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:46,073
Is this how you lost him last time, too?

804
00:56:52,846 --> 00:56:54,882
On that day...

805
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:59,920
...a VIP patient was prioritized
before my father,

806
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:02,990
who'd come in before him.

807
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:09,530
And I heard that the surgeon
who did that was you, Doctor.

808
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,550
There's no need to be so nervous.

809
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:34,321
What I'm curious about is the bill
for the damage that was caused then.

810
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:38,125
I heard that the damages cost
about 200,000 dollars in total.

811
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:41,628
So who helped you repay
all that back then?

812
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:48,669
Can you tell me who it was?

813
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,340
Can you tell me, Doctor?

814
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,510
Why...

815
00:57:56,577 --> 00:58:00,013
...did you push back my
father's surgery back then?

816
00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:01,748
Kang Dong-joo...

817
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,151
Please tell me the reason.

818
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:09,256
Who was it?

819
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,094
Why can't you answer me?

820
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,534
I asked you why you pushed back
my father's surgery back then.

821
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,203
Why?

822
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:03,343
Do you know what the easiest thing is?

823
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,112
Destroying relationships.

824
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,813
All you need to tell them is,

825
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,949
"You're being deceived."

826
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:10,918
Yes, I remember perfectly.

827
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:12,686
I made the decision about that surgery.

828
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:15,822
He blamed the incident from 14 years ago
on Bu Yong-joo alone and now,

829
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,492
you can't find that name anywhere.

830
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,661
What do you mean you're
going to fight the hospital?

831
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,930
Do you think you can win this fight?

832
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:24,331
Why?

833
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:25,732
Are you nervous?

834
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:34,286
