1
00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:02,695
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,721
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:26,693
Are they those who will be
participating in my surgery?

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,829
Yes, Mr Chairman.

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,799
They seem quite reliable.

6
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,069
Don't you think so, Manager Joo?

7
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,771
Yes, sir. I think so too.

8
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:44,711
I was actually just in the middle
of discussing your surgery with them.

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,747
Oh, good.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:53,086
I actually came down here
because I wanted to talk about that.

11
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,294
Look here, Teacher Kim.

12
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:01,434
Yes, sir?

13
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:07,534
Let's do as we'd originally planned.

14
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,308
Pardon?

15
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:15,475
Let's do the surgery
as we'd originally planned.

16
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,544
Mr Chairman...

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,288
We believe it's time for the foundation
to have a young chairperson now.

18
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:35,829
As such, we were considering suggesting
you to be the next chairwoman.

19
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,531
Don't say such a thing so lightly.

20
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,435
Father is still healthy.

21
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,305
I know that discussing such matters
may be uncomfortable for you.

22
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:50,043
But it's best for us to have measures
in place for what may happen...

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,113
He said that he'd have the surgery.

24
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,684
He's going to have the surgery?

25
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,719
Yes.

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,416
The chairman insists on having it done.

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,423
Did you give this a lot of thought...

28
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,973
...before coming to this decision,
Mr Chairman?

29
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,532
Of course.

30
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,769
My life is on the line here, after all.

31
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:24,011
Just because I'm old
and I've lived long enough...

32
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,981
...doesn't mean
that I've lost the will to live.

33
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:31,952
If anything,

34
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,595
I have a greater desire to live...

35
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:40,147
...because I don't have
many days left before me.

36
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,596
But...

37
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,099
...this doesn't sit well with me.

38
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:53,740
I can't just do nothing and wait
helplessly for my death to come.

39
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,678
That's not my style.

40
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,883
It's not a simple surgery in which
we'd be swapping out the batteries.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,054
We have to do a complete
artificial heart transplant, Mr Chairman.

42
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,559
This surgical procedure itself
will be quite hard on your body.

43
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,728
I know.

44
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,667
You do, and yet you insist on having it?

45
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:27,274
I want to live every day
as healthy as I can.

46
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,608
I want to live like that
before I have to die.

47
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,013
Teacher Kim.

48
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:39,052
Please respect my decision.

49
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,587
Okay?

50
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,859
What did Bu Yong-joo say?

51
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,162
Did he say that he'd do the surgery?

52
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,163
I don't know.

53
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,401
What are you going to do if he does?

54
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,637
How could any sane person
perform such a surgery?

55
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,773
He knows the chairman's condition
better than anyone else.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,208
He's Bu Yong-joo, after all.

57
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,080
He enjoys taking on near impossible
surgeries more than anyone else.

58
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,218
So isn't there a greater chance
that he'll do it than not?

59
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,892
If he does,
he'll be digging his own grave.

60
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,169
I wonder why he's acting like that.

61
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,976
You think he's deliberating on whether
or not he should do the surgery?

62
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,612
It does seem that way, doesn't it?

63
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,915
Is he considering doing it?

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,856
Or is he thinking about giving up?

65
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:49,957
I don't think it's that.

66
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,059
I don't think it's that, either.

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,093
Right?

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,630
He's not the type of person
to give up on the surgery, is he?

69
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,567
What else could he possibly
be thinking about, if not that?

70
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,973
He may be mapping out
the surgery in his mind's eye.

71
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,441
I agree.

72
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,713
Mapping out the surgery
in his mind's eye?

73
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,851
I wonder what he's planning right now...

74
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,720
...in order to make
this surgery a success.

75
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:54,288
EPISODE 16 Risk

76
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,493
Please hydrate him, and follow up
when his condition gets better.

77
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,266
And please see me, Ms Woo Yeon-hwa.

78
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,703
How could you call a surgeon
just because of something like this?

79
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,637
Pardon?

80
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,407
It's not like his symptoms are severe
and we're able to get the gas out of him.

81
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,677
An ER specialist
could've easily handled this.

82
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,779
Well, the patient said that he's had...

83
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,714
...surgery before and the x-rays showed
it could be ileus.

84
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,782
I was just unsure, so...

85
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,718
This may be a hospital with no clear line
between ER people and surgeons,

86
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,546
but isn't it irresponsible to call
a surgeon at any given opportunity?

87
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,891
Also, Ms Woo Yeon-hwa...
No, Dr Woo Yeon-hwa.

88
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,832
Didn't you say that you did a residency
as a surgeon for one year, too?

89
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,831
Then you should be able to tell if this is
a situation that requires calling me!

90
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,626
Instead of saying you're sorry,
do things right...

92
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,907
Do things right, for goodness' sake.

93
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,718
What's his problem?

94
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,020
I think he's a bit angry at me.

95
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,488
Why?

96
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,191
Because I did something wrong.

97
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,201
Geez...!

98
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,538
Ms Woo Yeon-hwa.

99
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,339
Are you ignoring my orders?

100
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,010
You're the person I told to assist
me today, not Kang Dong-joo!

101
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,612
Well, he insisted on going in there.

102
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,348
Are you saying that Kang Dong-joo's words
take priority over mine?

103
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,785
How can I trust you
and give you orders now?

104
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,987
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,088
I was thoughtless...

106
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,424
Instead of saying you're sorry,
do things right!

107
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,626
If you're going to do work,
do it properly.

108
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,074
You want us to try
and decrease the time even more?

109
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,843
Is it not possible?

110
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,580
Are you really planning to go
through with this surgery?

111
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,651
I'm thinking that it may be worth a shot.

112
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,889
Only if we can finish the surgery
within six hours, that is.

113
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,258
Six... six hours?

114
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,732
No way. What do you mean, six hours?

115
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,741
This surgery usually takes 9 to 10 hours,

116
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:24,238
and we've already shortened it
to 7 hours and 30 minutes.

117
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,442
But now you want to take another
hour and 30 minutes off that?

118
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:33,480
And that's why I'm asking you
just how much time we can take off that.

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,017
It's okay even if it's only 10 minutes...
No, 5 minutes.

120
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,286
Well? Do you think
you can shorten it somehow?

121
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,790
So you're really going to finish
the surgery in six hours?

122
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,927
Can you shorten the time or not?

123
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,562
Six hours?

124
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,197
Did you say six hours?

125
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,166
So that's what he was thinking about
all this time.

126
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,369
Finishing up the surgery
in six hours is...

127
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:56,937
Wait.

128
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,439
We need to cut through the sternum
and cannulate the vein,

129
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,242
without disturbing
any vessels or tissues.

130
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,978
And that'll still be a bit of a reach.

131
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,748
Even so, it'll be difficult
to finish within six hours.

132
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,485
And it'll be impossible to disturb
any of the vessels or the tissues.

133
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,954
Won't it be possible
if it's Teacher Kim, though?

134
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,890
It's not like cardiothoracic surgery
is his sole specialty.

135
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,760
And this will be too much to handle,
even for Teacher Kim.

136
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,328
I agree.

137
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,966
Furthermore, Teacher Kim
has nothing to gain by doing this surgery.

138
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,169
He'll be criticized
whether he succeeds or not.

139
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,539
-You think so?
-He won't just be criticized.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,176
If we fail, Teacher Kim will have to
shoulder the blame for everything alone.

141
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,545
Nah, it wouldn't be that bad.

142
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,781
Do you think Director Do
would leave Teacher Kim alone?

143
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,217
The two of them are going
head-to-head already.

144
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,987
But if Teacher Kim's surgery fails,
he'll see this as his chance...

145
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,857
...and place the blame for everything
on Teacher Kim.

146
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,326
And that's exactly why I can't fail.

147
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,130
Fail?

148
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,233
All I have to do is not fail, then.

149
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,168
Isn't that right, Kang Dong-joo?

150
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,705
The patient is a 72-year-old man
with terminal lung cancer.

151
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,076
Putting him under general anesthesia
is already a huge risk.

152
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,312
That's why I'm saying
that this surgery can't exceed six hours.

153
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,350
You know better than anyone
that six hours is impossible.

154
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,785
So, what? You can't do it?

155
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,387
It's not that I can't.

156
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,822
I'm just opposed to this.

157
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,957
Okay.

158
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,060
So we have one person opposed to this.

159
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,063
What about you, Do-il? And Nurse Oh?

160
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,666
Okay.

161
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,835
I'll take that as a "maybe."

162
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,503
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung. What about you?

163
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,538
Are you opposed to this, too?

164
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,240
No, I'm in.

165
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,408
Dr Yoon!

166
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,943
Okay!

167
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,512
So we have one "yes."

168
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,848
Okay.

169
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:53,020
Let me know when you two
make up your minds.

170
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:58,125
I do strongly hope
that you'll say yes, though.

171
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,093
Well, then.

172
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,869
Seems like he's really planning
to go through with this.

173
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,072
I'm sure that was his intention
from the start.

174
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,545
We should be talking him out of it.

175
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,448
How could you take his side
without any backup plan?

176
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,796
Because this is something
that Teacher Kim has decided on.

177
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,119
Would you die if Teacher Kim
told you to, then?

178
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,723
I told him that I'd act as if I'd died,
at the very least.

179
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,963
What is it, exactly?

180
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,232
How is it that you're able
to trust him so much?

181
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,399
Out of respect for him?

182
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,603
Respecting him is more of a reason
to think about this rationally.

183
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,974
A doctor you respect is insisting
on doing such a dangerous surgery!

184
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,609
It won't be just Teacher Kim, either.

185
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,612
Everyone at Doldam
could be in danger because of this.

186
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,631
The fact that he's acting so confident
about this...

187
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:57,632
...is because he's figured this out
to a certain point, don't you think?

188
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,888
What will you do if he really does end up
finishing in six hours?

189
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,289
It's impossible.

190
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:06,760
If anything, he might make a mistake
or fail while trying to make that time.

191
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,597
Even if you factor in mistakes, failures,
and other unpredictable factors...

192
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:16,136
...I really want to be a part
of that surgery, Dong-joo.

193
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,876
I may never have another chance
to perform a surgery like this again.

194
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,647
Heart transplant surgeries
aren't too common in the first place.

195
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:30,517
And when else will I ever get
a chance to see a surgery that...

196
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,687
...Teacher Kim is in charge of
with my own eyes?

197
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,688
Isn't that right?

198
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,191
But still,
there are too many risks involved.

199
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,161
I think that
it's a risk worth taking, though.

200
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,930
And what if you end up failing?

201
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,434
Man, I don't even want to think about it.

202
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,504
But even if I do,

203
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,908
I'll be thankful that I was
with Teacher Kim through it all.

204
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,179
I think that, in itself,
makes this meaningful.

205
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,698
Look at this little brat.

206
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,468
So, are you saying that he's going through
with the surgery?

207
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,010
Fine.

208
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,807
Send me the list of the staff
who will be assisting him.

209
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,143
Is Bu Yong-joo going to do the surgery?

210
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,347
Apparently so.

211
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,616
If this happens,

212
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,220
we'll have to make preparations
for a potential emergency situation.

213
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,322
What do you mean, "emergency situation?"

214
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,826
The chairman is 72 years old.

215
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:49,062
Furthermore, he has terminal lung cancer.

216
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:56,837
And this surgery entails having him
under general anesthesia for 8 to 9 hours.

217
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,241
That, in itself,
is a huge risk to be taking.

218
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,976
But the surgery could succeed.

219
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,812
Despite the potential success rate
of the surgery,

220
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,750
operating on the chairman
in his current health condition,

221
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,985
is quite meaningless.

222
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,157
Well, you don't need to worry too much.

223
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,594
I have a plan.

224
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:32,539
I will go to Doldam Hospital right now
and give Bu Yong-joo two options.

225
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,779
I told you to never show
your face here again.

226
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,715
Are you just straight-up ignoring
what I said?

227
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,218
Why the heck are you showing
your face here again?

228
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,687
I just received word
regarding the chairman's surgery.

229
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,754
What?

230
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,257
Are you going to try and stop it
from happening again?

231
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:54,228
How could I, when the chairman
is insistent on having it?

232
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,831
So if you're going to do it anyway,

233
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,100
I thought I'd provide a little support.

234
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,102
Your aid?

235
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,807
I'll start by swapping out all the staff
you've prepared for your surgery.

236
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,885
What kind of nonsense is this?

237
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm telling you this now,

238
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,989
but these aren't my orders.

239
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,991
They're Director Shin's demands.

240
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,059
Just be aware of that.

241
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,862
What do you mean?

242
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:32,099
They're swapping the surgery staff
with people from the main hospital?

243
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,967
Do Yoon-wan came and said that himself?

244
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:34,868
Yes.

245
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,039
And it wasn't Director Do's orders,
but Chairman Shin's daughter's demand.

246
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,107
What?

247
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,275
Swapping the staff?

248
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,021
So they're replacing all of us
with people from the main hospital?

249
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:44,945
Yes.

250
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,281
Apparently, Director Do came
and said that himself.

251
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,182
Okay.

252
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,483
I'll come down.

253
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:51,752
Yes.

254
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,533
You know as well as I do that Geosan is
famous for its Cardiothoracic Department.

255
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:10,103
Do you want people with lots
of experience under their belts,

256
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,840
or do you want
young fellows assisting you?

257
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:14,808
Oh, yes.

258
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,544
I should call
an anesthesiologist over too, right?

259
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:23,083
I saw the list of your surgical staff,
and saw Dr Nam Do-il there, too.

260
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,154
Entrusting Chairman Shin's anesthesia
to someone...

261
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:30,672
...who's been sued for medical malpractice
is, well, making me uneasy.

262
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,561
And that incident wasn't merely
a medical one.

263
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,067
A person ended up dying due to that.

264
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,079
Also, I'll send you
two skilled scrub nurses.

265
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,982
I'm sure they'll be on a different level,

266
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,184
than nurses who only work
in this lousy hospital.

267
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,588
You sure are annoying.

268
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:02,990
Hey.

269
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,426
Are you going to shut up on your own
or do I need to give you a beating?

270
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:11,298
I'm doing you a huge favor right now.

271
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:17,037
Sorry, but nobody else but my own staff
is allowed in my operating room.

272
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,706
Director Shin's demand?

273
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:23,410
Yeah, okay. Yeah right, you little...

274
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,581
...go and tell her to screw herself.

275
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:32,190
None of your staff members...

276
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,243
...are qualified for this,
for various reasons.

277
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,908
So if anything goes wrong
during the surgery,

278
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,694
I don't want any gossip.

279
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,095
Hey, Director Do.

280
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,464
How about you just stay out of this?

281
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,767
Then there will be no problems,
whatsoever.

282
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,303
If you can't agree
to switch the staff members out...

283
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,307
...you'll have to accept
my other condition instead.

284
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,409
Is that okay with you?

285
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,377
Other condition?

286
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,881
What other condition?

287
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,016
Perform a live surgery.

288
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,624
Live surgery?

289
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,060
What?

290
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:17,431
You're going to do a live broadcast
of my surgery?

291
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,166
Yes, Father.

292
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,503
Whose idea was that?

293
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,571
Was it Director Do's?

294
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,808
The people who will be watching
will be the hospital executives,

295
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,412
myself, and the cardiothoracic
specialists at the main hospital.

296
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:37,351
I'll only feel at ease then to make sure
that your surgery is being done properly.

297
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,386
Please give us your consent.

298
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,491
Choose one of those two.

299
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,496
Swap out your staff,
or perform a live surgery.

300
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,412
If you choose live surgery,

301
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,902
all of the Cardiothoracic Staff
at the main hospital...

302
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,713
...will come here and watch your surgery.

303
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,139
This is ridiculous.

304
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,009
Which one will you choose?

305
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,045
Will you swap out your staff?

306
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,834
Bu Yong-joo...

307
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:14,247
...will never allow his staff
to be swapped out.

308
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,225
Or do the live surgery?

309
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,730
What will happen if he chooses to
perform the live surgery?

310
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,599
I've already told you.

311
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:29,603
He will be digging his own grave.

312
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,472
Which one will it be?

313
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,875
Will you swap out your staff?

314
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,480
Or do the live surgery?

315
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,487
What kind of piece-of-trash
human being is that?

316
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,601
How could he force you to do a live
surgery if you don't swap your staff?

317
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,528
What kind of ridiculous threat is that?
Right, Teacher Kim?

318
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,965
We can't see it as a mere threat.

319
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,301
This is such a rare case,
so if it were him,

320
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,237
he would want to release
the surgical information too.

321
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,073
But his intentions aren't pure!

322
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,445
In other words, he wants to keep
an eye on our surgery in real time!

323
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:16,950
On top of that, why did he suddenly
bring up Dr Nam's malpractice case?

324
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:17,918
Furthermore!

325
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,088
How could he call me a second-rate nurse?

326
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,923
He never said that, Nurse Oh.

327
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,558
Please calm yourself!

328
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,963
At any rate, this makes me feel
quite unsatisfied, Teacher Kim.

329
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:34,034
I think that we need to reject both
of the choices offered by Director Do.

330
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,869
My opinion differs a bit, Nurse Oh.

331
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:37,971
This could end up becoming
an opportunity for us.

332
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,506
Opportunity, whatever!

333
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,547
An opportunity to be pissed off,
you mean?

334
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,913
An opportunity to prove Teacher Kim's
skills to the world once more.

335
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,714
What do you think, Teacher Kim?

336
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,587
Well, I don't know.

337
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,122
That's...

338
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,524
How about agreeing to swap out
your staff, Teacher Kim?

339
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,998
It's best to avoid any unpleasantness
if we can, like Director Do said.

340
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,934
Even though the courts haven't made
their final verdict,

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,304
it's true that I'm being sued
for malpractice.

342
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:14,775
And if by chance something does go wrong,

343
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,379
my situation could adversely
affect you too, Teacher Kim.

344
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,981
Dr Nam!

345
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:24,484
We can't become a burden to
Teacher Kim, Nurse Oh.

346
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:30,090
Let's just focus on what we can do
to help him right now.

347
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,844
I'll try to shorten my procedure
by another five minutes.

348
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,715
Will this even be of help to you?

349
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,751
Okay!

350
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,521
So we have another person
on board with this.

351
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,956
So it's him and Yoon Seo-Jung now.

352
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,095
What about you, Do-il? And Nurse Oh?

353
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:12,165
Oh, come on.

354
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,234
You haven't decided yet?

355
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:15,302
Teacher Kim.

356
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,304
Please don't take my advice too lightly.

357
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,274
Spare me your ridiculous comments,
will you?

358
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,276
Let's just do as we always do, Do-il!

359
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,877
That's how you'll be of help to me.

360
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:24,945
But Teacher Kim...

361
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,949
There's nobody else I could trust
and entrust this task to but you.

362
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,818
If someone else besides you
comes into my operating room,

363
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,022
I'll feel so uneasy that I won't be able
to focus on the surgery.

364
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:39,560
And if that happens, there will definitely
be delays during the surgery.

365
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:45,132
I'm trying to shave off mere minutes
where I can, so I can't waste any time.

366
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,335
You too, Nurse Oh.

367
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:53,807
Why are you getting mad over
Director Do's ludicrous statements?

368
00:22:53,874 --> 00:23:00,814
The only scrub nurse in Korea
who can match my speed is you.

369
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:04,451
Geez, you know that, and yet
you let yourself get so worked up.

370
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:10,057
Well, I... that is...
that's true, yes, but...

371
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:13,594
The reason I thought that I may be
able to do this in six hours was...

372
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,600
...because I factored in the fact that
you all would be working with me.

373
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,605
Hey, Do-il.

374
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:30,010
Should I really need to spell
all of this out for you?

375
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,947
Do I really need to do that, Nurse Oh?

376
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,653
It's nice to hear such things
once in a while.

377
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:43,690
So? What will you do?

378
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,359
Do-il? Nurse Oh?

379
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,128
Will you come into my OR or not?

380
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:50,631
Well, what choice do I have?

381
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:52,466
Of course I'll go in.

382
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:56,303
I'm the only scrub nurse in Korea
who can match your speed, after all.

383
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,312
What about you, Do-il?

384
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,916
Will you really be okay with
performing a live surgery?

385
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:12,586
Geez, you're so frustrating.

386
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,158
Director Do!

387
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:21,328
Let's do the live surgery.

388
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:23,163
Happy now?

389
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,568
Happy now?

390
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,646
It's just as I'd expected.

391
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,452
Yes, Bu Yong-joo has agreed
to do the live surgery.

392
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:50,157
All that's left is to make sure
that he can never practice medicine again.

393
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:05,105
So, what date did you schedule
my surgery for?

394
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,573
Five days from now.

395
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,109
We'll begin at 9 AM.

396
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:10,777
I see.

397
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,819
I heard that my daughter
is making you do something troublesome.

398
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,655
It doesn't really matter to me.

399
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:25,158
Even if I have to do a live surgery,

400
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:29,963
shortening the duration of the surgery
is what I'm most concerned with right now.

401
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,670
That's the only thing I'm worrying about.

402
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,774
Thanks, Teacher Kim.

403
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:45,445
Save that for when
the surgery is over, Mr Chairman.

404
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,728
It looks like you were forced
to make a tough decision.

405
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,097
I'll trust you to do your best.

406
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm sure you'll do fine, though.

407
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:14,374
Is there something that the chairman
isn't telling me, by any chance?

408
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,045
Why do you think that?

409
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:23,951
Well, it seems to me
that he's hiding something.

410
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:27,788
And I was wondering if it was relevant
to the surgery somehow.

411
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:30,190
Is there anything you know about this,
Manager Joo?

412
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:36,730
I'm sorry, but he has ordered me
not to tell you anything.

413
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:41,101
So that means that
there is something, then.

414
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:45,205
Please wait for the chairman
to tell you himself, after the surgery.

415
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:04,858
Okay, we only have five days to prepare.

416
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,760
And what we have to do now
is figure out...

417
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:10,964
...how we'll shorten our time
by an hour and 30 minutes.

418
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,900
You mean an hour and 25 minutes.

419
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,537
I decreased our time by five minutes.

420
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,873
Okay, then. Yoon Seo-Jung.

421
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,774
Yes, Doctor?

422
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,576
While you do the CT scan,

423
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,345
don't forget the spots
where you'll need to do the cannulation.

424
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:26,513
Wait, no.

425
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,117
Just commit the scan to your memory,
and work from there.

426
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,151
Yes, sir.

427
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,320
Okay. Nurse Oh, and Nurse Eun-tak.

428
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,291
Please check that the positions we take,

429
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:37,691
ensure the surgery
takes as little time as possible.

430
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,126
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

431
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,194
Kang Dong-joo.

432
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,161
Yes?

433
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:46,133
You have to make sure
you can finish your part in 25 minutes.

434
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,201
Yes, sir.

435
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,669
Okay.

436
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,070
Okay, Dr Nam Do-il?

437
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:58,779
Okay, let's do our best to prepare
for the next five days, then.

438
00:27:58,846 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes, sir!

439
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:00,914
Yes, sir!

440
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:07,788
Tell all of the cardiothoracic surgeons
to be up here within 30 minutes.

441
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,489
Every single one of them!

442
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:10,958
Yes, Director.

443
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,669
You see how the main artery
is stuck to the sternum, right?

444
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,705
That space looks so narrow.

445
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,008
If you don't cut well,

446
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:31,078
you could end up cutting the heart
or damaging an artery.

447
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,250
And what will you do
if you can't cannulate the main artery?

448
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:37,584
Cannulate the femoral artery instead.

449
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:38,819
That's right.

450
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,556
And make sure you disinfect the femoral
artery when we go into surgery.

451
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:43,624
Yes, Doctor.

452
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:03,810
Chief Shin.

453
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,513
Send your best live broadcasting team
down there.

454
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,414
Yes, Director.

455
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:11,552
They'll start at 9 AM so get there
an hour before that.

456
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,619
Make sure you synchronize your schedules.

457
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:13,954
Yes, sir!

458
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,295
Please prepare a suture set.

459
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:29,596
Yes, Doctor.

460
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:36,048
You're not doing anything
right now, right?

461
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,337
Pardon?

462
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,739
You mean me?

463
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,307
Is there anyone else here?

464
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,675
No, sir.

465
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,854
If you have nothing to do, assist
me while I stitch this up.

466
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:44,912
Yes, sir.

467
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,464
You know that
subcutaneous stitches are short,

468
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,550
and surface stitches are long, right?

469
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:50,584
Yes, I do.

470
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,621
Cut.

471
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:01,228
Were you really trained as a GS?
You can't even cut properly?

472
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,362
I'm sorry.

473
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,997
I got nervous.

474
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,944
Cut.

475
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:18,879
Geez, you have to cut it shorter
than... that!

476
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,314
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,420
I told you, don't say you're sorry.
Do things right!

478
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:24,818
And wipe the blood off
if there's any bleeding!

479
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,019
It's bleeding?

480
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,288
Oh, please don't move.

481
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:32,359
It's normal for there to be a little blood
when a needle goes into skin.

482
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,927
Okay.

483
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:37,865
I'll do it.

484
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,005
Could you look after
the other patients outside, please?

485
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,707
I can take care of this.

486
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,611
Why are you just standing there?

487
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:53,146
Didn't you hear him?
Go look after the other patients.

488
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,648
Oh, yes.

489
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,564
Cut.

490
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:18,572
Hey.

491
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:21,308
What?

492
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:25,612
Did something happen
between you and Teacher Kim?

493
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:31,785
You skipping out of the conference
and Teacher Kim not looking for you.

494
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,821
Did something happen
after you and I got into a fight?

495
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,191
And you dropped off
of the team all of a sudden.

496
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,859
Nothing happened.

497
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,094
I just told him
that I didn't want to do it.

498
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,996
I told him that I wanted to drop out.

499
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:46,233
You were begging him to make you
his main assistant before.

500
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,102
So why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

501
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,204
When did I ever do that?

502
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,472
When did I ever ask him to do that?

503
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:53,974
Did Teacher Kim say that I asked him?

504
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,041
I happened to hear you ask
from outside his office.

505
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,279
So why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

506
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:00,614
I told you.

507
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,259
It's just that I don't want
to do it anymore.

508
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:03,817
It's become a huge nuisance now.

509
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:07,287
At first, I thought that we'd only have
to swap the batteries out.

510
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:09,274
But it got so complicated all of a sudden.

511
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,959
It's not like I had an important position,
anyway.

512
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:15,996
Will you come back
if you get a different position?

513
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,397
What do you mean?

514
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:20,667
We've shortened a 30-minute
procedure by 5 minutes.

515
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:24,171
But I think I'll be able to shave off
another five if we work together.

516
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:28,242
I'll take care of the battery,
and you can take care of the controller.

517
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:29,243
How about it?

518
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:32,412
Are you asking me a favor right now?

519
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,114
Why?

520
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,784
Well, I just want to shorten
the surgery time as much as I can.

521
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:43,023
Hey, when else are you going to do
another surgery like that as a GS?

522
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:47,394
It'll be a huge benefit to you to even
have your name attached to that surgery.

523
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:51,248
And it'd be even better if we succeeded
since your name will be on the surgery.

524
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:52,833
Well, how about it?

525
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,202
Won't you do it with us?

526
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,883
I'll do the battery.
You do the controller.

527
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,220
Okay.

528
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:14,655
Okay.

529
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,558
Hey, Do In-bum!

530
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,117
Can you really get that done
within 20 minutes?

531
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:47,921
In exchange, please call Do In-bum back.

532
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:52,593
If we do it together,
we can get it done in this time.

533
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,494
20 minutes, including the sutures.

534
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,696
Of course.

535
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,397
Okay. Do In-bum is in.

536
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:03,470
Yes!

537
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:18,118
I'll have what he's drinking.

538
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:24,858
I heard quite an interesting rumor.

539
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:28,262
So Dr Bu Yong-joo is making
a comeback, huh?

540
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:31,265
Yes, it somehow ended up that way.

541
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,367
Is that okay, though?

542
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:37,604
I did my best to try
and stop this from happening,

543
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:40,607
but the chairman was just too stubborn.

544
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:43,394
You said that it was an artificial
heart transplant surgery, correct?

545
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:46,980
If Bu Yong-joo succeeds in doing
such a difficult thing...

546
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:51,685
...I'm sure that you won't be able to
rest easy, Director Do.

547
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:00,037
To think that this is a world in which
such an unethical man can succeed.

548
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:02,296
How ridiculous.

549
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,035
It's so discouraging to people like us
who have worked hard for what we have.

550
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,106
We can't continue to allow
the world to work like that.

551
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,077
Reporter Oh.

552
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:23,183
Please make this world
a just place once more.

553
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,397
Where are you going?

554
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,600
Where else? Home.

555
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,268
-What about you?
-Me too.

556
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:43,036
Why? Is there a problem?

557
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:47,074
I mean, do you two have to head home
together like that?

558
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,110
I mean, we are going to the same place.
So this isn't that strange.

559
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,245
Do you live in the same neighborhood?

560
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:52,779
We live in the same house.

561
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:57,251
The same house?
You two live in the same house?

562
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,185
Yeah.

563
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,120
We live in the staff dorms together. Why?

564
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,322
Well, you should've said so, then!

565
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,757
Why didn't you tell me that?

566
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:06,126
Well, I figured that you'd definitely
be aware of that.

567
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:09,463
All of the people who came from
Seoul are living there, after all.

568
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,299
You really didn't know?

569
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:13,700
No, I didn't!

570
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,436
Hey, where did you think
I'd be staying, then?

571
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:18,572
I didn't even bother thinking
about that, punk!

572
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:22,176
And I never would've imagined
that you two are living together.

573
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:25,546
Don't go, and wait for me.

574
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:26,947
I'm coming, too.

575
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,048
Why?

576
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,416
I thought you didn't like the staff dorms?

577
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,751
You said the staff rooms here
were more like home.

578
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,986
A person can change his mind, you know.

579
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:34,621
Wait right here.

580
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,890
Don't even take a single step!

581
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,060
You're leaving now, I see.

582
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,595
Yes. Are you leaving too?

583
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:44,631
I'm a bit nervous since
the surgery is tomorrow.

584
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:47,401
I think it'd be best for me
to head home early and get some rest.

585
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:48,502
Me too.

586
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,539
Geez... What's that?

587
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,874
What's with the Bible?

588
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,311
There's a Wednesday night service today.

589
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,546
I'm planning to ask God for some...

590
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,115
...divine intervention during the
surgery tomorrow.

591
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:04,318
Since when have you been
attending church?

592
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,652
Since last Sunday.

593
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:08,288
I'm a new believer.

594
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:13,927
Oh, Dr Yoon!

595
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:16,730
Want to have something to eat at
'Come and Go' on our way home?

596
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,665
It'd be even better if we had
a refreshing glass of beer.

597
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,067
Beer?

598
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,369
It's the day before a surgery,
so I'll have to refrain.

599
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:24,505
I'll have some after the surgery is over.

600
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:28,208
But how about we have a nice bowl
of ramen with rice cakes with Dr Nam?

601
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,176
Ramen with rice cakes?

602
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,210
That sounds good, too.

603
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:33,380
Oh, there's something I forgot
about that I need to attend to.

604
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,982
Please go on ahead.

605
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,150
-Let's go, Dr Yoon.
-Yes, Nurse Oh!

606
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,922
Well, I mean, it is a cold day.

607
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,192
And I'm really craving a nice bowl
of ramen with rice cakes.

608
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:48,128
And a nice, cold beer to wash that
down... oh!

609
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,497
Huh? Where did she go?

610
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,065
Did she already leave?

611
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:56,570
Have you seen Dr Yoon by any chance,
Section Chief Jang?

612
00:38:57,304 --> 00:38:58,805
I know where she went.

613
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,279
Follow me.

614
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,049
What's going on?

615
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,895
-Cheers to Teacher Kim!
-Cheers to Teacher Kim!

616
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:59,166
-Cheers to the mechanical heart!
-Cheers to the mechanical heart!

617
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,905
Oh, I feel so bad.

618
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,608
I'm the only one who won't be
in the operating room, so...

619
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,149
Looks like you're getting blessed
by that beer instead of your god.

620
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,052
Oh, come on now.
Don't say things like that.

621
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,421
Wait, weren't you a Buddhist, though?

622
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:25,125
Wait, no. Did you convert to Catholicism?

623
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:28,428
I think the last thing
you converted to was...

624
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:30,330
Oh yeah!

625
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,199
Wasn't it that religion with the new,
powerful shaman?

626
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,334
The one that was
overflowing with sexy energy?

627
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:35,335
Hey!

628
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:38,205
Stop getting so involved in others'
religious beliefs!

629
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,706
That's my private life!
My private matters!

630
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,441
Well, whatever...

631
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:46,380
Here's your army type stew with
two orders of ramen noodles in it!

632
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,081
The ramen with rice cakes
will be out soon.

633
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:49,283
Thank you.

634
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:51,552
-Enjoy.
-Thank you!

635
00:40:56,557 --> 00:41:02,162
But, this is the first time I've heard
about Dr Nam's malpractice suit.

636
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:05,899
Is it okay if I ask what happened?

637
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,808
Later.

638
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,211
We have a huge surgery
coming up tomorrow, after all.

639
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:19,179
So let's talk about things like that
next time.

640
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,982
Oh, of course.

641
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:26,954
But you know, Dr Kang Dong-joo
and Dr Yoon Seo-Jung seem to be...

642
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,523
...more beautiful
every time I look at you two!

643
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,093
You're almost like two peas in a pod!

644
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,900
I'm only asking this on a whim.

645
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,736
Just like how some say "what if"
about ridiculous things like,

646
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:45,405
"What if Earth ends up in the
Andromeda Galaxy?"

647
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:52,513
But I'm asking this just in case,
so are you two dating?

648
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,457
Are you?

649
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,261
Oh my.

650
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,264
No, we're not.

651
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,366
We're not!

652
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,804
Really, we're not!
How did you come to think that?

653
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:24,044
We've known each other since a while
back, which is why we seem close.

654
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,813
Didn't I tell you?

655
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,349
He was an intern in my ER five years ago.

656
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,386
And I abused him like crazy.
Isn't that right, Kang Dong-joo?

657
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:39,159
Come on. I'm right, aren't I?

658
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:42,262
You were a total jackass who
acted like an untouchable intern...

659
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,430
I love you, Dr Yoon.

660
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,941
I love you, Nurse Oh.

661
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:55,943
Oh, goodness. Me?

662
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:57,978
I love you, Section Chief Jang.

663
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:03,417
I love you, Dr Nam!

664
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,622
Oh geez...

665
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:11,358
Isn't that what it's like among all of us?

666
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,695
We all love and care for one another.

667
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,464
A love thicker than water!
Our Doldam family!

668
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:18,665
You know.

669
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,502
Isn't that right, Dr Yoon?

670
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,973
Hey, Dr Nam! Our ramen with rice cakes!

671
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,574
Oh, sure.

672
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:29,409
Oh yeah. Kimchi, Kimchi...

673
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,178
I think I'll need another glass of beer.

674
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:33,914
I don't know why,
but I'm feeling quite thirsty.

675
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:36,717
I love you!

676
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:39,686
What are you doing?

677
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,688
Wasn't that a real heart-stopper?

678
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:42,823
Don't worry.

679
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,358
You still have parts two and three
to look forward to.

680
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:45,459
And onward.

681
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,038
Do you want to go outside and die,
or get beaten up by me and die?

682
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,898
Well, it'd be a bit cold
to go outside and die.

683
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:54,902
But it'll hurt to be beaten to death.

684
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,906
I love you.

685
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:01,441
Please don't...

686
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,310
Those two are definitely dating.

687
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:04,745
They definitely are.

688
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,446
I'm certain of it.

689
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:09,750
I love you.

690
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,086
Je t'aime.

691
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,436
What are you doing here?

692
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,674
I was waiting for you.

693
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,375
Why?

694
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:39,179
I will be coming
into the operating room tomorrow.

695
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,182
So I've heard.

696
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:43,089
So what?

697
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,687
It's not because of my father this time.

698
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,557
Kang Dong-joo just asked me to help,

699
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,759
so we could shorten the surgery time.

700
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,261
That's why I'm joining in.

701
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:58,632
Please, don't misunderstand my intentions.

702
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:00,968
20 minutes.

703
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:07,875
If you fumble in the middle of the
procedure or can't finish in 20 minutes,

704
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,043
I'll chop that wrist of yours right off.

705
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:11,845
So be aware of that.

706
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:36,563
Section Chief Jang!

707
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,668
Hello, Director.

708
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:43,670
The preparations are going well, right?

709
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:44,571
Of course.

710
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:47,795
We also aren't accepting
any new patients for today,

711
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:50,310
and all of the other patients
will be moved to the ER.

712
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,378
What about the chairman?

713
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,313
He's still in his room.

714
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,749
Teacher Kim went up there
not too long ago.

715
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:09,730
The people from the main hospital
have arrived.

716
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:37,224
How are you feeling today, Mr Chairman?

717
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:39,326
Well, you know.

718
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:44,364
I feel like someone who's just
about to be operated on.

719
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,802
Don't be too nervous, Mr Chairman.

720
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,206
We'll do our very best.

721
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,474
Of course.

722
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,914
Hello, Mr Chairman!

723
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:05,686
What brings you here, Director Do?

724
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:09,823
You're having a complex surgery done,
so I couldn't not come.

725
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,460
You've sure overexerted yourself, huh?

726
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:17,364
I'll see you after the surgery,
when you're healthy.

727
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,368
Sure. I'm sure that will happen.

728
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,746
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

729
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:46,343
WE ARE NOT TAKING NEW PATIENTS TODAY
For emergencies, please go to the ER.

730
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,966
Let's get him to the operating room now.

731
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,002
Yes. Allow me to assist you, Mr Chairman.

732
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,336
Sure, let's do it.

733
00:48:56,737 --> 00:48:57,938
Mr Go?

734
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:58,872
Yes?

735
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:04,845
We'll be transferring you now.

736
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:09,183
I wish you luck.

737
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:13,954
Well...

738
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:18,892
I don't know what you mean by "luck."

739
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:21,728
Who knows what you mean by that?

740
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:32,072
Today will be a longer day than usual.

741
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,075
While I'm gone, I'll be relying on you,
Nurse Uhm.

742
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,644
-You know that, right?
-Yes. Don't worry.

743
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:41,748
All of the surgeons at Doldam will be
a part of this surgery but Dr Kang,

744
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:45,953
and Dr Do can come
as soon as they discard the battery.

745
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:49,790
So if we have an emergency,
call the OR at any time.

746
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,425
Yes, we will.

747
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:54,595
Okay, then. Let's get through today.

748
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,463
I'll leave things to you, Dr Jung.

749
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,866
No need to worry when I'm here, Nurse Oh.

750
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:02,169
Who's going to protect the ER?
Why, me, of course.

751
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,406
The chairman is on his way down.

752
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:07,674
Let's go, Nurse Oh.

753
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:08,775
Yes.

754
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:09,743
Keep up the good work.

755
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:13,113
I'm so nervous.

756
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,315
Let's do this!

757
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,617
Let's do this!

758
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:17,985
We have an emergency patient!

759
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,221
He has stomach pains.

760
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:23,123
Man, first thing in the morning?

761
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:24,591
Dr Woo Yeon-hwa.

762
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:25,993
Aren't you going to do something?

763
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,060
Yes, sir!

764
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:30,402
Aren't you going to attend
to the patient?

765
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:34,368
It's best to give the younger folks
a chance to do the first diagnosis.

766
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:36,537
You sure know how to give pretty,
little excuses.

767
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:39,173
Nobody understands my
high-minded intentions!

768
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:42,409
Yes, Honey?

769
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:43,577
Good morning!

770
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:45,179
Where does it hurt, sir?

771
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:46,613
My stomach hurts so much.

772
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,915
Oh, I see. Since when?

773
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,783
Since about two months or so ago.

774
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,151
The pain came and went.

775
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,853
After I had a drink last night,

776
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,388
my stomach has been hurting a lot
since his morning.

777
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:56,456
Did you vomit or have diarrhea?

778
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:59,826
I do feel nauseous, but I didn't vomit.

779
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:01,895
I'll be examining your stomach first.

780
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:11,705
There's a lot of pressure here.

781
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:15,012
And there seems to be way too much
muscle clenching at the stomach.

782
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:17,678
Maybe it's an ulcer perforation?

783
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,749
We'll give you a painkiller first,
and then take you for an x-ray.

784
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,386
One dose of pantoprazole and
one dose of tramadol, please.

785
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:27,487
Yes, of course.

786
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,324
I'll start putting you under
anesthesia now, Mr Chairman.

787
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,693
Just think of it as sleeping
comfortably, for just a bit.

788
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:35,295
The surgery will be over when
you wake up.

789
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:41,735
I am looking forward to your bests.
All of you.

790
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:49,610
Please give him 120 mg of propofol
and 40 mg of rocuronium.

791
00:51:49,676 --> 00:51:50,878
Yes, Doctor.

792
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:11,632
Have they started?

793
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:13,700
Yes, they've just put him
under anesthesia.

794
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:28,315
For those of you who may have come on
an empty stomach this early morning,

795
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:31,518
we've prepared some bread and beverages,
such as coffee and tea.

796
00:52:31,585 --> 00:52:35,622
Just raise your hand if you need anything
and I'll come to serve you myself.

797
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:38,492
Who needs bread, coffee,
tea, or any other beverage?

798
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:40,794
Understood.

799
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:50,637
I heard that your son is partaking
in this surgery as well, sir.

800
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,573
I'm sure he's doing basic tasks,
if anything.

801
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:54,641
It's not like he knows how to do much.

802
00:52:55,542 --> 00:53:00,314
We've scheduled two hours from
the initial incision to the cannulation,

803
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,050
and the starting of the artificial
heart-lung machine.

804
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:04,918
Be on standby,

805
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:07,054
and come in immediately
when I call for you two, got it?

806
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,188
Yes, sir.

807
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:28,809
Oh, it really is Bu Yong-joo!

808
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:31,778
Wow, it's been over 10 years
since I've seen him!

809
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:34,715
I think he's been at Doldam
ever since that incident.

810
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:36,575
It looks like he's getting started now.

811
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,664
So you've finally appeared,
Dr Bu Yong-joo?

812
00:53:55,836 --> 00:53:57,538
We'll be starting the timer momentarily.

813
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:01,308
This is Mr Shin Myung-ho,
a 72-year-old man.

814
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:05,479
We will now start cutting through the
middle of his sternum

815
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,514
to perform an artificial heart
transplant surgery.

816
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:11,818
I am Teacher Kim, the doctor in
charge of this operation.

817
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:15,222
And my main assistant is
Ms Yoon Seo-Jung.

818
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,959
My scrub nurses are Ms Oh Myung-shim
and Mr Park Eun-tak.

819
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:20,794
Mr Nam Do-il is my anesthesiologist.

820
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:23,497
And Mr Park Jong-chul is my perfusionist.

821
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,465
All of you are ready, correct?

822
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:28,902
Let's do our best.

823
00:54:30,337 --> 00:54:31,471
Scalpel!

824
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:33,407
Gauze.

825
00:54:58,432 --> 00:54:59,633
Wire twister.

826
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:07,508
They sure did wind it up tight.

827
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:14,648
Wire needle holder.

828
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:20,053
The saw, please.

829
00:55:29,563 --> 00:55:32,332
-Give me the wire needle holder again.
-Here you are.

830
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,206
-Next.
-Retractor.

831
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:59,092
The site is worse than I'd imagined.

832
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:14,875
Clamp.

833
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:16,610
Hold it tight.

834
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:30,724
I'm sure it'll be difficult to tell due to
the state of the site,

835
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,426
but this right here is the artery.

836
00:56:33,293 --> 00:56:35,462
It looks weak, so be careful
when pulling on it.

837
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:36,430
Yes, Doctor.

838
00:56:58,252 --> 00:56:59,086
Teacher Kim.

839
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:01,033
His systolic blood pressure
is falling to 60,

840
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:02,956
and his oximeter reading
is falling under 40.

841
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:04,658
I'll increase the volume
and give him a transfusion.

842
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:05,592
Okay.

843
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:06,760
Oh, I'm sorry!

844
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,495
I'm so sorry, Doctor!

845
00:57:08,562 --> 00:57:10,797
It's okay. Don't freak out.

846
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:12,165
I'm so sorry!

847
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,668
Yoon Seo-Jung.

848
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,338
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung! Look at me!

849
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,376
It's okay.

850
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:26,613
We still have a lot of time.
Don't freak out.

851
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:31,185
If we're going to finish that part within
three hours, we need to cut through...

852
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:35,756
...the sternum and cannulate him without
disturbing any vessels or tissues.

853
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,392
It'll still be a bit of a reach,
even then.

854
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,428
Yoon Seo-Jung.

855
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:43,030
Focus, okay?

856
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:46,133
Focus.

857
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,035
Yes, Doctor.

858
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,505
Suture number four.

859
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,459
Wow, he's as skilled as ever.

860
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:17,531
Or... not?

861
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:19,967
Oh, geez.

862
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:24,505
Cut.

863
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:25,539
Cut.

864
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:28,141
How many more minutes did it take?

865
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,178
At least 10 to 15 minutes.

866
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:34,882
Doctor!

867
00:58:34,948 --> 00:58:38,085
We have an emergency patient.
You'll need to come with me.

868
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,388
I think it may be an ulcer perforation.

869
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:42,656
An ulcer perforation?

870
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:46,493
Hey, shouldn't he be going into
surgery right away, then?

871
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:50,230
Suction, please.

872
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,934
Six hours.

873
00:58:55,736 --> 00:58:59,373
Finish this surgery within six hours.

874
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,020
How much time do we have
until we need to go in?

875
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:05,212
About an hour to an hour and 20 minutes.

876
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:09,650
Do you think we can take care of
an ulcer perforation in an hour?

877
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,321
No matter what happens.

878
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:49,923
Within six hours.

879
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,006
We have an hour and 20 minutes.

880
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,175
Can't you take care of
an ulcer perforation by then?

881
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:09,276
The two of us.

882
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,412
He'll definitely make a mistake in order
to shorten the time of the surgery.

883
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:13,347
I'll be going into surgery now.

884
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:14,781
Don't let Teacher Kim know.

885
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:16,350
I am sorry for Bu Yong-joo,

886
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,752
but it seems that the heavens
are still on my side.

887
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:20,821
What do you mean
the chairman is still unconscious?

888
01:00:20,888 --> 01:00:21,889
Do you know what time it is?

889
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,224
People want the truth.

890
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,161
If you know the truth, do you have
the courage to tell the world?

891
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:37,115
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
