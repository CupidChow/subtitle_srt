1
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:02,686
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim.

2
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,282
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,962
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable...

4
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,999
Are you awake?

5
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:11,305
You fractured your right ankle,
so I put a cast on it.

6
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,340
It'll be good as new in two to three months.

7
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:19,146
The problem is with your wrist.

8
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,850
The fracture on your right palm
is quite severe.

9
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,753
I did put some pins in there via surgery...

10
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,225
...but you won't be able to make
more than a 70 percent recovery.

11
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,197
Is the angulation bad?

12
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:41,134
Are you working in a medical field?

13
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,204
I was a fourth-year resident
working at an ER.

14
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:49,676
Your recovery may vary...

15
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:55,015
...but in the worst case scenario,
you won't be able to go back to work.

16
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,640
That'll be 3 dollars.

17
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,607
Here you are.

18
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,576
Thank you.

19
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,881
Two orders of dumplings here, please.

20
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,794
Why don't you go home
and eat rice instead?

21
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,264
I came here
because I was craving dumplings.

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,600
Don't they even feed you
at that hospital?

23
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,869
How is it that you look so skinny?

24
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,038
I'm eating properly.

25
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,874
It's just that my schedule is unconventional
since I work at the ER.

26
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,078
So why did you insist on being a doctor?

27
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,481
It's not like your late father will come
back to life because you do that.

28
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,652
And you had to go to the hospital
your father died at, of all places.

29
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,658
I know you're my son and all,
but you sure are strange.

30
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,666
Just live your life the way you want to.

31
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,559
Meet up with your friends and date women.

32
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,006
You got that?

33
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,476
Sheesh.

34
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:35,282
OCTOBER 2016

35
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,751
These two doctors will be joining
our hospital's surgical department.

36
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,488
Kang Dong-joo and Do In-bum.

37
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,724
Dr Kang, in particular, got the highest...

38
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,506
...score on the surgical specialization exam
in the entire country.

39
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,666
I have high expectations for both of you.

40
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,130
Good luck!

41
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:55,246
Thank you!

42
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:57,004
I'll do my best!

43
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,409
I'll do my best.

44
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,677
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

45
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,345
I'll do my best.

46
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,813
Yes, let's do our best.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,814
I'll do my best.

48
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,083
I'll do my best.

49
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,653
I'll do my best.

50
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:13,987
This is my son.

51
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,455
Wow!

52
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,750
Wow, I guess talent runs in the family!

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,735
-Take good care of him.
-Yes, sir!

54
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:32,118
An Age of Discrimination.

55
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,778
This is my son, whom I mentioned before.

56
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,148
Let's talk about him on the way.

57
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,361
An age in which your family ties dictate...

58
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,786
...your place in the world
more than your skills.

59
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,688
Even in a hospital, where people are...

60
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,158
...supposed to value human lives
and help others overcome struggles.

61
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:55,963
There is a caste system in society
even in the 21st century.

62
00:04:56,146 --> 00:05:00,400
There are only two ways
to turn this situation around.

63
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,769
whether be reborn
as the hospital director's son.

64
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,072
Or save some super-level VIP
from the brink of death.

65
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,274
There's no way they'd assign a VIP
as my patient.

66
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,642
That's right.

67
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,177
They never will.

68
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,113
That's why we can't break
that vicious circle.

69
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,581
I'll be going.

70
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,183
I have a surgery in 30 minutes.

71
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,451
Again?

72
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,121
Hey, aren't you overworking yourself?

73
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,359
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

74
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,142
The hospital director is looking for you.
Go to his office.

75
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,071
Do Yun Wan

76
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,631
We just scheduled an emergency
surgery for a VIP.

77
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,501
It's Assemblyman Go Man-suk,
the former Speaker of the National Assembly.

78
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:39,072
I'm sorry, but I already have an operation
scheduled for today, sir.

79
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,608
Hey, you don't understand anything
at all!

80
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,278
You should take care of rearranging
your own schedule!

81
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,648
Don't you know what it means to have
a VIP patient entrusted to you?

82
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,083
He must be a really bad case then.

83
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,722
And you probably need someone to take
the fall if the surgery goes awry.

84
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,292
And I seemed to be the easiest person
to take advantage of among everyone.

85
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,727
Am I wrong?

86
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,296
Listen, Dr Kang Dong-joo!

87
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,798
I'm going to operate
on my original patient first.

88
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:09,169
He's a sepsis patient so he could be
in danger if we push back the operation.

89
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,170
Goodbye then.

90
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,471
Hey!

91
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,207
Why did you become a doctor?

92
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:20,180
The fact that you studied like crazy...

93
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:24,518
...means that you wanted to be successful.

94
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,321
So you should take the opportunities
offered to you.

95
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:35,028
You're the one who came to the ER once
and went on a rampage, right?

96
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,399
Yeah.

97
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,236
This patient is quite a difficult case,
just as you said.

98
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,705
He had a HCC rupture...

99
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,175
...so there's only a 30 percent chance
that your surgery will be successful.

100
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:53,146
But you need to take on that much risk
if you want to grab this opportunity.

101
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,577
You're not standing here, wanting to...

102
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:01,522
...face off against me without even
risking that little, are you?

103
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,292
Right?

104
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:14,191
If you really want to get revenge,
become a better person than them.

105
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,877
What do you mean push back the surgery?

106
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,648
Is there a problem with my father,
by any chance?

107
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,818
I have to prove myself
through my skills, no matter what.

108
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,621
I'll monitor his progress
for a few more days...

109
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,124
...before rescheduling his surgery again.

110
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,726
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:41,895
Doctor!

112
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,667
My father is okay, right?

113
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:50,704
Yes, he will be.

114
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:04,418
I'll definitely prove that I am
a better person than those people.

115
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,896
Dr Oh, I'll be cutting him open now.

116
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:17,931
His BP will drop as soon as I do.

117
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,366
Scalpel.

118
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,071
Respirator.

119
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:28,308
Scalpel.

120
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:31,845
Suction.

121
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,948
Retractor!

122
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,221
Do the suction properly!

123
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,066
Pad! Hurry!

124
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,058
Apply pressure here for now.

125
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,961
We're doing the left hemi-hepatectomy now.
Focus.

126
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,973
Is the patient okay, Dr Oh?

127
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,432
His heartbeat is getting faster,
but he's still okay for now.

128
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,430
Suction! Suction!

129
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,207
I can't see where this blood
is coming from!

130
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,108
Scalpel!

131
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:05,379
His vitals aren't looking good, Doctor.
His BP is 70/30 and falling quickly!

132
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,316
Suture.

133
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:16,323
Cut.

134
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,125
Respirator!

135
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:21,895
Do it properly! I can't get a clear look!

136
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,299
It looks like he has disseminated
intravascular coagulation too, now.

137
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,601
It'll just get worse every time he tries
to stop the blooding.

138
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,704
Success rate of 30 percent?

139
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,673
Nonsense.

140
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,943
After opening him up it was clear
that it was less than 5 percent.

141
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:40,881
I did my best, but... I failed.

142
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,151
Hurry up and get the defibrillator!

143
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,988
200 joules!

144
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,189
Ready, sir.

145
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,524
Move!

146
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,292
Go!

147
00:09:58,365 --> 00:09:59,867
Again! 200 joules!

148
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,603
Move! Go!

149
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,477
Doctor.

150
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,896
Time of passing: 5:25 PM.

151
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,847
The patient died due to excessive bleeding
during surgery.

152
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:01,728
Go Man-suk, the former Speaker of the
National Assembly passed away yesterday.

153
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,430
Go here for the time being.

154
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:10,404
TRANSFER NOTICE TO: DOLDAM HOSPITAL
GANGWONDO, JUNGSUN GENERAL SURGERY

155
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,137
Doldam Hospital?

156
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,007
Where is this place?

157
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,276
It's our sister hospital
located in Jungsun.

158
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,413
I'll call you back here
when all of this blows over,

159
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,482
so don't do anything stupid
and just relax there for a bit.

160
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,384
Think of it as getting some rest.

161
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,520
Understood?

162
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,561
So in other words, I got screwed over.

163
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,310
Whoa, what is this place?

164
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,753
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

165
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,978
MOTHER

166
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,866
What are you staring at?

167
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,503
I thought we had a visitor,
but it looks like he's leaving.

168
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,673
Maybe he made a wrong turn?

169
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,013
Darn it.

170
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:19,666
Dong-joo, did you get to Jungsan safely?

171
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,870
I'm sure you're busy trying to get used
to this new place and all...

172
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:01,241
...but call me as soon as
you get less busy, okay?

173
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,010
I'm curious to hear about everything.

174
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,014
Make sure you don't skip meals
and get three square meals per day!

175
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,515
Okay?

176
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:25,499
TRANSFER NOTICE TO: DOLDAM HOSPITAL
GANGWONDO, JUNGSUN GENERAL SURGERY

177
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:38,925
Letter of Resignation

178
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:07,407
Excuse me, can I get more pickles,
please?

179
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,138
I, Surgeon Kang Dong-joo,

180
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,723
from this day onward...

181
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:48,321
...hereby forfeit my position...

182
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,918
Hey! Wake up! Hey!

183
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,627
Call 911! Hurry!

184
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,229
Excuse me!

185
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:03,855
-Do you work here?
-Yes.

186
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,183
You don't have an automated
external defibrillator here?

187
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,937
Yes, we do. I'll bring it now.

188
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:26,954
Here you are.

189
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,522
-Do you know how to use it?
-No.

190
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,858
I did receive training,
but I don't remember.

191
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,044
Keep applying pressure right here.

192
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:34,977
-Use two hands and press hard.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,136
What are you doing?

194
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,906
Can't you see that I'm in the middle
of treating someone urgently?

195
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,512
Are you out of your mind? Move your foot!

196
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,647
What are you doing
when someone is dying here?

197
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:56,116
Are you trying to kill this person?

198
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,784
-Hey.
-Yes?

199
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,220
Stop doing that and set him upright.

200
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,923
Don't stop and keep going!

201
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,892
Didn't you hear me?
Stop doing that and set him upright!

202
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:09,930
I'm a doctor
at Geosan University Hospital.

203
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,233
Don't stop. He'll die if you do!

204
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,203
If you want to play doctor,
don't get plastered.

205
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,672
Or if you got drunk,
don't offer your help.

206
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:22,643
This is why you got transferred
to a hospital in the boonies.

207
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,942
Hey.

208
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,481
Set that man upright unless you want
to clear a corpse off the floor.

209
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,815
What's wrong with you?

210
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,085
Geez, he's so annoying...

211
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:32,885
Move.

212
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,860
Will you take responsibility
if this person dies?

213
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,472
What are you going to do if I save him?

214
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,834
I'll bet my life that you definitely can't.

215
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:45,566
Okay. Deal.

216
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,768
You little punk...

217
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,706
Move.

218
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,508
-I said move!
-Yes, sir!

219
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,577
-Grab him.
-Yes, sir.

220
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,812
-And pull him up.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,684
-Stand him up straight!
-Yes, sir.

222
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,811
Here's his xiphoid process.

223
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:14,728
Pull the part below that up slowly
and steadily while applying pressure.

224
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:18,265
And then...

225
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:37,531
That's why you should chew properly
when you're eating!

226
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,387
Thank you, sir! Thank...

227
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:49,096
Oops! He lived!

228
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,736
Huh?

229
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:01,742
Let go of me!

230
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,090
What are you doing?

231
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,159
What are you doing
and in my kitchen, man?

232
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,761
Let me borrow some tools.

233
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,198
Hey guys, hold this down, okay?

234
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,137
Let go!

235
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,776
What do you need tools for?

236
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,368
This guy bet his life, but lost to me.

237
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:44,952
Hey, I think you're going a bit
overboard with your joke here.

238
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,620
Who said I was joking?

239
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,355
You have to pay up since you lost.

240
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:52,226
I will take the wrist
instead of your life...

241
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,262
Hey, come on.
Sharpen your knives will you?

242
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:56,330
Look at how dull this is!

243
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,666
I tend to depend more on my strength
than the sharpness of the knife, so...

244
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,537
That's why your knives get dull so easily.

245
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,787
You can't get a nice, clean cut
without a sharp blade.

246
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,313
Make sure that there's not too much
blood splatter, okay?

247
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,278
Do you know how annoying it was
to clean up after you last time?

248
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,074
Blood?

249
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,736
There we go. Much better.

250
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,561
You're really going to cut my hand off?

251
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:28,977
Really?

252
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:34,096
A man should stay true to his word.
That's what real men do.

253
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,770
No objections, right?

254
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,093
Who the heck are you? Are you a gangster?

255
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:43,782
Well, I'm so-called a swordsman.

256
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,482
Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry, kid.

257
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,486
It might hurt a little,
but it'll be over real soon.

258
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:58,025
Okay. I'll slice straight through
the muscles and bones.

259
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,261
I'll slice through it in one go.

260
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:07,328
Hey, what are you doing? See him out.

261
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:20,447
Please call the police.

262
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:21,515
What?

263
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:23,617
The police! Call the police!

264
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:24,952
Here you are!

265
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,767
Darn it, where are my keys?

266
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:51,211
Darn it! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

267
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,216
Go! Go! Go! Go!

268
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:07,528
Where are you headed?

269
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:11,996
Sir?

270
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,459
Where are you headed?

271
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:28,743
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

272
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,312
Excuse me.

273
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,181
We're no longer seeing patients today.

274
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,077
I'm not here for that.

275
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:05,618
Are you here to be discharged?

276
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,743
Please move over to Window Number 2.

277
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:21,247
My name is Kang Dong-joo.
I'm a surgeon from Geosan Hospital.

278
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:26,172
I was transferred and I'm supposed
to work here starting today.

279
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,178
Do you have a notice stating that
with you?

280
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:30,351
Could you show it to me?

281
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:31,453
Well, that is...

282
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,153
...something happened on the way here
and I lost it.

283
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:37,283
If you call Geosan University Hospital...

284
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,353
It's 8 PM now.

285
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,780
Nobody will be there to pick up my call.

286
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:43,239
You'll have to wait until tomorrow
so that we can confirm this.

287
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:45,313
Wait, then...

288
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:49,857
...I rushed over here, so I haven't found
a place to stay yet.

289
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:52,808
Could you help me with that,
by any chance?

290
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:58,641
I apologize, but we only offer
such amenities to our hospital's employees.

291
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,475
I can't offer you a place to stay
when we can't confirm your identity.

292
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,202
2What's going on?

293
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,947
Where... am I?

294
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:35,371
Don't worry.

295
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,305
The surgery was a success.

296
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,603
Surgery?

297
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:43,530
I got your right hand.

298
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,241
No!

299
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,022
I finished speaking
to the main hospital just now.

300
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:18,563
-What?
-Please come with me, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

301
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,252
This is the director of Doldam Hospital.

302
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:39,469
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Yeo Woon-young.

303
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,033
I'm Kang Dong-joo.

304
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:42,668
I'm a general surgeon.

305
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:44,557
Why didn't they send me
an internal medicine specialist...

306
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,793
...if they were going to send someone?

307
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,395
Excuse me?

308
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:52,944
I'm not saying that I have any particular
issues with you, Dr Kang.

309
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,320
We already have our chief
for our surgical department.

310
00:26:56,518 --> 00:27:00,373
And we do have a surgical specialist too.
I'm just saying.

311
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:03,743
Despite how we look, we're a general hospital
with all the bells and whistles.

312
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:05,845
We have an internal medicine department,
a surgical department, family physicians,

313
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,213
and even a dedicated emergency room.

314
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:13,453
You'll be shocked to see
how many patients we get!

315
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:18,891
Rembrandt, AKA Master of light,
did a couple of self-portraits.

316
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,827
He did one of himself as a young man...

317
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:22,428
...which resembled his son's
funeral portrait quite a bit...

318
00:27:22,747 --> 00:27:25,965
At any rate, we welcome you
to Doldam Hospital with open arms.

319
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,668
I'm Jang Gi-tae,
the chief of administration here.

320
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:30,269
Sure, whatever.

321
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,705
You don't need to worry about me.

322
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,208
I have no intention of staying here
too long.

323
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:38,616
I'm expecting to be here for a month,
but no longer than two months.

324
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:42,081
And if I can't go back
to Geosan University Hospital by then,

325
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:44,497
I'll look into getting hired
at a much bigger hospital in Seoul.

326
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,967
I thought it'd be best for me to tell you
this now rather than later.

327
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:51,529
I see.

328
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,459
I completely understand what you're saying.

329
00:27:57,578 --> 00:27:59,632
Does he not really like our hospital
or something?

330
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:02,502
I will bet you 50 dollars that he won't
even be able to last a week here.

331
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:05,705
He has a good look about him,
so I quite liked him.

332
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,906
Three days!

333
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:10,009
I'll bet you 100 dollars that this will
all be settled within three days!

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,211
Good morning.

335
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:16,616
And if it's not a good morning for you,
then never mind.

336
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:22,822
Dr Yoon doesn't have many days
left here, right?

337
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,222
Stop sticking your nose
into other people's business.

338
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:29,862
So, about that handsome male doctor.

339
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:31,898
Where is he now?

340
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,966
He said he wanted to get changed,

341
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,569
so I dropped him off at the staff wing.

342
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:38,671
Get changed?

343
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:45,281
Geez...

344
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,855
Oh my...

345
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:34,954
Dr Yoon...

346
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:49,490
THE LAST DAYS OF
ADRENALINE HYPERSECRETION

347
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,316
Why are you here?

348
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,390
How did you get here?

349
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:07,093
That's what I want to ask you.

350
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:14,150
Since when…have you been here?

351
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,060
I asked you first!

352
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,465
How did you get here?

353
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,997
I was assigned to start
working here yesterday.

354
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,878
-You? Assigned here?
-Yes.

355
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,115
So I'll be working here for
the time being.

356
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,141
That's what happened.

357
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,319
For how long?

358
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:32,507
How long are you staying here?

359
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:34,058
It's your turn to answer my question now.

360
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:37,356
Since when have you been here?

361
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:39,006
I asked you how long you're staying here.

362
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,229
Have you been here since that incident,
by any chance?

363
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:51,348
You've been here for five years straight
since that incident?

364
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,202
Whatever. If you don't want to answer me,
then never mind.

365
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:56,609
Why didn't you call even once?

366
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:05,751
I sent you texts and voicemails
for over a month after you left.

367
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,168
Did you even read or listen to those?

368
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,011
No.

369
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:20,760
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

370
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:39,259
Dr Park, we've got a patient. Get ready.

371
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:40,780
Yes, Nurse Oh.

372
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:54,870
Pass that to me.

373
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,459
Let's move him to the ER.

374
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:05,156
Please undo the seatbelt.

375
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:17,960
Can you hear me, Mr Patient? Mr Patient!

376
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:24,323
What the heck? This is my car!

377
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:27,009
Darn it!

378
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:39,219
Over there!

379
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:47,852
I think he's still conscious.

380
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,166
-What about his vitals?
-BP is 70/40 and heart rate is 140.

381
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,087
His lung sound is getting weaker.

382
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:56,134
-Doctor...
-It's tension pneumothorax.

383
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,644
Give him 10 liters of oxygen through a mask
and get an IV and hydrate him.

384
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,362
And get a 24 gauge on a dressing set...

385
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,180
If he crashed his car,
there could be some hemorrhaging.

386
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:09,927
-Get me a 16 gauge, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

387
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:23,453
What's wrong with your right hand?
Did you injure it?

388
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:26,599
-Please get a chest tube ready.
-Yes, ma'am.

389
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:32,875
-What are his vitals?
-BP is 80/40. Heart rate is 140.

390
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,694
I'm not sure, though,
since he's receiving fluids now.

391
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,496
What are you doing?
The patient has abdominal damage!

392
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:37,778
I thought you were a GS!

393
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,820
Why are you using formal speech with me
all of the sudden? It's weird.

394
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:42,601
You want a resident to talk informally
to you, though you're a specialist?

395
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:43,970
I'll do that, then,
if that's okay with you.

396
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:45,442
What do you mean by that?

397
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:48,670
How can you still be a resident
when you've worked at the ER for five years?

398
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:49,401
What do you mean by that?

399
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:50,952
I'm in the process of becoming
a double-certified cardiovascular surgeon.

400
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,862
Can you focus on the patient now,
Dr Kang Dong-joo?

401
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:57,650
He already has severe muscle guarding.

402
00:34:57,717 --> 00:34:59,693
This means that he has severe
internal hemorrhaging.

403
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:03,227
It'd be best for us to put a chest tube in
and move him to a bigger hospital.

404
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:05,114
There's a limit to what we can do
at this tiny hospital, after all.

405
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,646
If you need an ultrasound machine,
we have one here too.

406
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:15,412
Our hospital has pretty much everything,
despite our appearance.

407
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,715
So he does have severe internal
hemorrhaging from his spleen. Right?

408
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,557
I think the hemorrhaging
is more severe than we thought.

409
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,666
-What should we do?
-What do you mean?

410
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:48,833
We shouldn't delay any longer
and get him to a bigger hospital.

411
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,823
How far is the nearest large hospital?

412
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,111
Two hours, by car.

413
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:55,408
Or one hour and 30 minutes,
if you really floor it.

414
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:59,077
He'll probably die due to an excessive
loss of blood on his way there.

415
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,263
Let's just treat him here.

416
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,749
This isn't an injury that can be treated
at a hospital of this caliber!

417
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:03,656
Can't you tell?

418
00:36:03,723 --> 00:36:05,181
Are you sure that's not your lack
of confidence talking?

419
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:08,187
Even if I'm a doctor,
cutting open his stomach...

420
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,387
...in an under-equipped hospital like this
is pretty much attempted murder!

421
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,592
It's not that I can't. I just won't!

422
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,774
Hey, keep it down!

423
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,553
-Vitals?
-BP at 60/40. Heart rate is 128.

424
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:46,175
He currently has internal hemorrhaging
in his lower abdomen.

425
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:49,385
We don't know his identity
nor the reason for his injuries.

426
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:52,553
He drove himself here and crashed
into another car in our parking lot.

427
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,221
His car is totaled too.

428
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,875
Why are you standing around?

429
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,147
Get back to doing what you were doing.

430
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,566
Oh...Yes.

431
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,247
Perform an intubation first.

432
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:04,568
Hook him up on a ventilator...

433
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,275
...and make preparations
for performing a ligation.

434
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:09,920
You're not planning to try and stop
his hemorrhaging here, are you?

435
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:11,356
Okay, 20 mg of that.

436
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,090
They're fast.

437
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:27,317
Put a propofol continuous infusion in him
and get some some rocuronium too.

438
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,214
Yes, sir.

439
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,650
Put the ventilator on CMV mode.

440
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,177
Pass me the tube.

441
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:39,260
Hey, don't waste time.
Just use the trocar!

442
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:40,329
Pass me the trocar, please.

443
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:42,546
A trocar? They have that here?

444
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:55,380
How many cc's of blood do we have now?

445
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,822
400 cc's now, and we've still got more
coming out, sir.

446
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:59,994
Okay. My turn now.

447
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,540
Hey. Hey!

448
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,366
Move.

449
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,356
If you're not going to do it yourself,
hurry up and move out of the way.

450
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:09,500
You're going to cut open
a patient's stomach here?

451
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,312
This isn't an OR or even a hybrid room!

452
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:13,761
What if it's not sterile enough here...

453
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:16,362
Hey, Nurse Park.
Get this thing out of my face.

454
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,432
What do you mean?

455
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:21,233
"Get this thing out of my face?"
What kind of...

456
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,367
Let go of me! Let go!

457
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:26,640
-Scalpel.
-Stop that right now.

458
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,719
Are all of you people out of your mind?

459
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:31,574
2There will be lots of blood, so be ready.

460
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,107
Are you even a real doctor?

461
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:40,188
Suction.

462
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:47,999
Okay. Suction.

463
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:52,385
Okay.

464
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,371
Ah, yes. I found it.

465
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,084
He found it already?

466
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:04,210
Okay. Hemostat, please.

467
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:12,020
Hold on to this.

468
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,300
Surgical string N3.

469
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,671
Okay, focus.

470
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,284
What's with those hands of his?

471
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:22,041
What am I seeing here?

472
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:27,079
Okay. Cover it up with film for now.

473
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:28,486
Move him to the operating room.

474
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:31,493
Finish treating his splenorrhagia there,
okay?

475
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:32,951
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

476
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:38,686
Who is this man?

477
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:41,186
What, you have a problem
with my work or something?

478
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,584
That was reckless, irresponsible,
and dangerous.

479
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,560
Really?

480
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,436
Well, clearly this situation left us
with no other choice...

481
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:53,643
...since the patient's life was in danger.

482
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,074
Do you think you'll still be okay later

483
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:58,534
after you tell the patient
how he was treated just now?

484
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:02,345
Are you talking about patients' rights
that doctors are to respect?

485
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:05,811
Don't argue about things like that
with me.

486
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:09,776
I only care about one thing.
Saving the patient!

487
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,353
Saving the patient, no matter what.

488
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:18,607
And screw everything else.

489
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:30,877
Prepare 10 packs of RBC and 8 packs
of fresh frozen plasma, please.

490
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:32,824
I'll go and prepare the operating room.

491
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:52,247
Just what is this place exactly?

492
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:53,619
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

493
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:05,778
You're not heading in?

494
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:10,205
I can't. I'm forbidden to.

495
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,562
Why didn't you oppose it back there?

496
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:20,626
Cutting someone's abdomen open
in an ER is utterly ridiculous behavior.

497
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:24,115
And it was totally unsafe
for the patient to undergo that.

498
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,140
What about you?

499
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,833
You pushed back your own patient's surgery
to perform surgery on a VIP...

500
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,406
...who ended up dying
on the operating table.

501
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:37,122
You were sent here because you tried
to gain recognition but were blindsided.

502
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:41,355
Is that kind of surgery okay to perform then?

503
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,915
Do you keep in touch with Dr In-soo?

504
00:42:47,403 --> 00:42:49,188
I heard from the head of administration.

505
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:53,241
Looks like he heard pretty much
your entire history from someone they know.

506
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,206
I had no other choice.

507
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,582
If I didn't take on that risk,
I would've lost my chance.

508
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,286
What chance?

509
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,638
A chance to prove my skills.

510
00:43:07,705 --> 00:43:08,876
To whom?

511
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:11,105
Are you really asking me that,
as if you don't know?

512
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,904
The higher-ups
who were watching me obviously.

513
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:15,283
Everything there depends on connections.
Don't you know that?

514
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:19,063
People like me who have to hit the ground
running need to do anything we can.

515
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,966
We have to side with the right people
or save a VIP patient to gain recognition!

516
00:43:29,228 --> 00:43:32,521
What happened to you
in the past five years?

517
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:36,702
You've become such a coward,
full of excuses.

518
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,850
Why did you change so much?

519
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:46,354
Was it that hard to get by?

520
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,619
You said you'd be here a month,
but no longer than two months?

521
00:43:54,905 --> 00:43:57,879
Do your best, even though I'm not sure
you'll be able to last here.

522
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:21,860
I like you, Dr Yoon.

523
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,206
This is your last year as a resident, right?

524
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,577
Let's get married as soon
as your residency is over.

525
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:39,417
I'm sorry.

526
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,927
You think you can hide your feelings
just by doing that?

527
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:17,703
What? Is your heart beating fast now
that you've run into him again?

528
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:18,938
Be reasonable!

529
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:22,141
This is just an illusion.

530
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:24,130
This is just an illusion.

531
00:45:25,077 --> 00:45:26,579
This is just an illusion.

532
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,250
I want to speak to you for a second.

533
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:01,968
Hey, I'm tired, kid. Save it for later.

534
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:37,850
Madonna definitely sounds best
on a cassette player.

535
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:48,231
I told you that I wanted to speak with you.

536
00:46:50,027 --> 00:46:53,307
A patient's rights, a doctor's integrity.

537
00:46:54,006 --> 00:46:55,940
You may not care about any of that, but...

538
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:59,082
How many patients did you kill
before you ended up here?

539
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:03,336
I'm not talking about
when you were a resident.

540
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:07,663
How many patients died under your knife
after you got your specialization?

541
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,650
One person.

542
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,558
Right before I came here.

543
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:15,370
Now add 10 to that.

544
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,359
Kill that many more people
before you come mouthing off to me.

545
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:24,201
I'll hear you out then.

546
00:47:30,878 --> 00:47:32,243
Oh, yeah.

547
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:34,634
You still have my right hand
on you there, right?

548
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:39,692
Take good care of it
because I'll come for it when I need it.

549
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:48,947
I'm sorry, but I'm not staying here long.

550
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:54,883
I'm going to leave this wretched place
in a month or even sooner if I can!

551
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,726
And do you even have a place
that'll take you,

552
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,188
if not this miserable hospital?

553
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,485
I'll go back to where I came from.

554
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:09,305
Did they say that
they'd even take you back?

555
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:15,706
I didn't get sent away to a place like this
because I lack skill.

556
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:16,946
I just got really unlucky!

557
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,632
I didn't study hard, do practicals,
and perform all those dissections...

558
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:23,619
...while pulling all-nighters all the time
just so I could be stuck in a place...

559
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:26,204
...like this hospital
for the rest of my life!

560
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:27,861
Yeah, yeah.

561
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:29,872
So what's your point?

562
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:35,439
I'm going to go back there
by any means necessary.

563
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:07,616
Dr Kang Dong-joo?

564
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,715
A call for you from Seoul.

565
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,837
She says she's your mother.

566
00:49:12,656 --> 00:49:14,656
She said she kept calling your cell
but you wouldn't pick up...

567
00:49:14,723 --> 00:49:16,753
...so she decided to call the hospital.

568
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,829
Dr IN-SOO

569
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:25,890
Later.

570
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:29,807
Tell her that I'm busy,
and that I'll call her later.

571
00:49:30,705 --> 00:49:32,048
Yes, Doctor? It's me.

572
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,484
Dr Kang's mother? Yes, hello.

573
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:37,370
Dr Kang is busy right now.

574
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:40,154
Oh, really? Okay.

575
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:41,774
I'm sorry for bothering you.

576
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:51,110
What did you say?

577
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:54,308
Director Do and Director Yeo are friends?

578
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:55,615
Yeah!

579
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,208
Director Do Yoon-wan here
and Director Yeo from there..

580
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,389
...have been best friends
since medical school!

581
00:50:01,455 --> 00:50:03,697
Oh, really?

582
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:07,036
You did greet Director Yeo properly
as soon as you got there, right?

583
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:13,551
You have to make a good impression
on Director Yeo, no matter what.

584
00:50:13,618 --> 00:50:17,561
If you want to change Director Do's mind,
you have to make Director Yeo like you.

585
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:18,560
You get what I'm saying, right?

586
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:23,051
Oh, I also managed to hear this info
from someone I know.

587
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:26,538
Apparently,
Director Yeo really loves Go game.

588
00:50:26,604 --> 00:50:30,944
And also, he loves oriental orchids.

589
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:37,935
Doctor. I'm terrible at Go game
and I know nothing about plants.

590
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:39,320
Geez, you're so frustrating!

591
00:50:39,387 --> 00:50:42,001
Do you want to be stuck
at Doldam Hospital forever?

592
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:50,280
What brings you here?

593
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:52,289
Well...

594
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:02,908
It's fine. Just tell me what you need.

595
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:08,577
I was way out of line this morning
so I feel like I didn't properly greet you.

596
00:51:10,136 --> 00:51:14,789
I'd like it if you could forgive me
if I offended you in any way, Director.

597
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:23,381
No, it's fine.
You didn't really offend me.

598
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,605
Oh, really?

599
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,986
Oh, yes!

600
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,463
I did hear that you met Teacher Kim,
though.

601
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,750
Pardon? Teacher Kim?

602
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:36,223
You know, the Chief
of the Surgical Department.

603
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:40,047
Oh. Is that how people call him?

604
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:45,081
He may not make a good first impression,
but there's a lot to learn from him.

605
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:47,193
Well, I don't know about that.

606
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,652
Be polite, no matter what.

607
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:52,405
So that he gets a good impression of you!
Got that?

608
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:55,963
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

609
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:58,982
Okay, then. You can go now.

610
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,440
Yes, sir.

611
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:04,310
What is it?

612
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,018
Was there something else
you wanted to discuss too?

613
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:08,755
Well, to be honest...

614
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,012
Director!

615
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:12,744
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung is having
an epileptic seizure again!

616
00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:13,464
Again?

617
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:17,080
-Hurry and let Teacher Kim know!
-Yes, sir.

618
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:29,753
Dr Yoon.

619
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:33,990
Dr Yoon?

620
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,015
Put that down right now.

621
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:45,785
It's best to stay back.

622
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,597
Trust Nurse Oh.

623
00:52:48,178 --> 00:52:50,337
You've been doing so well up until now.

624
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:53,467
You'll be able to reenter
the surgical room in a few days too.

625
00:52:54,227 --> 00:52:55,609
I died because of you.

626
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:57,709
The voices won't stop!

627
00:52:58,451 --> 00:53:00,409
It's because you think
that you can still hear them.

628
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:03,925
You've made a full recovery now
and you're fine now.

629
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:07,424
So, here. Give that back to me.

630
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:14,284
Give me the scalpel.

631
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:19,486
Help me.

632
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:23,623
Please, help me.

633
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:27,560
I died because of you.

634
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:29,652
Dr Yoon...

635
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,063
Stay back!

636
00:53:34,073 --> 00:53:35,293
What's wrong?

637
00:53:36,231 --> 00:53:37,236
What's going on?

638
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:41,429
Why are you holding a scalpel?
That's dangerous!

639
00:53:43,627 --> 00:53:44,778
I like you, Dr Yoon.

640
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:57,345
Give it here.

641
00:54:00,686 --> 00:54:01,716
Hurry.

642
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:05,897
No!

643
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:08,853
No. No, Dr Yoon!

644
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,604
Get some gauze, now!

645
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:37,196
Good job.

646
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,016
It seems that she took too many sedatives.

647
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:10,129
Her vitals are bad too.

648
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:12,246
It seems that the blade
damaged her artery, doesn't it?

649
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:15,730
Let's hydrate her and move her
to the operating room quickly.

650
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,390
Yes, sir.

651
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,439
-Okay. Tourniquet.
-It's ready, sir.

652
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:29,345
-Set the pressure to 205.
-Yes, sir.

653
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,182
Turn the tourniquet on.

654
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,159
The wound is small but deep.

655
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:23,324
She's cut through an artery, a nerve,
and two tendons.

656
00:57:23,658 --> 00:57:25,519
No, three.
So we have to reconnect five things.

657
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:26,725
Have you ever done this before?

658
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:31,033
I asked if you've done this before.

659
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:35,438
No. I've only ever seen the procedure
done in videos.

660
00:57:35,505 --> 00:57:36,773
This is the first time
I've actually done it.

661
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,027
If you make even a single mistake
from here on out,

662
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:42,932
I'll cut your hand off
and stick it on Dr Yoon.

663
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:43,894
Got that?

664
00:57:52,154 --> 00:57:53,094
Let us begin.

665
00:57:54,997 --> 00:57:56,010
???

666
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:08,678
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

667
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,226
Why is she in a strange place like this?

668
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:16,447
What was she doing here for five years?

669
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:18,180
You're the one making things
more complicated for me.

670
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:18,965
You don't understand that?

671
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,641
Get away from that patient!

672
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:23,460
I can't entrust a patient to a person
who harmed herself.

673
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:25,291
I tried so hard for the past five years.

674
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:27,798
You have no right to be at this hospital.

675
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:29,362
Why did you come to Doldam Hospital?

676
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:31,252
Why did you have to appear
before me again?

677
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:33,229
Who are you really, Doctor?

678
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:34,885
Bu Yong-joo, he is back.

679
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:39,005
-I asked you who you really were, Doctor.
-Kim...

680
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:41,210
-You'll never come back to Geodae again.
-Sa...

681
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:42,447
You'll never practice...

682
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:43,340
Bu.

683
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:44,811
Anywhere in Korea again!

684
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:45,711
Your real identity...

685
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:48,560
You have Kang Dong-joo there, right?
Use him well.

686
00:58:48,627 --> 00:58:50,333
I'm Dr Teacher Kim.

687
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:52,924
Are you happy now?

688
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:02,649
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
