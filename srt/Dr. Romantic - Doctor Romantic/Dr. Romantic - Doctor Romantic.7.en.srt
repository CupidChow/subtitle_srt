EPISODE 7

2
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,330
What the heck is this?

3
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,120
I want you to go to Doldam Hospital
for a while.

4
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,555
Me, sir?

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,370
Form a team as soon as possible
and head down there.

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,263
Make sure that he won't perform
the Chairman Shin's surgery.

7
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,920
Hello, Doldam Hospital staff.

8
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,110
I'm Dr Song Hyun-chul, Chief of
the surgical department.

9
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,296
I've been temporarily dispatched
here, as of today.

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,472
I am looking forward to your warm
cooperation.

11
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,230
If you can, extinguish that Bu Yong-joo

12
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,169
permanently so that he'll never
appear before me again.

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,030
So that he'll have to give up on
wearing a doctor's coat forever.

14
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,008
How am I supposed to do that,
though, sir?

15
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,621
That's why I'm sending you there.

16
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,587
Find a way, no matter what it takes.

17
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,266
I'll do my best, Director.

18
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,483
What's the meaning of this, Director Do?

19
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,020
It seemed to me before that you were

20
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,860
lacking in trained medical personnel
so I sent over supporting manpower.

21
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,050
Supporting manpower, eh?

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,414
Are you sure that that's all there
is to it?

23
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,667
Why?

24
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,508
Is there a problem?

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,496
Just keep your mouth shut and sit still.

26
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,211
That would be best, Director Yeo.

27
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,630
An era of infinite competition.

28
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,849
It's devour or be devoured.
Trample or be trampled.

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,193
We're heading to Doldam Hospital
to reform it from the inside out.

30
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,810
Don't forget that the success of

31
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,873
Geosan Hospital's 50-year plan
depends on us!

32
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,251
All right, let's do this!

33
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,710
-Let's do this!
-Let's do it.

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,019
Hey, now. Let's do this!

35
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,824
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

36
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,659
My name is Ji Min-Jung.

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,630
I've worked as a deputy nurse at
Geosan University Hospital for 10 years.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,109
I'm Oh Myung-shim.

39
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,614
I've been working for 18 years

40
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,821
and I'm the head nurse at
Doldam Hospital.

41
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,156
I'll be in charge of you all if you are
to be working here from now on.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,647
No objections, I presume?

43
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,820
We're the pride of Geosan Hospital.

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,507
Don't you dare lose when it comes to

45
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,760
the power struggles we'll face at Doldam!

46
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,360
No, I'll be the one in charge of the
nurses from the main hospital.

47
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,947
I know more about our nurses than
you do, I'm sure.

48
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,750
No objections, I presume?

49
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,979
People who believe that winning
against someone

50
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,795
is a fight with his or her pride on
the line.

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,112
And the world encourages that kind
of mentality.

52
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,182
Prove it..

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,110
You've never measured up to Dong-joo

54
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,443
with your grades or skill, have you?

55
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,561
Go win against Kang Dong-joo this time.
Just once would be enough for me.

56
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:53,597
Father, I am...

57
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,873
I have no interest in a son who only
ever loses.

58
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,846
Got that?

59
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,942
The reality that one will not be

60
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,108
acknowledged unless he wins
against someone else.

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,050
The fear of being a failure

62
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,673
after losing made people
more fiercely competitive.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,011
It'd be best for you to prepare
yourself well, Dr Bu Yong-joo.

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,268
To: Dr Teacher Kim

65
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,534
You should give it a try, then.

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,480
Episode 7: The Unstable Factor

67
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,974
You really don't know?

68
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,300
Are you sure about that?

69
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,236
I told you, I really don't know!

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,375
I packed all my things and rushed
here as soon as I got the order.

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,070
And because of that, my wife was

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,833
threatening to divorce me while
my kids were standing by, crying...

73
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,110
Even my mother-in-law came in
the middle of the night, and...

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,346
But how does this make any sense?

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,910
How do you not know your reason for

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,880
coming here when a horde of you
barged in?

77
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,436
That's what I'm saying.

78
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,850
How could they just relocate me
like this, out of nowhere?

79
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,920
Is the hospital going to take
responsibility if my wife divorces me?

80
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,339
In-bum. You're here?

81
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,521
Which locker can I use?

82
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,909
Oh, how about this one?

83
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,230
I think this is a good spot.

84
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,357
What happened?

85
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,149
Why are you here, too?

86
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,050
Is it because of the surgery from
last time?

87
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,671
Is it because of that...

88
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,194
Listen...

89
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,498
Stop talking to me, acting as
if you know me.

90
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,700
Well, I was just curious, is all...

91
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,239
Stop worrying about me.
It's making me uncomfortable.

92
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,167
Hey.

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,350
Why the heck are you being so rude?

94
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,640
Did that make you uncomfortable?

95
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,780
Sorry if I made you feel that way.

96
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,095
Hey, In-bum, wait up!

97
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,581
Are you mad?

98
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,924
What the heck was that?

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,392
He was being a total ass to you.

100
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,700
And you let him live?

101
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,760
Really?

102
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,995
Was he really acting up towards
me just now?

103
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,141
Is that right?

104
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,882
What's the relationship between you two?

105
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,255
Are you really not going to tell me?

106
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,508
He and I have a similar relationship
to the one that you and I have.

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,050
I'm a senior to him, just like
I am to you.

108
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,990
How could you possibly put me
on the same level as him?

109
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,373
Our relationship is a lot deeper
than just that!

110
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,656
What kind of relationship do we
have then, exactly?

111
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,333
I mean... we have a relationship
that's a bit more... special.

112
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,965
Special, huh?

113
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,916
Is it not, then?

114
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,855
What is it?

115
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,348
What?

116
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,294
Nothing, really.

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,967
You're just acting a bit cute, is all.

118
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,622
How could you call a grown man "cute"?

119
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,390
It's not like I'm a child, you know!

120
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,795
You are, though. Didn't you know that?

121
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,430
I am?

122
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,468
Yeah.

123
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,108
Considering childish things you do...

124
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,630
Were you really not aware of this?

125
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,028
-Senior.
-Let's get to work now, okay?

126
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,835
Hey, you know...

127
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,349
I don't know why I make you feel
so uncomfortable.

128
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,570
But let's get along, since we're
going to be working together.

129
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,443
Feel free to ask me whatever
questions you may have.

130
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,670
Okay?

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,543
Also, I know a really good...

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,095
restaurant around here.

133
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,320
If you're not interested, though,
never mind.

134
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,488
Wow.

135
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,369
When was that cabinet made?

136
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,250
Well, vintage things are all
the rage lately!

137
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,735
I apologize.

138
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,284
We've always been a bit short
on funds around here.

139
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,917
I can get you a new cabinet right
away, if you'd like.

140
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,435
Never mind.

141
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,310
I won't be here too long, anyway.

142
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,537
Pardon?

143
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,883
Oh, yes.

144
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,262
Here.

145
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,882
Congratulations on your "promotion,"
Section Chief Jang.

146
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,818
Section Chief?

147
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,820
Name: Jang Ki-tae New position:
Section Chief

148
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,420
It was Director Do's special order
that you handle the administrative

149
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,575
aspects at Doldam Hospital well,
as Section Chief.

150
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,275
Good luck.

151
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,400
Just leave everything to me, sir.

152
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,365
I'm prepared to sacrifice anything
for the sake of Doldam Hospital, sir!

153
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,200
Speaking of which...

154
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,434
Yes, Chief Song?

155
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,466
I'd like to know a lot more about
Doldam Hospital.

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,580
Pardon?

157
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,240
You know, the hidden secrets of this

158
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,839
place, perhaps or something secretly
happening around these parts.

159
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,908
Oh.

160
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,350
I feel like that man called Teacher Kim
is quite an important figure here.

161
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,462
Do you have any dirt on him,
by any chance?

162
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,962
Dirt, you say?

163
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,760
Me?

164
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,917
Are you talking about me?

165
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,301
Yes, you, Doctor.

166
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,970
What are you in charge of at this
hospital, Doctor?

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,798
Well, you see...

168
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,186
I'm...

169
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,321
-Helper.
-Helper!

170
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,791
You're just a helper.

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,295
I'm board-certified in emergency
medicine.

172
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,422
Soon to be double board-certified
in cardiothoracic surgery.

173
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,509
Looks like you're a hidden gem
among the others at this hospital.

174
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,330
Oh, no...
I'm just trying my best, is all...

175
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,796
All right, then.

176
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,746
I'll keep that in mind as
I continue working here.

177
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,132
I don't care what it may be.

178
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,810
As long as it's something that could
send Teacher Kim packing in one shot.

179
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,518
Share with me.

180
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,810
In one shot, you say?

181
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,680
I was thinking of recommending you

182
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,590
to work at the main hospital if this
all works out.

183
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,950
Think about this carefully.

184
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,950
You have plenty of time, after all.

185
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,193
Are you just going to sit and watch
those people act like this?

186
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,237
Just let them be.

187
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,640
It's clear why all of them came
down here, though!

188
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,810
Let's just leave them.

189
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,080
They're here to support us, after all.

190
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,418
Are you going to let yourself get
backstabbed again, like this?

191
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,624
This doesn't only involve you this
time around.

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,850
All of Doldam Hospital can suffer
because of this!

193
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,395
I know that!

194
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,575
Geez, why the sudden outburst?

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,788
Are you sure that you're really
aware of this?

196
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,403
Yes, I am!

197
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,512
So just leave them alone.

198
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,043
You're fully aware of the fact that
no other hospital will take you in...

199
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,662
besides ours, right?

200
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,520
Oh, where are you taking that?

201
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,138
We got some new equipment,
so I'm putting it in storage.

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,660
But, who's this?

203
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,130
She'll be helping us out around
the hospital for a while.

204
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,053
Her name is Ms Woo Yeon-hwa.

205
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,576
Nice meeting you.

206
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,540
Oh, yes, nice to meet you.
I'm Yoon Seo-Jung.

207
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,170
So, where's the new machine?

208
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,070
In the hybrid room.

209
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,627
All right, then!

210
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,124
She's my second favorite person
here, after Nurse Oh.

211
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,253
Oh, I see.

212
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,699
Wow, nice to meet you,
Ultrasound Machine!

213
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,530
Is this place still stuck in the
Stone Age, or something?

214
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,840
That ultrasound machine I just saw
belongs in a museum, not a hospital!

215
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,000
A portable chest x-ray machine?

216
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,270
You're here too, Honey?

217
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,510
Wow, it sure has been a while since
I've seen one of these!

218
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,010
I'm so happy to see you!
Man, I'm so happy!

219
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,840
The fact that you people have saved
someone's life here is a miracle.

220
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,680
And what's this, here?

221
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,211
An external cooling device.

222
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,680
It's super popular nowadays as a
hypothermia treatment device.

223
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,360
This became really popular after the
chairman of a conglomerate used it.

224
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,930
Oh! Hello, there!
I've never met this buddy.

225
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm happy to see you, too!

226
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,484
Hey, let me ask you something.

227
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,330
Why did you stay cooped up at a
hospital like this for five whole years?

228
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,900
For the views, the fresh air, and water.

229
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,000
Hey, come on!

230
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,610
Also, because of Teacher Kim.

231
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,540
Have you heard of him?

232
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,840
The legendary surgeon?

233
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,610
Yeah, he was quite a legend for
some time.

234
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,040
He's still a legend now, okay?

235
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,950
It'll be a bit tough, but your life will
change too if you can just withstand it.

236
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,350
No. I don't want to change.

237
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,120
My life is already tumultuous enough
because of the fact that I'm here.

238
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,690
I'm practically stewing in chaos
right now!

239
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,680
I have no intention of bearing this
any longer than I have to.

240
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,833
Where should I put the ECMO?

241
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,657
ECMO? We got an ECMO, too?

242
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,944
Wow, I can't believe it!
Wow, it's so pretty!

243
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,830
Geez, look at you, dancing and prancing.

244
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,020
Why are you so happy?

245
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,350
Why wouldn't I be?

246
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,993
Yes, this is Teacher Kim.

247
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,648
Well?

248
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,602
Did the equipment get to you safely?

249
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,350
Yes, it did.

250
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,002
This is the limit of my patience.

251
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,608
If you act up again,
I won't be as amused.

252
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,536
Well?

253
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,017
What date will you schedule the
surgery for?

254
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,538
I'll give you a call as soon as
we've made preparations.

255
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,710
Hurry it up, will you?

256
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,996
And you'd better call, okay?

257
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,695
This jerk thinks way too lightly of me.

258
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,844
But that's why you like him, sir.

259
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,742
It's jujube tea, sir.

260
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,384
Jujube tea?

261
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,864
He's killed someone before.

262
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,764
And it was one of his disciples
who almost worshiped him.

263
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,492
In other words, he's a psychopath!

264
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,510
I'm quite handy with a knife.

265
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,735
Are you really a real doctor?

266
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,958
How many people have you killed before?

267
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,638
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital.

268
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,615
Yes. Yes, I understand.

269
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:18,944
We have a CPR patient arriving
in three minutes!

270
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,326
Teacher Kim!

271
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,210
What happened here?

272
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,110
He's a patient with stab wounds.

273
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,884
He passed out in front of my
restaurant so I brought him here.

274
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,090
Hey, Do-il. Are you okay, though?

275
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,826
Oh, his blood is just on me
since I carried him. I'm fine.

276
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,728
Yoon Seo-Jung.

277
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,390
-Use the scissors.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,405
I think we should call the cops first.

279
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,540
What are his vitals?

280
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,010
BP is 100/70, and his heart rate
is 130 bpm.

281
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,379
Put two lines in him, and pump him
with two liters of saline.

282
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,750
The three wounds on his right side

283
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,950
aren't too deep but the two punctures
on his left side are quite deep.

284
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,548
Check him for a hemoperitoneum
with the ultrasound machine.

285
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,668
We just got this in today.

286
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,790
Doctor, his oxygen saturation
level is at 88 %.

287
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,751
Hey, Geosan fellow. Intubate this man.

288
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,950
You mean me, sir?

289
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,138
Yes, of course!

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,100
Hey, hurry up!

291
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,637
Yes, sir!

292
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,496
All done, sir.

293
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,690
His BP is 80/40, sir.

294
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,050
Okay. Keep an eye on his pulse,
and give him two packs of RBC.

295
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,135
Prepare the rapid infusion system.

296
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,399
Ready, sir.

297
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,800
We also have a new portable
chest x-ray machine, sir.

298
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,440
-Shall we use it?
-No, do the ultrasound first.

299
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,470
And just to be sure, we'll take him
to get a CT once his BP is over 100.

300
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,664
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,510
We have a patient who needs
a chest x-ray done here!

302
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,760
Yes, ma'am!

303
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,450
It's an emergency patient!

304
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,320
Let's move him. One, two, three!

305
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,740
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung.
Treat his wounds first.

306
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,900
And then get his biographical details. .

307
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,940
Also, call the general surgeons.

308
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,140
-Both Kang Dong-joo and the new guy.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,780
-Hey, Geosan fellow!
-Yes, sir?

310
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,280
-Both of you, come with me.
-Yes, sir.

311
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,780
Get me some saline and dressing

312
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,380
-for treating the wound, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

313
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,650
And try to find the patient's wallet
and phone on him, if you can.

314
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,610
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,050
Can someone call the general
surgeons, please!

316
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,676
Both Kang Dong-joo and Do In-bum!

317
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:48,640
Me!

318
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,134
I'll go get them!

319
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,630
Wow, she sure is quick on the uptake.

320
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,171
Yes, and she has a great personality, too.

321
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,300
-Oh, you surprised me.
-I'm sorry!

322
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,708
It's because of an emergency patient!

323
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,263
An emergency patient?

324
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,451
Oh, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

325
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,790
This hospital is a lot more run down
than I'd thought.

326
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,420
How is anyone going to manage to

327
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,223
perform a decent surgery on
Chairman Shin here?

328
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,704
Well?

329
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,750
Have you made up your mind?

330
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,789
Which side have you chosen?
Is it me, or Bu Yong-joo?

331
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,778
Huh?

332
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,541
Oh!

333
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,527
Oh, Dr Do In-bum!

334
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,616
Did you manage to unpack everything?

335
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,758
And what about your office?
Is it decent enough?

336
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,180
Well, more or less.

337
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,328
Right?

338
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,430
It's just so-so, isn't it?

339
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,438
But what can we do?

340
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,876
We've been dispatched out here,
so we have to do what we must.

341
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,976
Let's all work hard, yeah?

342
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,745
I'll talk to you again later.

343
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,221
Are you kissing ass here, too?

344
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,557
And what about you?
Why are you even here?

345
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,899
Let's say I'm here because I don't
have any connections.

346
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,671
But as for you, your dad is the
Director, for crying out loud.

347
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,110
So why were you exiled to
a place like this?

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,595
I wasn't "exiled."

349
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,050
I'm just getting some real-life
experience under my belt.

350
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,664
I can go back to the main hospital
whenever I want to, after all.

351
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,275
Even though I can't say the same for you.

352
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,683
What is it that you have over me,

353
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,766
besides your father and his connections?

354
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,605
If there's even a single thing at
which you're better than me, name it.

355
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,790
Prove it.

356
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,646
Just once is enough.

357
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,293
Go and win against Kang Dong-joo.

358
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,150
That little brat...

359
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,960
At least I'm merely repulsive.
You're irrelevant.

360
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,449
What, are you going to hit me?

361
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,975
You're not even worth hitting.

362
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,116
Why would I hurt my hand for the
likes of you?

363
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,974
Why would that matter, when your
surgical skills suck?

364
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,918
Excuse me!

365
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,818
You're needed in the ER.

366
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,444
Oh, your lip! It's bleeding!

367
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,395
Um, you're a general surgeon too, right?

368
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,872
Teacher Kim asked for you, too.

369
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,894
It's a vfib. Compression.

370
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,309
Charge it up. 200 joules.

371
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,210
Ready, sir.

372
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,229
Step back.

373
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,140
Clear!

374
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,480
Compression.

375
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,321
I'll intubate him.

376
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,960
Tube!

377
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,683
Okay.

378
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,818
Get an Ambu bag.

379
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,538
Move your hand.

380
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,771
Okay.

381
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,450
Give him 1 ml of epinephrine every

382
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,720
3 minutes and pump the Ambu bag
mask once every 6 seconds.

383
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,680
Yes, sir.

384
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,975
Switch your hand every 2 minutes,
and check his heart rate.

385
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,507
Yes, sir!

386
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,060
He has no pulse.
There's pulseless electrical activity.

387
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,236
Okay. Compression.

388
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,070
When did you get the call regarding
this man?

389
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,630
15:48, sir.

390
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,569
He was standing at a bus station,
but suddenly collapsed

391
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:58,940
and someone called 911 for him.

392
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,540
When we'd arrived, the other party
had been performing CPR on him.

393
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,580
What was his initial rhythm?

394
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,040
He had a vfib, so we used
a defibrillator 2 times.

395
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,786
So his heart stopped 17 minutes ago, huh?

396
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,480
Do you know any personal
information about him?

397
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,420
He had his ID in his wallet so we
were able to contact his wife.

398
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,250
She's on her way here now.

399
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,380
All right. Thank you for your hard work.

400
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,300
Doctor, there's another wound on
the patient's back.

401
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,260
-Hey, Geosan fellow!
-Yes, that's me!

402
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,470
Keep compressing the patient's chest
until we get him back.

403
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,400
Don't give up, okay?

404
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,569
Yes, sir!

405
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,303
His rhythm, please.

406
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,577
Asystole.

407
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,816
I think it's near the
thoracolumbar junction.

408
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,965
I felt something hard around there.

409
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,358
Oh, I think it's a blade.

410
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,642
Did it break and get stuck in there
when he got stabbed?

411
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,445
Why aren't the general surgeons here yet?

412
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,599
Huh? They're so slow.

413
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,700
Grab them by the collar and drag
them here if you have to!

414
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,839
Yes, I understand.

415
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,415
What took you so long?

416
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,510
What kind of patient do we have?

417
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,340
It's a patient with stab wounds.
Dr Nam carried him here.

418
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,540
He got stabbed in about 5 places,

419
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,267
and has a blade stuck in his TL junction.

420
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,515
Any nerve injuries?

421
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,008
He's exhibiting symptoms of damage
in his lower extremities.

422
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,584
Hey, how did you injure your lip?

423
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,150
What about his abdomen?

424
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,838
I think he has two bowel perforations
on his left side.

425
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,660
But we won't know if it's the small
bowel or large bowel until we do a CT.

426
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,290
Judging from the ultrasound,
the wound is close to his stomach.

427
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,463
And the location of the wound
suggests that, too.

428
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,052
Did you get into a fight with someone?

429
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,588
I'm not a kid, you know!

430
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,249
What's wrong with him?

431
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,824
Is he mad about what I said?

432
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,154
Yes, Chief.

433
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,661
You should come to the ER for a bit.

434
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,519
-Father!
-Honey!

435
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:55,120
What brings you here?

436
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,620
We heard that my father fainted at
a bus stop and rushed here!

437
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,390
The paramedics told us that they
were heading to Doldam.

438
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,290
Oh, the doctors are in the middle
of treating him at the moment.

439
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,730
So please come this way and
wait for a bit.

440
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,730
Yes, sir.

441
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,200
Oh, how could this happen? Oh, Honey!

442
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,760
Don't cry, Mom.

443
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,332
I'll check his rhythm now!

444
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,539
There's a pulse. It's an ROSC.

445
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,133
His BP is 90/60. .

446
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,820
You need to get a c-line in him, sir.

447
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,896
What?

448
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,516
Um, yes. Yes, please pass me a c-line.

449
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,024
-There it is.
-Yeah.

450
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,438
It's not looking good.

451
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,242
Dr Kang Dong-joo is here.

452
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,530
Why are you here by yourself?

453
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,989
Where's the other brat?

454
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,740
Other brat? Who?

455
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,910
We had some of the Geosan surgical
staff come down here today.

456
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,250
Why would Director Do do that?

457
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,591
He's not usually that generous.

458
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,840
I asked you where the other punk is.
I called both of you together.

459
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,220
Well, I'm not really sure.

460
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,553
I'm here.

461
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,470
It’s John Doe patient.
He has five in his abdomen.

462
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,010
The three on his right side are shallow,
but the two on his left are quite deep.

463
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,461
We gave him a buffer solution and he

464
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,980
has a blade lodged in his TL junction
since it seems to have broken off.

465
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,750
Then, will we have to carry out
a co-surgery?

466
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,950
Yeah.

467
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,120
Which side do you want to work on first?

468
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,190
His stomach.

469
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,250
Because at the very least, he may

470
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,690
be paralyzed with a spinal injury
but he won't die.

471
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,660
Okay, then.

472
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,050
I'll head to the OR first to get
everything set up.

473
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,900
Just a moment.

474
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,895
I just received word about this.

475
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,821
You're going to treat a patient with
no guardian, and without consent?

476
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,640
This isn't a surgery that a tiny

477
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,344
hospital like this would be able
to handle.

478
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,710
Don't overdo it here, and send him
over to a larger hospital.

479
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,920
Hey, the size of a hospital doesn't
matter when it comes to surgeries.

480
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,250
It's about the doctor's competence.

481
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,550
I'm just worried that something
may go wrong.

482
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,420
If you go ahead and operate on him
without consent from his guardian

483
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,550
and something goes wrong,
what will you do then?

484
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,431
It's not like we can ask you to take
full responsibility either.

485
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,288
Excuse me.

486
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,250
Based on the laws regarding emergency
medical care when the patient is

487
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,280
incapable of making decisions regarding
medical care and has nobody to

488
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,150
consent in his stead then the law stating
that we need consent is void in

489
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,896
this situation.

490
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,627
That's all.

491
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,123
Hey, you heard that?

492
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,025
Such is the law, man.

493
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,610
What should we do?

494
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,740
Move him to the OR as we'd
originally planned.

495
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,751
-Go make the preparations.
-Okay.

496
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,120
-It's Do In-bum, right?
-Yes, sir.

497
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,550
You do the surgery today.

498
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,971
And you assist, Kang Dong-joo.

499
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
Why am I the assistant?

500
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,809
What do you mean?

501
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,490
Are you saying that you don't want to?
Then just stay out of it.

502
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,390
Then, may I go in instead of him, sir?

503
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,820
No, you take care of this cardiac patient.

504
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,609
I'll take care of the spine.

505
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,860
That'll be all!

506
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,957
You saw that, right?

507
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,042
I told you that he's like that.

508
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,043
He goes wild for the scent of blood,
just like a crazy man.

509
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,820
Nurse Park. Let's move the patient.

510
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,910
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
Excuse us. We'll be going now.

512
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,360
Geez... Hey! Watch it!

513
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,180
Oh wow, I'm so sorry.

514
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,862
What are you doing?
Hurry and follow Teacher Kim.

515
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,434
I'll take care of my own business,
thank you!

516
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,172
I'm not a child!

517
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,393
Wow, he sure knows how to hold a grudge.

518
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,940
Are all guys like that, Nurse Park?

519
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,086
I have no idea.

520
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,813
Excuse me!

521
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,703
Watch where you're going, yeah?

522
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,261
Are your eyes just for decoration
or something?

523
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,077
Darn it!

524
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,540
It's waterproof.

525
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,894
Put it on.

526
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,678
You shouldn't go into the OR with
an injured hand.

527
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,654
Did I do something against you, or what?

528
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,172
I won't know unless you tell me!

529
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,890
What's your problem?

530
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,345
I just don't like the fact that you
exist, period!

531
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,664
Happy now?

532
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,560
Wait! Wait a second!

533
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,361
What's wrong with me existing?

534
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,840
What did my existence ever do to you?

535
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,867
-Let go, right now.
-Tell me!

536
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,353
Why don't you like my existence?
What's wrong with it, huh?

537
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,191
Are you seriously asking me as
if you don't know?

538
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,629
Am I supposed to know?

539
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,544
Are you putting on an innocent act,
or are you just ignoring it?

540
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,122
What are you talking about?

541
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,631
Figures.

542
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,734
Father may be the director of
Geosan University Hospital and all but

543
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,538
it'd be a bit much even for him to

544
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,420
announce the fact that he
has a child from an extramarital affair.

545
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,270
Extramarital what?

546
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,637
All right, already. I got it.

547
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,284
I'll pretend I get it,
so stop bothering me, already.

548
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,723
Okay?

549
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,751
A child from an extramarital affair?

550
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,809
Who?

551
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,589
Me?

552
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,809
Wait a second.

553
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,748
Don't use your hands when you're
fighting from now on.

554
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,589
If there's someone you really want
to beat up, just kick them.

555
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,367
Or just let yourself get hit, instead.

556
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,727
Why is it me?

557
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,420
What do you mean?

558
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,360
The reason why you made me come
to Doldam Hospital and the reason

559
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,300
you put me in charge of a surgery
as soon as I got here.

560
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,430
Why? Does it seem like I dragged you here

561
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,330
on purpose and made you miserable
to piss off your dad?

562
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,294
Am I wrong to assume that?

563
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,292
Stop it with that nonsense and
focus on preparing for surgery.

564
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,633
Where's Kang Dong-joo?
Why isn't he coming?

565
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,893
Wound Medicine

566
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,514
Are you okay?

567
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,986
Sorry about that.

568
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,340
-Call Dr Kang Dong-joo one more time.
-Yes, ma'am.

569
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,949
No, there's no need to call him.

570
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,018
I'll be the assistant today.

571
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,198
You're going to do that yourself,
Teacher Kim?

572
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,310
Teacher Kim...

573
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,168
Oh, he's here. Dr Kang Dong-joo!

574
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,290
I'm sorry for being late.

575
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,723
Oh, whatever.
I don't need you, so get out.

576
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,830
Doctor.

577
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,447
I don't need you! Get out!

578
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,870
Let's get started.

579
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,870
Teacher Kim.

580
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,568
Go ahead.

581
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,147
Let me witness your skills for myself.

582
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,978
I'll start the surgery now, then.

583
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,667
Scalpel.

584
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,278
Gouge.

585
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,400
Focus!

586
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,105
Yes, sir.

587
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,410
His heart is beating again, but

588
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,278
there's only a small chance that
he'll wake up.

589
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,504
And even if he does, it'll be hard
for him to resume his everyday life.

590
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,991
How's his brain?

591
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,656
He has no sign of
hypoxic brain damage yet.

592
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,930
If he doesn't have much brain damage,
isn't it worth giving TTM a shot?

593
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,997
TTM?

594
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,826
It'll be difficult due to the cost of
the procedure.

595
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,042
I'll speak to the patient's guardian.

596
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,743
What?

597
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,670
Targeted temperature management?

598
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,825
Yes.

599
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,650
No matter what the cause may have been,
if the heart stops once,

600
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,885
there's a high chance that it may
do so again within a 24-hour period.

601
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,720
So in order to find out what caused this

602
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,190
we did a blood test and
a CT scan of his brain.

603
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,833
A CT scan of his brain?

604
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,690
Doesn't that cost a lot of money?

605
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,730
What are you saying, Mom?

606
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,100
He needed to get all those tests done.

607
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,470
Based on the CT results, his brain
isn't as damaged as we'd feared.

608
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
Oh.

609
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,570
In instances like this...

610
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,270
we do something called targeted
temperature management and maintain

611
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,040
the patient's body temperature at
a lower one than normal.

612
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,810
By doing that, we minimize brain injury.

613
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,117
So if you do that, does it mean that
he'll be able to wake up?

614
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,599
It doesn't mean that he'll wake up
for sure just because of this treatment.

615
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,837
The statistics of someone who's had

616
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:07,596
his or her heart stop outside a hospital
and surviving that is four out of 100.

617
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,600
And among those people, those who
make a complete recovery and can

618
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,260
go back to their normal lives is just
one of four.

619
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Then, what if he gets that treatment
done on him?

620
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,870
You can double his chances.

621
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,265
Then we have to get that done for
him, of course.

622
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,834
The issue is with the price of the
treatment.

623
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,619
How much will it be?

624
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,174
The cost of the supplies alone is
1.6 thousand dollars.

625
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,672
To be honest, we're not too well-off,
so we have state-sponsored insurance.

626
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,155
But the supplies for this procedure
are not covered by insurance so

627
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,785
there's no way that you'll be able
to get it covered by them.

628
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,096
So 100 % of the cost will fall upon
the patient.

629
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,641
What do we do?

630
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,797
Please do it anyway.

631
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,650
-Sun-ah.
-Don't worry, Mom.

632
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,290
I'll get that money, no matter
what it takes.

633
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,390
But what about the other hospital fees?

634
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
Mom!

635
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,630
Dad lived his entire life like this for
us which is why he ended up like this!

636
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,587
If we can't do this for him,
I'd feel so sorry toward Dad!

637
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,070
Yes.

638
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,200
Doctor.

639
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,400
We'll leave him in your capable hands.

640
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,000
Please, save my father.

641
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,010
I'll do my best.

642
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,580
No.

643
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,780
That treatment isn't covered.

644
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,980
Exactly!

645
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,920
Why is an important treatment like
this not covered?

646
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,980
It's not like it's cosmetic like
plastic surgery!

647
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,060
What am I supposed to do when that's
what the higher-ups have decided?

648
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,491
At any rate, it's a no.

649
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,060
Why would we waste all that money
on someone with a low chance of recovery?

650
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,613
And what if he never wakes up?

651
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,000
There's barely an 8 percent chance
it'll succeed.

652
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,160
One out of 100.

653
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,730
Even if it had a one percent chance of
succeeding

654
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,000
shouldn't we at least try?

655
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,250
But what if you fail?

656
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,070
What about the financial burden
that the family will have to take on?

657
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,310
And what if they say that they
can't repay this debt?

658
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,110
What about the financial burden we
will have to take on if that happens?

659
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,950
That's not a doctor's concern.
It should be the higher-ups' instead.

660
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,280
I can't even treat a patient, as a
doctor, because of them!

661
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,580
If you're that dissatisfied with how
the higher-ups do things, why don't

662
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,720
you become one of them and change
this broken system, then?

663
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,060
No doctor has the time to do that!

664
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,790
You should be doing that for us, Chief.

665
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,301
I'm not "Chief" anymore.
I'm a section chief now, Dr Yoon.

666
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,866
As of today, I've been promoted
to "Section Chief of Administration."

667
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,130
Oh, really? Congrats!

668
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,094
Thank you.

669
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,270
I'm going to do the treatment,
so just be aware of that!

670
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,340
You can't. You absolutely can't!

671
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,334
I'm entirely opposed to this!

672
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,640
Chief!

673
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,298
It's Section Chief now. Section Chief!

674
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,416
I'm sorry, Section Chief.

675
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,312
There are cops outside right now, sir.

676
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,135
I think they're here because of the
patient with the stab wounds.

677
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,475
All right.

678
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,861
And, no, you can't!

679
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,276
Understand, Dr Yoon?

680
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,084
Chief, I mean, Section Chief!

681
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,200
Let's do it.

682
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,240
You really want to do this?

683
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,710
You trust my intuition, right, In-soo?

684
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,540
I definitely think that this patient
will wake up, so let's do it.

685
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,240
What if I end up going down too
because of your "intuition"?

686
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,558
Are you going to take
responsibility for that?

687
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,320
You'll do it, right?
Thank you for agreeing.

688
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,570
I got a call from the station, you see.

689
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,120
Hey, hey, hey, Seo-Jung!

690
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,757
That Crazy Whale.
I never should've run into you again.

691
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,643
Where is this place? Who am I?

692
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,160
Geez...

693
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,025
Hey, Miss!

694
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,810
Shouldn't you treat a patient if
he showed up?

695
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,940
-What is it?
-I have no idea.

696
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,150
He keeps on begging me to give
him a vitamin drip.

697
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,648
And I'm so busy as it is.

698
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,505
-That person?
-Yeah.

699
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,422
Yeah, it's me.

700
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,470
He is getting surgery done on
him right now.

701
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,734
Geez.

702
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,310
Oh, don't you worry.

703
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,994
I'll finish things up nicely, so just
make the soup delicious, okay?

704
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,680
The beef soup, I mean.

705
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,092
Okay.

706
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,030
How's your condition, Mr Patient?

707
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,977
It's not good, obviously.

708
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,350
Why?

709
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,770
You seem completely fine.

710
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,440
You can go back home now.

711
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,540
Shush, and get me an IV.

712
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,010
You know, the one with
Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

713
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,380
You have that, don't you?
So stick that in me.

714
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,340
I want that before I go.

715
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,000
Go to the outpatient wing if you
want that.

716
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,369
You sure talk a lot, girl.

717
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,660
Stop talking back, and just put the

718
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,250
darned thing on if you don't have
a death wish.

719
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,460
Leave while I'm still being nice
about it, Mister.

720
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:13,522
Or I'll call the cops.

721
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,719
Want me to do that?

722
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,670
Do you seriously have a death wish?

723
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,670
Oh, no.

724
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,083
I want to live a nice, long life.

725
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,512
Mr Go?

726
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,927
Yes?

727
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,820
This person is leaving.
Help him, won't you?

728
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,117
And who the heck is Mr Go?

729
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,936
Huh?

730
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,578
Why are you here?

731
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,360
Is the surgery over already?

732
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,070
I got kicked out.

733
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,677
Kicked out? By whom?

734
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,247
Who else would kick me out of the OR?

735
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,250
Hey, how could you actually leave
just because he said that?

736
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,216
You should've done everything you
could have to stay!

737
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,090
Here, let me see.

738
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,820
-Ugh.
-Geez, you.

739
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,093
It's not like it's the first time
Teacher Kim has yelled at you.

740
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,030
It's about time for you to get used to
him and his ways, isn't it?

741
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,730
It's not like surgeries like that are
common, either!

742
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,658
It would've been so much help to you to
at least watch the procedure.

743
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,772
Right?

744
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,152
Be my girlfriend, Yoon Seo-Jung.

745
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,689
What are you saying, now?

746
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,546
I'll forgive you for saying that
I was childish.

747
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,172
So let's date.

748
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,600
You little brat...

749
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,458
How dare you speak like that to
your senior?

750
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,339
What a stubborn squirt.

751
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,588
I can't speak informally to you?

752
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,316
Anyway...

753
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,305
Just get back into the OR.

754
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,340
And beg for forgiveness.
Just beg and beg, no matter what.

755
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,210
Tell him you'll do your best no matter

756
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,010
what you're assigned to do even if
you're a mere assistant.

757
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,042
You got that?

758
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,780
I have to try at least three times.

759
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,910
I'll ask you two more times.

760
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,833
So give it some serious thought
before answering me.

761
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,321
You didn't listen to a word I said,
did you?

762
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,962
I'll go on ahead, then.

763
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,451
One is always asking me out
whenever our eyes meet while the

764
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,890
other one is writing himself a
ridiculous drama about his family.

765
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,580
Geez, how exhausting.

766
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,868
Sorry for inconveniencing you
with my crazy self.

767
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,777
Man, that wretched woman.

768
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:21,774
Hey, you.

769
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:27,985
Yes?

770
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,068
You got a light?

771
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,467
I don't smoke.

772
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:44,884
This is a no-smoking facility, too.

773
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,272
You are so cranky!

774
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,230
Where's Chief Jang?

775
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,970
He went to meet with the cops
that came here not too long ago.

776
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,340
There were policemen here?

777
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,222
Yes.

778
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,410
Oh. About the patient that came in here
with those stab wounds...

779
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,527
They said that those injuries may be
related to gang activity of some sort.

780
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,187
Are your eyes only for decoration,
or something?

781
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,190
The patient with the stab wounds that
Dr Nam carried in was stabbed

782
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,920
in 5 different places, and has a blade
lodged in his TL junction from

783
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,107
being stabbed in the back.

784
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,400
Where are Chief Jang and the
police officers?

785
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,584
Near the ER.

786
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,090
Geez, where did they go?

787
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,302
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

788
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,499
What are you doing here?

789
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,220
Chief Jang.

790
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,020
As of today, I'm Section Chief Jang.

791
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,950
I got a promotion, you see!

792
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,190
Where are the cops?

793
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,112
Huh?

794
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,344
They all left.

795
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,943
Is there something you wanted to
discuss with them?

796
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,248
I think that a gang member is in
the hospital right now.

797
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:12,260
A gang member?

798
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,600
They said that there may have been gang
activity linked to that stabbed patient.

799
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,700
-Didn't the cops say that?
-Yes, they did.

800
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,140
I just saw a guy who had something like

801
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,412
a blade wrapped in newspaper near
his waist in the bathroom!

802
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,010
Call the cops again first, and let all the
employees know, as well.

803
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,450
I'm going to head to the OR.

804
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,504
Yes, I understand.

805
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,160
Hello? This is the police, correct?

806
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,920
This is Doldam Hospital!

807
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,993
It's me again, Chief.

808
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,820
I think that this hospital is a lot more
chaotic than we'd anticipated.

809
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,430
This time, they have a gang member
on their hands.

810
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,680
Who are you looking for?

811
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,110
Where is Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

812
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,712
She's in the hybrid room
taking care of a patient.

813
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,380
Oh, I see.

814
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,585
I think a suspicious person has come
into the hospital, so watch over the ER.

815
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,902
Yes, I just received word from Chief...
I mean, Section Chief Jang.

816
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,130
Don't worry, Doctor.

817
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,108
Okay.

818
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,400
I'll leave it to you, then.

819
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,352
Yes.

820
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,552
Get over there, quickly!

821
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,020
Have you seen that suspicious man?

822
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,771
Don't be shaken! Don't be shaken!

823
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,952
Come out!

824
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,656
Come in, men! Hurry!

825
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,077
Search every nook and cranny!

826
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,255
It seems like it was his small bowel.

827
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,402
Irrigation.

828
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:23,864
Suction.

829
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,820
Gauze.

830
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,470
Go get five more RBC packs.

831
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,690
Yes, sir.

832
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,651
Will he be okay?

833
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,156
For now, yeah.

834
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,904
I've found the source of the bleeding.

835
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,092
Hemostat.

836
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,650
Please give me something to close
it up with.

837
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,005
Oh, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

838
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,574
Hey, what the heck?

839
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,860
I told you to get out
so why the heck did you crawl back in?

840
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,238
We have an emergency on our hands.

841
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,907
An emergency?

842
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,235
What do you mean?

843
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,901
We suspect that the gang member who
attacked the patient is in this hospital.

844
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:23,360
What, are you scared that he might
bust in here, or something?

845
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,298
You never know..

846
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,842
-As a precaution...
-Whatever, get out!

847
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,229
No, I'll stay.

848
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,222
What?

849
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,374
Hey, even if that thug busts into this OR

850
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:48,126
you won't be of much help just
by being in here.

851
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:50,538
So get out, because you're getting
on my nerves!

852
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,427
I'm staying.

853
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,620
Go and beg for his forgiveness.

854
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,549
Beg and beg, no matter what.

855
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,238
What is it that I did so wrong, anyway?

856
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,161
Was it so wrong of me to be just
a couple of minutes late?

857
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,214
There's that, but also the useless
thoughts that led you to be late!

858
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,410
"Useless thoughts"?

859
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,216
What did you think from the moment
I told you to be Do In-bum's assistant?

860
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,271
You got pissed and angry.

861
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,820
And you didn't want to do it!

862
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,186
And you were wondering if you should
even do it or not, weren't you?

863
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,984
Hey, you think this is your
playground or something?

864
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,816
I don't care if you two are fighting,
or whatever.

865
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,311
When you come in here, you forget
about all that and focus on the patient.

866
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,110
How dare you bring your useless
thoughts into the OR?

867
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,740
You think you could do your best
for this patient like that?

868
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,580
Huh?

869
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,201
You don't have the right to stand
here or to perform surgery.

870
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,224
Get out.

871
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,050
I've stopped the bleeding.

872
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,070
I'll do a segmental resection and
then an end-to-end anastomosis.

873
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,740
After that, we'll stitch him up as soon
as we can and move on to the spine.

874
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,760
Okay.

875
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,285
Pass me that, please.

876
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,462
I hope he holds on.

877
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,435
Let me ask you just one thing.

878
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,960
What?

879
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,300
You could've done the TTM if you wanted.

880
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,017
Why did you push me to do it?

881
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,800
Well, because he was your patient
from the very start.

882
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,986
No, there's definitely another reason.
So, what is it?

883
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,840
-Tell me the truth.
-Oh, come on.

884
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,989
There's no other reason.

885
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,692
I'm going to get some water.

886
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,168
Why water, all of the sudden?

887
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,736
That little brat...
Something is definitely up, here.

888
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,487
Right?

889
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,830
She says that she's
an EM-board certified doctor studying to

890
00:54:14,144 --> 00:54:17,554
be double-certified but she's acting
as if she's a mere intern.

891
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,275
Just as I thought...

892
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,166
There's definitely something up.

893
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,165
Isn't that right, Dr Jung?

894
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,145
I don't know.

895
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,143
How could I tell him now that
I'm nonclinical personnel?

896
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,338
Geez, I can't say it. I definitely can't.

897
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,320
Restricted Area Surgery in Progress

898
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,341
I want to go in.

899
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,040
Hurry! Let's go up!

900
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,533
He's not there?

901
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,539
No, sir.

902
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,763
Are you sure you did a thorough search?

903
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,436
Maybe Dr Kang Dong-joo made a mistake?

904
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,555
You think so?

905
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,982
Man.

906
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,058
Hey. Excuse me.

907
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,384
You're still here?

908
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,605
He's in there right now, right?

909
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,080
What?

910
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,028
The jerk who was stabbed.

911
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,918
He's getting operated on right now,
right?

912
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,035
Right?

913
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,034
We'll be done after these sutures.

914
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,158
We'll switch his position as soon
as you're done with that.

915
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,100
Dr Nam, how's the patient?

916
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,013
He's fine ever since we got the
bleeding under control.

917
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,760
-Prone position?
-Yeah.

918
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,792
Is it okay if I press on his stomach?

919
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,307
I think it'll be okay, as long as it's
more toward his pelvis.

920
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,779
-Cut.
-Cut.

921
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,707
-All finished.
-All right, switch his position.

922
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,050
Hey. Hey, hey!

923
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:47,970
You're ready, right?

924
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,232
Okay.

925
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,924
Dr Yoon...

926
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,390
Why, you little brats...

927
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,602
Hey, how dare you crawl in here
looking like that?

928
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,430
I'm sorry, Doctor.

929
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,702
I didn't mean to come in.

930
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,069
I'm sorry, Doctor!

931
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,701
I'm truly sorry!

932
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,847
Walk in there slowly.
Nice and slowly, now.

933
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,297
If you make any sudden movements,
you might get cut, girl.

934
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,699
Hey, you.

935
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,327
Move back. Now!

936
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:56,676
Dr Yoon, are you okay?

937
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,623
I'm sorry.

938
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,640
Who are you?

939
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,539
Who the heck are you to be breaking
into a hospital's OR and doing this?

940
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,376
Who's in charge, here?

941
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,362
Who's the person with the most
authority in here, huh?

942
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,760
It's me.

943
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,078
What do you want?

944
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,720
Stop the surgery right now.

945
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,698
If you don't, this girl dies.

946
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,460
Get the heck away from that man, now!

947
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,826
No!

948
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,980
I won’t give up on this surgery.

949
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:00,880
Let me tell you this again.

950
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,480
In the worst case scenario,
you can lose your license.

951
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,420
Don't touch anyone else but me.

952
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,250
Don't be a coward, getting others
involved.

953
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,760
As of today, Dr Bu Yong-joo is

954
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,490
forbidden from performing any
medical procedures.

955
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,053
The official term for this is
