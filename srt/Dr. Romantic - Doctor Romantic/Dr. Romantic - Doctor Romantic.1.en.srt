00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,592
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:35,346
An age of injustice.

3
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:38,233
Please, save my father!

4
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,207
My father was here first!

5
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:44,123
Honey... Please someone help.

6
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,748
He came after my father!

7
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,396
An age of inequality.

8
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,973
An age full of dissatisfaction and doubt.

9
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,700
8:23 PM. Kang Won-hyung has passed away.

10
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:11,803
Father...

11
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:15,899
Father!

12
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,145
Honey!

13
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:24,785
Thankfully, the surgery ended well.
The assemblyman is safe.

14
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,472
Thank you, Doctor!

15
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,694
My father got here first though.

16
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,409
My father...

17
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:44,658
My father got here
way before that person did!

18
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,930
Let go! Let go of me!

19
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:55,455
My father got here before that person did!

20
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,451
He should've been treated first!

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,503
My father... Let go of me!

22
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:04,152
It became an age in which patients
were discriminated against...

23
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:08,844
...based on who they were
and how much money they had.

24
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,100
Why the heck did you play
with a person's life, huh?

25
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,780
Hospitals and doctors
shouldn't be doing that!

26
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,538
This is the police, right?

27
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,509
This is the emergency room
at Geosan University Hospital.

28
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,982
But at that moment...

29
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,244
...there was someone who came out to us.

30
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,218
My father!

31
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,157
Let go of me!

32
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:48,409
Let go.

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,874
One.

34
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,129
Two.

35
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,101
Three.

36
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:06,213
BU YONG-JOO

37
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,947
Are you awake now?

38
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:17,320
Do you feel a bit better now that you
came and bashed a couple of things?

39
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,663
It has nothing to do with you, mister.

40
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,501
Don't get it wrong.

41
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,505
Just because you vented
your frustrations,

42
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,917
it doesn't mean you've gotten revenge.

43
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,317
Even if you go around swinging
a baseball bat for 100 days,

44
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,859
those people probably
won't even remember your face.

45
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,324
If you really want to get revenge...

46
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:46,785
...become a much better
human being than them.

47
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:52,833
Don't get revenge with anger,
but with skill.

48
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,368
Understood?

49
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:01,378
If you don't change,
nothing else will either.

50
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,625
Doctor!

51
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:29,369
Doctor.

52
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,007
Don't get revenge with anger,
but with skill.

53
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:35,442
Understood?

54
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,487
How is someone like me
supposed to do something like that?

55
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,864
Especially someone like me?

56
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:08,008
If you don't change,
nothing else will either.

57
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,836
KANG DONG-JOO

58
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,701
Dr Kang Dong-Joo?

59
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,383
HOW TO PUT AN ELEPHANT IN A REFRIGERATOR

60
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,538
SEPTEMBER, 2011

61
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,430
Hey, hey, hey.

62
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:35,377
Have you heard that there's a real monster
among the new medical interns?

63
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:36,129
Monster?

64
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,032
I heard he doesn't care about seniority
and treats his seniors like garbage.

65
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,301
He gets sassy with them,
and even gets in their faces sometimes!

66
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,580
Dr Lee said that his blood pressure
went up so much because of him

67
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,839
that he almost had to declare himself dead!

68
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,132
Apparently, he's also never missed
a first place in his life...

69
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,884
...and apparently, he's so great
that the chief surgeon wants him so much.

70
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,292
In other words, he's untouchable!

71
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,935
But still, he's only an intern.

72
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,856
I don't want to.

73
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,395
What?

74
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:06,093
Hey.

75
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:09,447
Why is it that you never do any favors
for your senior and always give me sass?

76
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,732
I didn't become an intern
to be your coffee boy.

77
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,065
Why did you become an intern then?

78
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:15,426
To fix people.

79
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:19,469
Did you hear that?

80
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,801
An intern said he's going to fix people!

81
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:25,310
Hey, how about you work
on your nasty personality first, Intern?

82
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,759
You think that someone
who doesn't even obey their seniors

83
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,515
will be able to treat patients well?

84
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,119
Don't say that as if those two things
have anything to do with each other.

85
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,688
Getting coffee and treating patients
are two completely different matters.

86
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,256
What did he say?

87
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,269
You know, it doesn't take much
to get a gist of someone's character!

88
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:42,065
Then don't send me
to get your coffee for you.

89
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:48,057
I won't run stupid errands for others
unless it's related to hospital work.

90
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,938
Stupid errands? Hey, what did you say?

91
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,946
-Hey! Hey!
-Oh, come now.

92
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,341
Just ignore him, Senior!

93
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,845
He's untouchable, isn't he?
Just leave him alone.

94
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,646
Untouchable, whatever.

95
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:01,782
There was a huge accident
at a construction site!

96
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,496
Four injured patients
will be here in two minutes.

97
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,032
Make an emergency call to Dr Won first!

98
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:06,885
Got it!

99
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:14,759
Bring them in this way.

100
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,434
His BP and heartbeat is regular.

101
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,503
And there's an injury on his right wrist.

102
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,182
He said that the area near his thumb
is numb.

103
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,138
Can you feel that?

104
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,473
-No.
-Feels numb?

105
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:28,562
-Hey, Intern!
-Yes?

106
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:29,879
He seems to have broken something.

107
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,145
His circulation is okay, but I think
his median nerve has been damaged.

108
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,414
so get him a hand splint
and perform a wrist series.

109
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,810
Take the X-ray in as a forearm
anterior-posterior view lateral.

110
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:37,199
And perform a reduction
as soon as possible.

111
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,076
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,253
Dr Yoon!

113
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,792
-Over here!
-Okay!

114
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,150
He barely has a pulse.

115
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,426
I think we'll have to perform
a popliteal artery dissection.

116
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,828
Perform a low extremity angiography
on him, please.

117
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,896
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:52,132
Hey, where the heck are all the interns?

119
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,147
Get the heck in here, already!

120
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,071
My mom got here first though.

121
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,174
Dr Kang.

122
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,875
They need you.

123
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,011
My mom got here first.

124
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,183
And she's quite ill too!

125
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,229
Can you come by for a second?

126
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,458
There's a patient
with a respiratory problem.

127
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,481
How much fluid did you give him so far?

128
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:21,287
About two liters.
Preparing for emergency surgery.

129
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,772
-And the tests?
-Negative.

130
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,892
-And nothing else is definite yet.
-Doctor...

131
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,333
How long was he kept waiting?

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,336
The conditions at the scene were bad,
so it took over an hour to get to him.

133
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,104
Hey, Intern. Get him a Foley catheter.

134
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,539
There's a patient in critical condition
that came first.

135
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,559
She has a history of COPD,
and she currently has SIRS.

136
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,411
I'm afraid that
she may have pneumonia sepsis.

137
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,645
How are that patient's vitals now?

138
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,881
She's at 100/70 so she's stable
for now, but...

139
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,712
Then get a Foley catheter
in this man first!

140
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,544
Please check her chest
and perform an ABGA.

141
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:47,187
Don't you see this patient's
blood pressure dropping?

142
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:47,963
Isn't it clear who needs help right now?

143
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,959
I told you, she might have pneumonia sepsis!

144
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,328
-Hey, Intern!
-Yes?

145
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:58,265
Get over here and replace
this annoying jerk!

146
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,766
Get out of my way!

147
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,844
Move, move!

148
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,139
This patient is in a critical state!

149
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:49,790
Doctor. It's Dr Yoon Seo-Jung from the ER.

150
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,018
They say there's a patient
from the construction site...

151
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,187
...with an abdomen penetrating injury.

152
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,788
Sure. Give me the phone.

153
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,691
How's the patient's condition?

154
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,518
He's a 45-year-old man...

155
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,729
...and has a one meter long metal rod
stuck inside his abdomen.

156
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,552
On one side of the rod is a slab of concrete
that they couldn't remove.

157
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,339
Focus!

158
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,520
Where is the rod, exactly?

159
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,012
The rod is running through his lower...

160
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,826
...back to his upper abdomen
and is angled upward.

161
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:17,793
And his vitals?

162
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,168
Thankfully, his blood pressure is at 119,
so it's normal and his pulse rate is 130.

163
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,518
No massive bleeding.

164
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:26,186
He may have internal bleeding,

165
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,388
so perform a FAST on him
and stabilize his vitals.

166
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,368
I'll take care of it.

167
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,827
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,011
Did you all hear that, right?

169
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:34,494
We're ending this in 30 minutes.

170
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,484
Get your heads in the game.

171
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,578
-Get him hooked up.
-Yes, ma'am.

172
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,381
Put the Cline in like this
and prepare a Foley to put in him too.

173
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,337
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,487
6Move! Please move!

175
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,790
Here's the monitor!

176
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:11,934
No!

177
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,013
-Get Dr Nam, quickly!
-Yes, sir!

178
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,582
His BP is 90/60!
Levels are dropping quickly!

179
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,266
Give him an emergency transfusion,
and pump two more RBC in him.

180
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:36,013
-And tell them to prepare 20 more!
-Yes, sir.

181
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,319
-Get him some oxygen!
-Yes.

182
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:47,801
Sir, it's the ER again.
I think there's been an accident.

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,403
Put them through.

184
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:53,740
Doctor, the steel rod in the patient
has fallen out accidentally.

185
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,447
His BP is falling fast!

186
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,612
Idiots.

187
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:00,547
Where's Yoon Seo-Jung?

188
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,099
Yoon Seo-Jung!

189
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,324
What are you doing, Yoon Seo-Jung?
The doctor is on the line!

190
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,797
Seo-Jung! Yoon Seo-Jung!

191
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:10,776
Can you hear me?

192
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:16,897
Answer me, you little brat!

193
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,600
What are you doing?

194
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,804
Yes, yes, yes, sir! I'm here!

195
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,805
Go ahead!

196
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:26,006
10 minutes.

197
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:28,274
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

198
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,912
So just have him hang on for 10 minutes!

199
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,235
You understood?

200
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,647
Yes, yes. Yes, I understand!

201
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,245
His blood pressure is at 80/50,
and it's still dropping!

202
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,554
Hey, Intern! Get more gauze!

203
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,841
Yes, sir!

204
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,577
-I need a draper.
-Yes, ma'am.

205
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:08,065
Hey, what are you planning to do?

206
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,861
At this rate,
he can injure his thoracic aorta.

207
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:10,764
We don't have any time.

208
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:12,553
So you're going to open him up,
here and now?

209
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:18,892
If we lose any more time, he'll have
too much internal hemorrhaging.

210
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,612
Then we won't be able to see...

211
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,675
I'll do the best.

212
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,572
Seo-Jung...

213
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,213
-Scalpel.
-Hey, Seo-Jung!

214
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,821
Give me a lot of gauze.

215
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,735
Hey, Dr Yoon. Seo-Jung!

216
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,221
Stop!

217
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,119
Shut your mouth for a bit.

218
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,718
Wait, is she looking for the artery?

219
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:57,800
Here it is.

220
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:58,851
You got it?

221
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,431
Yes, I did.

222
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,666
I don't think it's a main artery,
based on its location.

223
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,263
I think it's a splenic artery.

224
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,536
The patient's condition is stabilizing,
Doctor.

225
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:24,618
Oh, it's the doctor!

226
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,220
Seo-Jung! Dr Moon.

227
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,016
What happened?

228
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:33,961
Oh, his vitals
are being stabilized again, sir.

229
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:36,943
What about the bleeding?

230
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,032
There was some bleeding from
his splenic artery but I'm holding it down.

231
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,315
What do you mean you're holding it?
With what?

232
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,496
My index finger.

233
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,182
You crazy girl.

234
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,561
Okay, send him up
to the operating room right now.

235
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,487
Yes, sir!

236
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,090
We're moving him
to the operating room now.

237
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:03,991
Yes, ma'am.

238
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:05,559
Doctor!

239
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,995
-Hey, move out of the way!
-Yes, sir!

240
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,564
Excuse us! Please move!

241
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,700
Please move!

242
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,383
Please move!

243
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,998
Please move!

244
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,625
I'll leave the rest to you.

245
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,837
Yes, sir.
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

246
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,065
Take it easy.

247
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm sorry that there was an accident,
Doctor.

248
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,062
It's fine.

249
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,750
I'll take care of things from here on out.

250
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,221
Good job.

251
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:09,823
Okay.

252
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:32,079
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung.
You were so awesome today.

253
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,146
Awesome!

254
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,549
No, I was just lucky.

255
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,117
Crazy Whale!

256
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,353
I have a new nickname for you now.

257
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,279
Queen of the Index Finger!

258
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:46,260
How can you manage to eat
in this situation?

259
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,663
What do you mean, sir?

260
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:51,785
There was a patient
with pneumonia sepsis.

261
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:52,933
Why didn't you call me?

262
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:57,437
Oh, I had to send that patient
with the steel rod in him to the OR.

263
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,834
But that patient came in
before the construction workers did!

264
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,278
Her vitals were fine
and she only had a slight fever so...

265
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,246
So a slight fever isn't an emergency?

266
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,720
Does someone have to be bleeding out
on the floor with their artery torn...

267
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:11,652
...for them to be in critical condition
to you?

268
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,153
No, that's not what I meant.

269
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,022
That patient had ARDS.

270
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,149
She would've been dead if...

271
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:18,992
...Kang Dong-joo had been even
five minutes late!

272
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,429
I heard that he asked you to check
her chest and perform an ABGA!

273
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,597
And twice, at that!

274
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,831
Why did you ignore him?

275
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,667
I didn't ignore him...

276
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,956
If you didn't ignore him,

277
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:32,806
were you not aware of her condition
even though a mere intern was?

278
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,387
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,456
Go and apologize 1,000 times
to the patient instead, you idiot!

280
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,247
How dare you be stuffing your face
like this, as if you deserve to be?

281
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,384
This is our first meal of the day,
though!

282
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,819
Geez, he's really too much!

283
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,188
That darned Kang Dong-joo.

284
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,957
Now he's even telling on his seniors?

285
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,741
What do we do about this?
What should we do, Seo-Jung?

286
00:19:58,558 --> 00:19:59,867
Hey, you. Intern.

287
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,437
Are you talking to me?

288
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,816
-Your name is?
-Kang Dong-joo, ma'am.

289
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,727
Yeah, you. Intern.

290
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,476
My name is Kang Dong-joo.

291
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,076
Yeah, your name is Intern.

292
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,219
I saw that you told on me to Dr Park.

293
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,422
All I did was call him to report
the situation since it was an emergency...

294
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:26,172
...since you couldn't be bothered,
with the bleeding patient and all.

295
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,494
So?

296
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,364
The patient with ARDS is fine, then?

297
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,133
Fortunately, she's been stabilized
and has been put in a room.

298
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,202
Geez, amazing.

299
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,352
You even saved a patient's life
when you're a mere intern.

300
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,706
You really did something amazing.

301
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,587
Looks like I'll be able to relax a bit
for the next month, thanks to you.

302
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:43,410
Right?

303
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,642
Well, I'll do my best.

304
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,914
Really?

305
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,716
You all heard him, right?

306
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:52,765
Our intern here said he'll do his best.

307
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,833
From now on, let's have our intern
deal with the MA patients.

308
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,282
What are you talking about?

309
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:03,814
You see, the TMs who come through
our ER are quite delicate.

310
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,734
So this experience will be really helpful
for you to grow as a doctor.

311
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,436
So do your best.

312
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,322
What does she mean by TM?

313
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:23,078
It's an acronym for Trouble-maker.
She means the worst kind of patient.

314
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,563
Worst kind of patient?

315
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:30,757
Hey, miss.
How much is it for two hours of karaoke?

316
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,693
They're there now, I think.

317
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,112
Let me take a quick look at you, sir.

318
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,263
You have quite a deep wound
in your forehead.

319
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,270
Let's disinfect that first with alcohol...

320
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:43,094
What do you mean, disinfect?
Alcohol is for drinking!

321
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,738
You don't even know that
and yet you're a doctor?

322
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,834
Let me disinfect your wounds...

323
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,576
-No!
-Just a moment, sir!

324
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,858
I said I'm not doing it!

325
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:55,332
What's wrong with the doctors
in this country?

326
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,117
Oh, my goodness!

327
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,509
Geez, you pervert!

328
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,824
Hey, you'd better do a good job,
did you hear me?

329
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:07,340
Our boss really hates needles.

330
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:14,657
You have a death wish, don't you?

331
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,117
Well, is it okay?
It's not too hard, is it?

332
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:33,787
Yes, it's not bad.

333
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,975
I heard you were the best of the best,
and you really are a cut above the rest.

334
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,194
So keep doing your best, okay?

335
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,728
And thanks for the coffee.

336
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,708
Seriously!

337
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,213
That's good.

338
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,449
It's an anal foreign body.

339
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,551
I think they were having too much fun
and the object got lodged in there.

340
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:05,452
Take it out for them.

341
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,693
What's in there, exactly?

342
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:10,057
Can't you tell?

343
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:14,361
Um...

344
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,501
About four anal beads
the size of golf balls got in there...

345
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,733
...but they got twisted up or something
and they won't come out.

346
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,486
What?

347
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:23,832
The rest of the string of beads
is coming out of his anus,

348
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:26,139
but some are stuck and the patient
is in excruciating pain.

349
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:29,076
Thankfully, there's no free air
in there, according to the x-rays.

350
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,612
Oh, yeah. Have you eaten?

351
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:36,200
Well, it can't be helped either way.
Take care of it and remove them for him.

352
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:40,112
Wait. How am I supposed to get them out?

353
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,665
Think long and hard about it.

354
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,445
What do you think you'll need
to remove something that's stuck?

355
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:52,085
Hey, aren't you being too tough on him?

356
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,801
Yeah. What if he ends up running away?

357
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:57,304
Well, that can't be helped then.

358
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,864
Sir, please relax!

359
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,709
How am I supposed to relax? It hurts!

360
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:10,601
-There you go!
-One, two!

361
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:15,392
Okay, we're almost done now!

362
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,605
-Breathe! One, two!
-Happy thoughts!

363
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,632
You really are a doctor, huh?

364
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:38,956
I got everything out.

365
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,011
The patient was screaming
quite loudly, though.

366
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,383
He got some anal fissures.

367
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,228
Are you sure he didn't tear
his sphincter too?

368
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:49,356
I did a thorough examination
and thankfully it's not too bad.

369
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,592
What a relief! Good job, Intern.

370
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,493
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?

371
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,795
What are you talking about?

372
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:58,031
You're giving me the worst patients
on purpose to piss me off.

373
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:02,302
-Am I wrong?
-Geez, stop talking nonsense.

374
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,338
I didn't do anything.

375
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,215
Are you discriminating
because they're bad patients?

376
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:09,315
No, I'm complaining
because you're being ridiculous.

377
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:14,014
Hey, Intern.

378
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,531
How do you put an elephant
in a refrigerator?

379
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:18,252
What?

380
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:21,467
The answer is get the intern to do it.

381
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:25,612
Here, interns have to do
whatever the heck we tell them to.

382
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,763
And you can't discriminate
against patients and refuse to see them.

383
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,315
That goes for patients...

384
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,533
...who have shoved worse things
up their butts than just golf balls too.

385
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,549
You understood?

386
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,438
And if you can't handle it, leave.

387
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,010
I won't beg you to stay.

388
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:44,244
What did I do so wrong?

389
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,132
While you put on a show
with that bleeding patient,

390
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,650
I got someone to see a patient with ARDS
who got here before that guy.

391
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,778
Was that so wrong of me?

392
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,158
What did you just say?

393
00:25:58,659 --> 00:25:59,686
"Put on a show?"

394
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:02,011
You do all that so that you can be
called things like...

395
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,498
"Crazy Whale" and "The Queen of
the Index Finger," don't you?

396
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,860
You have a big ego, but you're still
so thirsty for others' acknowledgement.

397
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:13,763
The medical term for that
is histrionic personality disorder.

398
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,741
Am I wrong?

399
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,551
And the medical term for what you have
is narcissistic personality disorder.

400
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:22,355
You're a darn psycho
who thinks he's great and has no respect!

401
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:24,818
What did you just say?

402
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:42,633
What? "Darn psycho?"

403
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:46,640
"Histrionic personality disorder?"
That crazy little...

404
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:05,993
He never acknowledges me.

405
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,399
Thirsty for acknowledgement, huh?

406
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:15,931
Maybe he was right.

407
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,106
Geez!

408
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,474
Wait, really?

409
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,942
Geez!

410
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,912
They even cried!

411
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:33,107
Hurry up and eat.

412
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,395
You don't even have friends to eat with?

413
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:48,001
What about a girlfriend? Do you have one?

414
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,338
No. I don't have time.

415
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,411
What do you even live for then?
How boring.

416
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,262
You have no friends and no girlfriend.

417
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:05,217
That's probably why you were at the top
of your class for five years straight.

418
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,954
While acting all high and mighty too.

419
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,488
Right?

420
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:14,828
At the ER, it's not about
who got there first.

421
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,209
It's about who needs help more.

422
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:22,872
That day, I thought that the pneumonia
patient wasn't in critical condition.

423
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:27,830
So the issue was with my judgment.

424
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:30,878
I didn't ignore her
so I could put on a show.

425
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:32,579
You understood, Intern?

426
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,783
Thanks for the drink.

427
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,434
For the coffee I got from you last time.

428
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:55,896
I'm repaying you for that.

429
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,043
You were with him, weren't you?

430
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,878
Get over here already.

431
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,700
-What is it?
-You surprised me.

432
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:17,552
Are you teaching him a lesson,
or low-key flirting with him?

433
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,328
He may be a jerk, but he does
pretty admirable things.

434
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,063
Admirable, huh?

435
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,565
Even though he said
that you were hysteric?

436
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,902
Look how well he's enduring
even though he literally got crapped on.

437
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,104
There aren't a lot of people like that
among our interns nowadays.

438
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:36,043
Oh, geez.
You practically have hearts in your eyes.

439
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,011
Say what now?

440
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:41,448
I've had a fever since this morning.

441
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:43,851
And I feel kind of blocked up inside.

442
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,319
It feels like there's a weight inside
of me.

443
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,190
Should I get Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

444
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,460
I'll do some preliminary checks first.

445
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,262
I'll take your temperature
and do a chest X-ray.

446
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,997
Okay.

447
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,466
Please get him an ECG as well.

448
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,995
She's not trying to spite you.

449
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,242
I mean, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

450
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,511
I know her well
since I've worked with her for a while.

451
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:13,814
She's just showing her interest
and affection toward you since you're good.

452
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:18,952
Her nickname is "Crazy Whale," but she's
actually quite a tenderhearted whale.

453
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:21,286
I'll get the ECG ready.

454
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:28,993
Oh! Oh, no! Honey!

455
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:33,542
Honey...

456
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:34,968
What happened? What's wrong with him?

457
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,204
He has no pulse.
I think he's going into cardiac arrest.

458
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:39,710
-Patient!
-Doctor, perform CPR!

459
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,775
Yes.

460
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,088
Call Dr Yoon Seo-Jung! Quickly!

461
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,101
What's going on? What happened to him?

462
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:56,076
The patient had a fever
but suddenly went into cardiac arrest!

463
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,090
Fever?

464
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:58,770
Maybe it's myocarditis?

465
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:02,256
How long has he been in arrest?

466
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,741
A bit over a minute now.

467
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,464
Shall I call the thoracic surgery specialist?

468
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,934
He's at an all-staff dinner tonight!

469
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,432
It'll take him at least 30 minutes!

470
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,939
Please prepare the defibrillator
and intubation for me.

471
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,145
And get the AP for me
within three minutes.

472
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:14,641
-Quickly.
-Yes, ma'am.

473
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:22,882
What are you doing? Do it harder!

474
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:26,017
Hey.

475
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:28,188
Move. Go over there.

476
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,431
Where's the defibrillator?

477
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,634
Let's give him ventricular fibrillation.

478
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,102
Charge it up, please.

479
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:48,809
Move back.

480
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:50,676
Go!

481
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:01,246
One more time. 200 joules!

482
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,107
Move back.

483
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,260
Go!

484
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:13,458
Let me see.

485
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,670
I'll check his pulse!

486
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,407
PEA compression!

487
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,344
This won't do.

488
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,180
It's not working, Doctor.

489
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,648
How many minutes has it been?

490
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:29,618
Four minutes and 30 seconds.

491
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:53,440
I'll do it.

492
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:10,469
Let's bring ECMO.

493
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,029
Are you out of your mind?

494
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,065
The chief doctor isn't even here!

495
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:19,933
I've called the thoracic surgery specialist.

496
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,802
I think it'd be best for us to wait
until he gets here.

497
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,105
If a younger man has a fever
and then goes into cardiac arrest...

498
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,040
...there's a high chance
that it's myocarditis.

499
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,976
We can save him
through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

500
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,678
If we wait any longer, we'll lose him!

501
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:33,914
It won't be of any use even if we get
his heart beating again then!

502
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:34,965
So hurry and get the ECMO machine!

503
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,817
But if something goes wrong
while you do that, you...

504
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:39,386
...you'll be blamed for all of this,
Dr Yoon!

505
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,329
Didn't you hear me? Get the ECMO machine!

506
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,192
What happened last time
with that artery was due to sheer luck.

507
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,739
You said so yourself that it only worked
because you got lucky!

508
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,121
You're not going to get lucky
like that all the time.

509
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,736
Let's just do CPR, okay?

510
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,609
Let's try it for 10 minutes.

511
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:56,503
And if it doesn't work,
it can't be helped. Okay?

512
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,863
How do you think you'd feel then?

513
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,474
How do you think you'd feel
if you were lying here...

514
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,143
...but the doctor in charge of you
was saying stuff like "it can't be helped?"

515
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,678
How do you think you'd feel then?

516
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:07,014
That's not the problem right now, though.

517
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,416
If something goes wrong,
you could cause medical accident!

518
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:13,016
I agree with that doctor, Dr Yoon.
Please wait.

519
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:16,223
Are you all really going to be like this?

520
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,091
I said that I'll take responsibility!

521
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,726
So go and bring it, right now!

522
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:22,976
Oh, darn it!

523
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,941
I brought the ECMO machine.

524
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,143
Hey, are you out of your mind?

525
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,398
You should be trying to stop her,
not enabling her!

526
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,533
Okay. Let's move the patient
to the hybrid room.

527
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:51,647
Are you confident that you can do this?

528
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,260
This was covered
in my clinical skills class last term.

529
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,395
I assisted at least 10 times per month.

530
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,097
One false move and he'll die.

531
00:34:58,237 --> 00:34:59,533
Compression please, A-Ra.

532
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,327
You're driving me crazy!

533
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:05,672
Let's begin.

534
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,673
Get the probe.

535
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,322
Wire.

536
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:25,416
Blade.

537
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:30,975
Forceps.

538
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,073
Dilator.

539
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,680
12 cm wire.

540
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:48,849
24 cm wire.

541
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,552
Close it.

542
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,321
Tube.

543
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:01,944
Get the wire.

544
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,235
Tie.

545
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,608
Cut.

546
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:17,869
Cut.

547
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,284
Turn the dial now.

548
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,594
Oh, we did it!

549
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,137
What's the patient's name?

550
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:57,551
Mr Lee Myung-woo.

551
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:04,124
Mr Lee Myung-woo.

552
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:06,293
You can hear my voice, right?

553
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,430
I'm Yoon Seo-Jung who performed
the surgery on you just now.

554
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,440
We're oxygenating your blood now.

555
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:16,303
I have no doubts that you'll be okay.

556
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,472
You have to hold on
until the very end, okay?

557
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:46,624
Okay, then.

558
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:48,744
Monitor his progress
and give me a call back.

559
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,773
What are you doing over there, Dr Moon?

560
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,338
Sit down and eat!

561
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,351
How long has this been running?

562
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:05,886
About 30 minutes.

563
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,221
The patient is fine too.

564
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:09,156
Call me if anything happens.

565
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:10,357
Yes, sir.

566
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:13,843
You, come with me.

567
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,033
Hey, are you out of your mind? Huh?

568
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,337
Who the heck do you think you are,
getting the ECMO?

569
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:25,739
Who's supposed to take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

570
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,109
The surgery went well
and the patient is still holding on.

571
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:33,881
Hey. If you're working in the ER,
just focus on ER-related things.

572
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,450
If you want the right to decide whether...

573
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,519
...or not patients get the ECMO
go and get a specialist's license!

574
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:42,222
He was dying, so we weren't
in a situation to be arguing about that.

575
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:47,127
At any rate, don't think that you'll be able
to get off the hook easily for this.

576
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,762
Prepare yourself.

577
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:17,991
It's okay.

578
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,194
It's okay!

579
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,363
You saved him. That's all that matters.

580
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,835
You did the right thing.

581
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:31,171
You did the right thing, Yoon Seo-Jung.

582
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,431
What is it?

583
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:03,370
I'm sorry. This is all because of me.

584
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:08,250
It's due to my own shortcomings.

585
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:12,925
I was a mess when I had to step up
and I acknowledge that I came up short...

586
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:15,537
...when I had to deal with the real thing.

587
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,786
Oh, stop. It's fine.

588
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:26,803
At any rate, the patient survived
and we did what we needed to do.

589
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:31,798
I can write a 1,000 page long letter
of apology if they want.

590
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,667
So don't be scared.

591
00:40:37,162 --> 00:40:39,406
You weren't that bad either.

592
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,843
Your assisting skills were great.

593
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:45,812
Really?

594
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:51,084
Looks like you managed to get one of
the elephant's feet into the refrigerator.

595
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,720
Good job, Intern.

596
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,353
What are you doing?

597
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,426
Are you out of your mind?

598
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,696
Am I not allowed?

599
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:42,706
Am I not allowed to fall
heads over heels for you?

600
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:35,368
You're crazy.

601
00:42:41,986 --> 00:42:43,262
Hey!

602
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,965
I have a boyfriend, you know!

603
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,267
I have someone I'm seeing already!

604
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:49,336
How dare you?

605
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:11,387
Crazy little brat... I can't believe him.

606
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:12,693
Seriously!

607
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:18,098
He's crazy!

608
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:20,801
Are you leaving?

609
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:21,935
Crazy. Crazy.

610
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,170
Oh, yeah.

611
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,798
Dr Moon is here.

612
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:22,162
About what happened before,
that was just an accident.

613
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,564
You know that, right?

614
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,199
An accident?

615
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:26,767
Well, you know...

616
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:32,339
We just saved a patient on the brink
of death, so...

617
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:33,560
So...

618
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:36,376
you and I were just really emotional,
is all.

619
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:39,379
There was an overproduction
of hormones in me at that moment

620
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:42,823
and I couldn't react properly,
so regarding what happened...

621
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:47,821
...I froze up for a moment
and couldn't react.

622
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:50,057
What do you mean?

623
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:54,361
I'm just saying that it didn't mean anything.

624
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:55,629
You understood?

625
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:58,665
For me, it was since that time...

626
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:06,273
...since that time you found
that patient's artery and held it down.

627
00:45:06,814 --> 00:45:11,084
You were clinging on to that patient's bed
and heading to the OR.

628
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,992
I thought you looked so cool then.

629
00:45:18,446 --> 00:45:20,721
Didn't you hear what I said?

630
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,023
I told you that I'm seeing someone.

631
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:25,225
I want to date you.

632
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:29,062
I told you that I'm seeing someone
and we're in a serious relationship!

633
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:31,365
And I want to sleep with you.

634
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,310
What?

635
00:45:37,622 --> 00:45:39,039
What did you just say?

636
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:40,407
I like you, Senior.

637
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:44,590
I want to sleep with you.

638
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,434
That's him.

639
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:12,082
He's the one I'm dating.

640
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:20,080
I'm leaving now.

641
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:12,799
What are you thinking about?

642
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:20,307
Is this the finger that blocked off
the artery?

643
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:22,302
Yes.

644
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,700
This is your last year
as a medical resident, right?

645
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:49,736
Let's get married
as soon as your residency is over.

646
00:47:51,554 --> 00:47:52,773
Doctor.

647
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,509
Let's do that.

648
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:32,179
Yes, this is the ER.

649
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:35,616
What? What is it?

650
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,383
Yes, I understand.

651
00:48:40,006 --> 00:48:41,655
It's Dr Moon from the surgical department.

652
00:48:42,112 --> 00:48:44,870
There's been a traffic accident
and Dr Yoon Seo-Jung is in the ICU!

653
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:56,970
Dr Yoon!

654
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:58,018
Her BP is bad.

655
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:00,207
She hit the right side of her head
and she's fractured the right side of her...

656
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:01,875
...skull as well as her right arm
so get her X-rayed first.

657
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,877
And make the necessary arrangements
to run tests on her.

658
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:04,912
Yes, sir.

659
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:06,647
Over here.

660
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:08,882
Get her hooked up!

661
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:39,746
Jelly.

662
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,960
It's a hemoperitoneum.

663
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:54,995
Get her up to the OR
as soon as her CT scan is done.

664
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,249
I'll operate on her myself.

665
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,766
And we have to take care of her right arm
and her fractures at the same time...

666
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,277
...so call Orthopedic and see
if we can do a combined operation.

667
00:50:05,237 --> 00:50:06,874
Why aren't you saying anything?

668
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:15,970
Did you drink?

669
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,758
I'll call someone else
to handle the operation.

670
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,360
-Let's get her a CT scan first.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:55,255
Dr Moon?

672
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:02,229
I'm not Dr Moon.
I'm just that jerk intern.

673
00:51:03,286 --> 00:51:05,499
We're on our way to get a CT scan
done on you now.

674
00:51:07,058 --> 00:51:08,429
Where's Dr Moon?

675
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,166
He's in the ER.

676
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:17,811
He hasn't shed a drop of blood
and is completely fine.

677
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,378
So don't worry about him.

678
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:22,049
Go down there and check on Dr Moon first.

679
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:23,283
Are you out of your mind?

680
00:51:24,273 --> 00:51:25,953
You're the one in critical condition
right now.

681
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:28,188
It wasn't me, but him.

682
00:51:29,946 --> 00:51:31,884
He's the one who hit his head.

683
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,102
What are you doing?
I told you, hurry up and go!

684
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,149
-Dr Yoon...
-Kang Dong-joo!

685
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,945
Please.

686
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:55,094
Go to Dr Moon.

687
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:59,920
Please?

688
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:51,976
What is going on?

689
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,616
What happened with Dr Yoon?

690
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,719
Kang Dong-joo. Kang Dong-joo!

691
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:07,387
That jerk.

692
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:08,879
Kang Dong-joo!

693
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:14,164
Oh, Mr Tae-hwa! Mr Tae-hwa! Mr Tae-hwa!

694
00:53:20,065 --> 00:53:22,135
Mr Moon Tae-hwa! Mr Moon Tae-hwa!

695
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:25,439
What do I do? He's not breathing!

696
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:26,982
He's not breathing!

697
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,345
It's not me, but him.

698
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:34,314
He's the one who hit his head.

699
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,920
What do we do? What do we do?

700
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:41,121
Mr Moon Tae-hwa!

701
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:43,457
Mr Tae-hwa!

702
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:38,645
It was a blood hemorrhage
due to trauma from a car accident.

703
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:53,565
Dr Yoon.

704
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,401
Dr Yoon, what's wrong?

705
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:38,205
Was my proposal too sudden?

706
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,674
In fact...

707
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:45,488
...I received a confession today.

708
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:49,616
Was it that fellow from before,
by any chance?

709
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,052
But...

710
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:59,081
...I was a bit swayed by that, Doctor.

711
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:03,997
I'm sorry.

712
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:14,033
Doctor!

713
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:05,826
She's not picking up?

714
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,795
Her phone is off.

715
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:13,100
She should've told us
where she was going, at least!

716
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,368
She's making me so worried!

717
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,370
Can't we call her family, or something?

718
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,673
She doesn't have anyone
like that we can contact.

719
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,941
What do you mean?

720
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,676
Doesn't she have parents?

721
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:25,345
No. She doesn't have any family
or relatives.

722
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:26,914
She's completely alone in this world.

723
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,382
I didn't know that.

724
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:31,018
Where could she have gone?

725
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,370
I like you, Dr Yoon.

726
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:53,640
Crazy little brat...

727
00:58:35,582 --> 00:58:38,385
So she's still somewhat conscious.

728
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:44,191
Geez, she must be out of her mind, huh?

729
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,926
Who are you?

730
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:49,997
How could she think of hiking up
a mountain in her current state?

731
00:58:50,835 --> 00:58:52,199
Is he a pervert?

732
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:57,213
Oh, your hip seems fine.

733
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:07,114
So it's your leg, of all things.

734
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,484
Geez. It's completely busted.

735
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,854
I can't leave her behind though.

736
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:21,094
Okay. Let's get your ankle realigned first.

737
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:34,842
It's going to hurt a bit.

738
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:39,413
One.

739
00:59:40,985 --> 00:59:41,932
Two.

740
00:59:43,728 --> 00:59:44,751
Three!

741
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,896
But what do I do with her now?

742
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,387
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

743
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:23,590
You should've been prepared for that much
if you were going to take the chance.

744
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,126
Doldam Hospital? Where is this place?

745
01:00:26,193 --> 01:00:27,576
It's a sister hospital in Jung-sun.

746
01:00:27,642 --> 01:00:29,467
Maybe he doesn't really like
our hospital?

747
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:30,931
Are you people crazy?

748
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:33,000
Are you sure you are real doctors?

749
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:35,769
I'm going to escape this wretched hospital
as soon as I can!

750
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:38,839
Since when have you been here?

751
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:39,740
I don't know how long you'll stay at...

752
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:44,645
...Doldam but let's pretend that we're
strangers while you're here, okay?

753
01:00:48,556 --> 01:00:53,672
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
