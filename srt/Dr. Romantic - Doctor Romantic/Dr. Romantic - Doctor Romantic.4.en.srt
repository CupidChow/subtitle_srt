1
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:02,678
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,227
Doctor.

3
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,817
Doctor. Actually, that is...

4
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,734
EPISODE 4

5
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:47,481
Number 10 blade.

6
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,253
I'm the one who asked her for help.

7
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,074
I've never taken care
of a burn patient before.

8
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,074
So that's why I asked her.

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,091
I don't want to hear it.

10
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,019
Give him a tetanus vaccine
and put some salve on him.

11
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,764
-And finish dressing him.
-Yes, sir.

12
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,668
-Doctor.
-Did you contact the burn center?

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,703
Yes, sir.
The helicopter will be here in 25 minutes.

14
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,760
-Doctor Teacher Kim!
-Teacher Kim!

15
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,891
Teacher Kim!

16
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,585
Oh, no!

17
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,706
What am I going to do?

18
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:29,823
Teacher Kim. They're all okay, right?

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,049
Nothing bad is going to happen
to them, right?

20
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:34,566
Geun-soo, let's get your arms
treated first, okay?

21
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:37,286
-Nurse Oh. Dress his arm, please.
-Yes, sir.

22
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:40,205
What about Yong-chul?

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,299
It's not looking good for him right now.

24
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,542
You're going to save him, right?

25
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,781
You've even brought a dead man
back to life before.

26
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:57,466
I've seen you do it so many times!

27
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,227
You'll save Yong-chul, right?

28
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,492
I'm going to do my best.

29
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,453
And then we can have him treated
at the burn center later.

30
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,987
Okay? Let's do that.

31
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,938
Yong-chul...

32
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,373
Please come this way, sir.

33
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,292
Are all of the kitchen staff all right?

34
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,754
Burn wounds may not turn out alright.

35
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,108
They'll also have to deal
with the after-effects of the burns.

36
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,939
The company will be taking care
of the fees related to treating them.

37
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,347
I expected as much.

38
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,235
The chairman would like to see you
once more.

39
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,957
Can you come with us
after you've treated them?

40
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:54,347
As you can see, I'm quite busy right now.

41
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,164
What about tomorrow, then?

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,380
Tell the person who has a problem
to come and see me then.

43
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:03,603
Also, about this...

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,152
I'm going to write up an invoice for this...

45
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,034
...and hand it over to you people
so just be aware of that.

46
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:13,527
Isn't that woman Manager Joo
from the casino?

47
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:19,132
What could possibly be going on
between her and Teacher Kim?

48
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,011
THREE HOURS AGO

49
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,572
A time when money rules.

50
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:30,030
A time in which people exert control
and power over others with money.

51
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,749
The world is overflowing with people
who would do anything for money...

52
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,721
...and people who believe that anything
is possible with enough money.

53
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,758
Seems like it's been quite a while
since you first sat down here, sir.

54
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,748
It's been about two days now.

55
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,972
Oh, Miss. I'll take one.

56
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,541
Thank you.

57
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:04,734
Here you are.
Have something to drink while you play.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,307
Oh, yes.

59
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:11,397
Hey, Mister. Call 911 immediately.

60
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:12,624
We have a stroke patient here.

61
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,604
A stroke?

62
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,058
What are you doing? Hurry and call 911!

63
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:23,025
Call 911.
We have a stroke patient! Hurry!

64
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,060
All right, follow my finger
with your eyes.

65
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,033
Here.

66
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:45,773
Wait. Make sure to give this
to the doctor in charge of him.

67
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,654
-Yes, we will!
-Thank you.

68
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:49,890
Geez.

69
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:56,010
Looks like you've saved yet
another precious life.

70
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:59,658
What's the use of it,

71
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,336
since treating them doesn't benefit me?

72
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:06,310
I just did a huge favor
for someone else's hospital, is all.

73
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,917
Come with me.

74
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,116
The chairman would like to see you.

75
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:40,499
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,117
It was the chairman's orders.

77
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,061
Why is there so much gristle
in this steak?

78
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:10,852
Hey.

79
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,682
Are you that person they call Teacher Kim?

80
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:18,246
I would've come running
if you'd just summoned me normally.

81
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,223
Why did you have to beat me up,
like some thug?

82
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,983
You trashy little...

83
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,541
I heard that you're supposed
to be a doctor...

84
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,561
...and yet you go around taking money
from sick people?

85
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,911
And sometimes from the VIPs
at my casino too.

86
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,847
Well, I steal money as I treat them.

87
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,507
I mean, here you are,
not doing any work at all...

88
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:45,272
...and you're taking every last penny
from people who barely have any.

89
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,975
If I put it that way,

90
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,567
you're definitely trashier than I am.

91
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,689
Are you that skilled?

92
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,557
Let go.

93
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:11,036
Well, I've saved far more people
than I've killed.

94
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,032
I heard that...

95
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,802
...people who are pretty much dead
will be completely healed...

96
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,549
...if you treat them.

97
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,706
It's not like I'm Jesus.

98
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:25,316
How could I save a dead person, sir?

99
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:27,711
People with a good chance of living
will survive...

100
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:30,307
...and those who were going to die anyway
will just end up dying.

101
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,420
Come work for me. Okay?

102
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,357
Be my private doctor
instead of going around the casino...

103
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,950
...stealing money from people.

104
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,157
As for money,
I'll give you any amount you want.

105
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,700
And how much is that exactly?

106
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:52,078
Hey, tell them to bring me another steak.

107
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,930
This isn't nearly enough food.

108
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,243
Yes, Chairman.

109
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,118
This is the kitchen, right?

110
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:00,314
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,717
All right!
The chairman has ordered another steak!

112
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,918
-Get a pan!
-Yes, sir!

113
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,286
-And you, go get the meat.
-Yes, sir!

114
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,021
-Bring Fillet Mignon.
-Yes, sir!

115
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,660
What is it? What's the matter?

116
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:15,062
No, it's nothing, sir.

117
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,431
Man, this thing is acting up again.

118
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,478
Yong-chul!

119
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:33,376
How much money do you have in total,
Mr Chairman?

120
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,478
Maybe around one billion dollars?

121
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:40,787
If you give me all of that,
I'll give it some thought.

122
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,718
But I can't settle for any less
than that, Mr Chairman.

123
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,764
I value myself quite highly, you see.

124
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,658
Well, if you're done conducting
your business with me...

125
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,338
...I'll get going now.

126
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,158
It's Friday night, after all.
I should be having fun!

127
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:06,071
Big trouble, Manager!
There's a fire in the kitchen!

128
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,019
What?

129
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,326
Hey, what are you doing?
Get the fire extinguisher!

130
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,262
Oh, Teacher Kim!

131
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:22,403
Geun-soo!

132
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,194
Yong-chul!

133
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:26,922
Yong-chul!

134
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,964
CHAPTER 4
A Necessary and Sufficient Condition

135
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,791
Don't worry! It'll be okay!

136
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,385
Hurry and get on.

137
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,153
AIR AMBULANCE

138
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:04,298
Make sure you're careful now, sir.

139
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,276
The exit is this way.

140
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:11,878
Nurse Park.

141
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,872
These two people will be sent to the burn
center tomorrow via ambulance too.

142
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,788
Take care of them in the ICU until then.

143
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:19,947
Yes, sir.

144
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,264
I have something to tell you.

145
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,499
It's about Dr Yoon.

146
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,370
I said this to you before too,
but it's not her fault.

147
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,571
I asked her for help.

148
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,073
Because I had no experience
treating burn victims.

149
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,544
I have nothing to discuss with you
regarding Yoon Seo-Jung.

150
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,008
Go and take care of your own business.

151
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,603
What was I supposed to do then?

152
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,460
Was I supposed to fumble around
because I didn't know what I was doing...

153
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,129
...and then declare them dead
due to my own lack of knowledge?

154
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,964
The only EM specialist
we have at this lousy hospital...

155
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,332
...is Senior Seo-Jung.

156
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:17,115
Was I supposed to just sit and do nothing
just because of what you said?

157
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,417
No, that's not right.

158
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,587
I was supposed to do everything I could.
The patient was in critical condition.

159
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,598
That's so funny!

160
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,931
What did you say?

161
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:29,763
Hey.

162
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,274
It looks like you think
it was a heroic decision...

163
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,435
...for you to have dragged
Yoon Seo-Jung in here...

164
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:38,216
...just because of a patient
in critical condition or something.

165
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,260
Don't make me laugh.

166
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:43,073
You're just a coward
who can't think on his feet.

167
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,201
Look at you, mouthing off again.

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,210
Did you just call me a coward?

169
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,922
The fact that you tried so hard to get
the highest score in the nation...

170
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,953
...on the board exam makes it obvious.

171
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,177
The reason that you're clinging
so desperately to Geosan Hospital's name...

172
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,379
...is because of that too, isn't it?

173
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,449
Because your inadequacy would be exposed...

174
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,615
...if you didn't rest on those laurels.

175
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,238
Are... Are you done?

176
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,393
Why, are you pissed?

177
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,431
Then don't ever put on airs
in front of me again.

178
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:18,966
Acting as if you're the best,

179
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,774
or as if you know everything
or as if you're a righteous doctor.

180
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,659
Acting like you did something amazing
when you only did what you should have.

181
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,478
I've never acted like that.

182
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,023
Hey,

183
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,279
you didn't drag Dr Yoon in here
because of the patient.

184
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:33,851
You did that for yourself.

185
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,849
You didn't want people to see you
fumbling around...

186
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,681
...in front of a burn victim
since you'd never treated one before.

187
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:40,044
You didn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of the staff again!

188
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,236
You did that and now you're coming here,
pretending to protect Yoon Seo-Jung...

189
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,605
...and acting as if you had no other options,
due to the patient!

190
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,692
What I'm saying is,
stop rattling on and on.

191
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,671
Got that?

192
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,635
Stupid little brat.

193
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,284
Doctor!

194
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,531
What is it now?

195
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,192
Never mind, then, if you have
nothing to say.

196
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,503
Please forgive me just this once, sir!

197
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:27,708
I'll really try my best
if you just give me one more chance, sir!

198
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:29,868
I mean it, sir!

199
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,132
I definitely won't disappoint you!

200
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,336
I can promise you that.

201
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,012
Get up immediately.

202
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,389
No.

203
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,038
I'm not going to move from this spot...

204
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,981
...until you say you'll forgive me.

205
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:42,945
I'll stay right here.

206
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,352
Fine, then.

207
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,486
Coward.

208
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:07,474
Stupid little brat...

209
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:12,312
Kang Dong...

210
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,073
Stay right here.

211
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,711
Don't get involved.

212
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:17,974
Hey, what are you doing?

213
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,797
Stop it now, okay?

214
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,718
What the heck do you know?

215
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:45,078
How dare you talk about me like that,
when you don't know anything about me?

216
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,903
You think you know everything...

217
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,050
...because you're older,
and have lived longer?

218
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,052
You think it's okay...

219
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,130
...you to treat young people
like nobody just because you're old?

220
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,475
No.

221
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,562
You don't know a darn thing about me!

222
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,429
You shouldn't say such things
when you don't even know me as an adult!

223
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,187
That's right!
An adult shouldn't be acting like this!

224
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,775
It's not like I'm more knowledgeable
than you just because I'm older.

225
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,189
And I don't know a thing about you. But!

226
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,512
When you get to my age,

227
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,281
there are some things
that become obvious to you.

228
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,690
Like whether a person is being real
or being fake.

229
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,327
Whether a person will make it or won't.

230
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,430
So are you saying that I'm fake?

231
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,184
Are you saying that I won't make it?

232
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,568
I'm sure you're more aware of that
than I am.

233
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,828
Let go, darn it!

234
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,778
Hey, let go of that guy.

235
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,945
Let go! Let go, darn it!

236
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,436
Calm yourself. This is a hospital.
Stop it, already.

237
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:05,531
I'm going to duke it out
with this guy today!

238
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:12,367
I told you to stop it!

239
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,938
So this is Oh Myung-shim's awakening?

240
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,576
Pardon? Awakening?

241
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,700
It's the moment in which
Myung-shim becomes her sexiest.

242
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:31,270
What are you two doing here right now?

243
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,752
This is a hospital,

244
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,055
and there are patients
in the emergency room right now!

245
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,709
That's what I am saying.

246
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,382
All right, Mr Go.
Get this trash out of here!

247
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:40,790
And you stop it too, Teacher Kim!

248
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,843
Do you know how hard Dr Kang
has been working in the ER today?

249
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,897
He did so well for a young,
inexperienced doctor...

250
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:52,942
...working in this rundown hospital
with our lousy equipment!

251
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,260
He honestly did the best that he
possibly could have in this situation!

252
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,084
You should be praising him.

253
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,951
So why are you being so rude to him?

254
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,898
Especially when you came back
after you got a beating!

255
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:07,082
Hey, Nurse Oh. That may be true, but...

256
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,074
And same goes for the issue
with Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

257
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,921
The director pleaded with you,
and Dr Nam pleaded with you.

258
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:12,826
And furthermore!

259
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,210
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung got on her own knees
and freaking begged you!

260
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:22,088
You shouldn't be so stubborn
and give her another chance!

261
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,144
How could you be so cold?

262
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,611
Dr Yoon has been working with us
at this hospital for so long now.

263
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,180
I didn't know you were like this,
Teacher Kim!

264
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:35,576
Well, about that problem, I was going to...

265
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,650
Knock it off!

266
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,556
Reverse your decision
regarding Dr Yoon Seo-Jung right now.

267
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,747
Come on, Nurse Oh!

268
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:45,471
This issue isn't this simple...

269
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,961
I'll consider that as your consent
for her to rejoin us then.

270
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,566
Teacher Kim!

271
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,114
It's over. He's been knocked out.

272
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,848
What do you mean?

273
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,994
Well, that you'll be safe, probably.

274
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,492
Seriously?

275
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:35,242
Good job.
I look forward to speaking with you.

276
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,353
I saw Dr Jo from Sunyak Hospital...

277
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,158
coming out of the chief
of the surgical department's office.

278
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,912
We can't leave Kang Dong-joo's spot
empty forever after all.

279
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,756
We have tons of patients
that need surgery.

280
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,669
External doctors?

281
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:58,571
Yeah! I just saw two coming out
of interviews with the chief!

282
00:19:58,638 --> 00:19:59,411
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

283
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:01,431
Hey, what are you going to do?

284
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,831
It looks like you're going to get your spot
stolen by someone else.

285
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,143
Hey! Kang Dong-joo, you!

286
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,447
It's over for you now. You got that?

287
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:25,026
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

288
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,049
What are you doing?

289
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,179
Waiting for their disposition instruction.

290
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,036
They're all inside discussing me.

291
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:55,889
Oh, come now!

292
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,374
There isn't anything to think about!

293
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,971
We're so short-staffed as it is.

294
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:05,481
Well, of course,

295
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,787
I do think it's a shame that
this happened with Dr Yoon...

296
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,340
...but I believe that her willpower
will get her through this!

297
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,321
Isn't that right, Director?

298
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,295
What are you going to do?

299
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,348
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

300
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,311
I'm quitting, anyway.

301
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,185
So I can pretty much do or say
whatever I want.

302
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,614
If you're going to quit, quit nicely!

303
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,180
What kind of trouble
are you planning to stir up?

304
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,524
Come in.

305
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,358
Oh, Dr Kang Dong-joo!

306
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,338
We just heard...

307
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:52,028
...how well you handled working
in the ER last night!

308
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,448
You must be tired
from having worked all night.

309
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,317
To what do I owe the pleasure
of seeing you so early in the morning?

310
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,257
What's this?

311
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,039
-It's a letter of resignation.
-What?

312
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,128
-A letter of resignation?
-Dr Kang.

313
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,098
I don't think I'm a suitable fit
for this hospital,

314
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,374
no matter how I look at it.

315
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,402
I feel like I'm too lacking to continue
working here, as well.

316
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,286
Good that you know that.

317
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:18,872
Teacher Kim, please!

318
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,441
You can't, Dr Kang. Please reconsider.

319
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,771
There's so much that
you must do at our hospital.

320
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,643
I completely understand
whatmmay have upset you.

321
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,310
So please, until you return to Geosan,
at least...

322
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,674
I'm actually trying to find employment
at a different hospital.

323
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,591
And a couple of places have said that
they're interested in me.

324
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,396
Good for you.

325
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,531
-So leave, then.
-Teacher Kim!

326
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,533
Teacher Kim, please.

327
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,348
I'm not the type to cling to people
who want to leave.

328
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,618
If you try to hang on to kids like him,
they'll only cause you trouble later.

329
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:55,075
Please, reconsider! You have to.

330
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,849
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused
in such a short amount of time.

331
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:09,823
Oh yeah, also...

332
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:18,465
I get that you're super skilled
and I get that you have a huge ego, but...

333
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,255
...don't go around stating the obvious
as if you did something amazing,

334
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:25,396
...just like you told me.

335
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,307
Yes, you're right.

336
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:36,784
I'm a coward and a stupid one,
just like you said.

337
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:40,262
It's true that I studied my butt off
so I could rely on acing the board exam

338
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,149
and work at a renowned hospital like
Geosan since I'd be scared otherwise!

339
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:46,077
And it's true that I tried to kiss up
so I could get ahead!

340
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,196
And it's true that I've lived
a miserable, ugly life!

341
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,100
But...

342
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:59,640
...those who made the world like this
are miserable people like you!

343
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,185
You made the world
so that people like me, with nothing,

344
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:12,778
would have to live such nasty lives
to get anywhere...

345
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:15,489
...and yet, here you are,
looking down on me...

346
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,214
...and calling me cowardly and idiotic!

347
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,324
Dr Kang.

348
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,952
You don't even know
what it's like to live a righteous life!

349
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,034
So don't try to teach me
how to live a righteous life.

350
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,033
Because quite frankly, it's disgusting.

351
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,582
That's all I have to say.

352
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,585
What are you all doing? Dr Kang!

353
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:52,791
Why are you standing there like that,
like an idiot?

354
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,140
You didn't even do anything that bad.

355
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,898
This hospital isn't that great, anyway!

356
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,101
Any place would be better
than this place.

357
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,937
Want me to find you a spot
at a different hospital too?

358
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,675
Dr Kang Dong-joo. Please calm down first.

359
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,924
Let's try to solve this through dialogue.

360
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,587
Let me know if you change your mind.

361
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,481
It won't be hard to find
a position for you.

362
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,752
Dr Kang Dong-joo! Dr Kang!

363
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,391
What are you going to do now?

364
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,226
I'm not sure.

365
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,862
I don't know what to do.

366
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,538
You can't let your emotions control
your decision-making like this.

367
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,938
Teacher Kim really knows
how to piss someone off, doesn't he?

368
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:41,642
I know. I have a couple of grievances
with him myself too!

369
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,677
But you saw him, right?
He still ignored you!

370
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:46,484
It's not right for you to submit this
just because of one person.

371
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,681
It's not just him!

372
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,544
I just don't like this hospital
as a whole!

373
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,553
Oh, really?

374
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:55,082
What don't you like, exactly?

375
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:58,592
I can't even tell the difference
between the departments

376
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,127
and the nurses are everywhere,
going back and forth...

377
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,762
...from the OR to the ER!

378
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:03,566
There are barely any people,

379
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,669
and it's not even clear
who's in charge of what.

380
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:08,569
Well, that happened
because we're short staffed.

381
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:12,105
And all of us developed
a holistic approach to the hospital...

382
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:13,373
That's why I'm saying
I'll go to a hospital...

383
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,125
...where they'll only ask me to do
what I've specialized in.

384
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:18,345
A big, clean hospital, equipped
with all of the latest technology

385
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,581
where I can treat patients
in a sterile environment.

386
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,682
Of course,

387
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,885
our hospital may pale in comparison
just a bit to city hospitals.

388
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:29,790
It's not "just a bit."
They are a lot better.

389
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,501
The hospital building
is quite old and weathered...

390
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:34,428
and the systems here are quite dated.

391
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:36,697
And the equipment we have here
is totally crappy.

392
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,399
So don't waste any more of your time
in a lousy place like this.

393
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:41,190
Let's head to another hospital.

394
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,704
What, so I can go somewhere else
and live like you do?

395
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,474
Caring more about my superiors' opinions
than my patients...

396
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:51,571
...and wondering whose side to take
so that you can get ahead?

397
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:53,313
If you don't want to do that

398
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,516
you can hole yourself up
in this lousy hospital forever.

399
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,078
So sad!

400
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,172
Dr Yoon!

401
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,623
How is it that you're so great
in many ways

402
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:06,293
and yet you only have such ugly thoughts?

403
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,796
It's because it's hard for me even with
my so-called cleverness and skills!

404
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:12,799
Of course nothing's worked out for you
with that victim mentality of yours!

405
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:13,700
What did you say?

406
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,601
Come, now. Please calm down, both of you.

407
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:18,238
Firstly, I understand
what you're saying, Dr Kang.

408
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,508
I'll discuss this with the director
and come up with solutions.

409
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,311
We'll get you a better salary,
or even a nicer place to live!

410
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:25,846
Why bother?

411
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,548
It's not like he'd be thankful for your
efforts, anyway.

412
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,516
Why are you acting like this, Dr Yoon?

413
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,285
Help me out, here. Please?

414
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:32,819
No thank you, Mr Jang!

415
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,756
It's just as she said. I won't change
my mind just because of that.

416
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:36,790
Dr Kang Dong-joo!

417
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,859
See? I told you. This is how he is.

418
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,260
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

419
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:44,598
Have a nice life forever, then,
at this shoddy excuse for a hospital.

420
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,501
Same to you. And don't worry about me.

421
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,141
Geez!

422
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,409
Dr Kang!

423
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,477
-Please! Just this once!
-Let go of me!

424
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:59,880
-Just this once!
-Let go of me!

425
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,902
What a noisy hospital this is.

426
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:16,704
What are you two men doing
in broad daylight?

427
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,710
Oh, Manager Joo.

428
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:25,999
What brings you here?

429
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,607
Is he your father?

430
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:31,701
He's the chairman.

431
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,429
Nice to meet you, sir.

432
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,756
I'm in charge of administrative affairs
here at Doldam.

433
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:41,734
I'm Jang Gi-tae. I've wanted to meet you.

434
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,181
It looks like I'm finally having
that chance, sir.

435
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:46,261
But does he need any medical attention?

436
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,349
He's here to meet Teacher Kim.

437
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,164
What? Teacher Kim?

438
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,198
These are the candidates for the surgeons...

439
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,366
...who will be doing the chairman
of the board's surgery.

440
00:28:55,432 --> 00:29:00,340
But this surgeon named John Woo
is widely recognized, even in the States.

441
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:07,347
I'd also like to congratulate you
on your third year as director in advance.

442
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,250
Don't get ahead of yourself.

443
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,896
We have two months until that is decided.

444
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,256
I'm not getting ahead of myself.

445
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,693
I'm just saying that it's obvious, sir.

446
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,776
Contact Chief Joo.

447
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:25,742
And say that I'll be going
to Jeongseon myself.

448
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,534
Yes, sir.

449
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,038
What brings you here, sir?

450
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:34,908
I heard that you wanted me
to come here myself.

451
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,077
I had no choice but to concede...

452
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,276
...since it's me who needs you.

453
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:42,883
If you want me to be
your personal doctor...

454
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,223
...I've already told you my conditions.

455
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:02,903
Looks like it's been about two years
since you got that surgery.

456
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,238
That's exactly right.

457
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:10,021
Does it look like the operation
was done well to you?

458
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:16,382
Well, seeing as how you're
still alive now, I'd say yes.

459
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:22,633
I've been living with this hunk
of metal in me...

460
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,288
...for two years.

461
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,762
But in my opinion,

462
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:29,213
I think the battery...

463
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,048
...they put near my stomach is running low.

464
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:36,373
I get so short of breath
even though I'm completely still.

465
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,242
They said I have to live like this
until I get my heart transplant.

466
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:49,606
But who knows when a heart
that matches me will show up?

467
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,536
You've lived this long
and made so much money already.

468
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:58,870
You should be more generous
toward others now.

469
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,027
Who knows?

470
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,864
If you live like that,
the heavens may be touched...

471
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:07,023
...and send you a heart
that's a perfect match.

472
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,571
Even if a heart that's a match for me,
comes and finds me...

473
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,774
...the problem is that...

474
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,259
...I don't have any doctors that I trust.

475
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,407
What about the doctor who put
that artificial heart inside of you?

476
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:22,872
He died.

477
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:24,363
Because of a heart attack.

478
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,566
He was working so hard on an operation...

479
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,402
...to save someone else's heart his heart
ended up failing in that moment, instead.

480
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,992
So he died right there and then.
Isn't that funny?

481
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,394
That's sad.

482
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,832
Will you do it for me?

483
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,256
I heard that you used to be
a cardiothoracic surgeon back in the day.

484
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,461
Why me, of all people?

485
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:50,444
There are tons of other surgeons
who are plenty skilled.

486
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:55,256
Sure, there are tons of doctors
who are skilled.

487
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:58,783
But there aren't too many real people.

488
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:05,425
Are you saying that you think I'm genuine?

489
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:12,443
Do you know how I made all this money?

490
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:17,271
It was all because of my instincts.

491
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,310
My knack for recognizing real people
when I see them.

492
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,613
Well, if that's the case,

493
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,317
I guess your instincts have aged quite
a bit too.

494
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:33,787
What, you don't want to do
the surgery for me?

495
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,423
Because I'm trash?

496
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:52,973
I'm sorry to interrupt
during your conversation.

497
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,309
But I'd like to take some time
to introduce...

498
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,978
...Doldam Hospital's special tea menu
for VIPs.

499
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,814
For black tea, we have Earl Grey,
English breakfast, and Ceylon.

500
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,084
As for green tea, we have Ujeon,
Sejak, Seollok, and so on.

501
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:08,322
You can have them hot or iced,
and milk tea is also available.

502
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,023
What kind of tea would you like?

503
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:31,505
Have you ever thought about me at all?

504
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,110
Did you even miss me?

505
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,932
Can't you hear me?

506
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,453
What's wrong with you?

507
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,400
What?

508
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:51,758
What are you talking about?

509
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,596
Did you say something?

510
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:56,606
I said, did you even miss me?

511
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,872
Did you think about me...

512
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:09,643
...even once these past five years?

513
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,092
I went hiking and got lost.

514
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,229
I ended up slipping and hurt my wrist.

515
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,533
And I was only focused on recovering
for the three years after that.

516
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,370
Thankfully, I got about 90 percent
of my original skill back...

517
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,238
...and was able to pass the EM board exam.

518
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,444
But after that, I wanted to be certified
for cardiothoracic surgery,

519
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:47,648
since most of the people
who come to the ER...

520
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:50,250
...either have heart or lung problems.

521
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,020
So you didn't have a single moment
to think about someone like me.

522
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,057
Right?

523
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,968
I got it.

524
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,039
I've heard your answer loud and clear.

525
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,690
I missed you too.

526
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,086
I have no idea why,

527
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,289
but sometimes, I'd think of you.

528
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,095
You're just throwing me a bone now
that I'm leaving.

529
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,232
Is that what you're trying to do?

530
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,605
Is that what it sounded like to you?

531
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:50,110
There's nothing I can do about that.

532
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,451
TEACHER KIM

533
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,387
I have to go. Bye, then.

534
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,270
Success. Getting ahead.

535
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,039
Having all those things is nice.

536
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,743
But you know, Kang Dong-joo.

537
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:25,779
We're doctors.

538
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,181
So what?

539
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,184
What do you want me to do?

540
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,053
With or without those things,

541
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,789
you're still a doctor.

542
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,827
So don't forget that.

543
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,683
Are you leaving for the day?

544
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:39,520
No. I'm leaving for good.

545
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,490
And you said farewell to the director?

546
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:46,226
I think seeing him when I handed in
my letter of resignation was sufficient.

547
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:49,830
I'm sorry, but...

548
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:54,835
...there's a patient in the ER right now
with a hand laceration.

549
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:58,672
Can you at least stitch it up
before you go?

550
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:04,745
Please.

551
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,817
Where's the patient?

552
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,122
They're awaiting treatment
in the hybrid room.

553
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:32,306
Please say something, sir.

554
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:37,878
I'll accept whatever decision
you've come to.

555
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,313
Well,

556
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:46,253
except telling me to quit.

557
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:56,396
Come here.

558
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:58,866
Pardon?

559
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:01,435
I want to take a look at your hand.
Come over here.

560
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:04,004
Oh, yes.

561
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,336
Does that feel okay?

562
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,039
Yes, it's fine.

563
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:52,991
You're quite good.

564
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:55,230
You would've been great
as a plastic surgeon, too.

565
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,523
Are you teasing me for being so slow?

566
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,860
I'm merely praising you
for doing such a good job.

567
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,999
Why do you hate Doldam Hospital so much?

568
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:12,339
What?

569
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,942
Give me three reasons why...

570
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,911
...you want to stay at this hospital so much.

571
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,989
First of all, I hate that guy they call
"Teacher Kim."

572
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:24,107
I want to learn from you, Doctor.

573
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:26,298
And I don't like this hospital.

574
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:28,569
I want to learn from you, Doctor.

575
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,743
I can't see a future for myself
at this hospital.

576
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,026
I want to...

577
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:37,064
...learn from you, Doctor.

578
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:42,436
It's my dream to perform a surgery...

579
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,572
...with you.

580
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,641
What I want to be is the best doctor.

581
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,610
I'm not trying to be a good doctor.

582
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:51,445
That's why...

583
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:54,291
...this isn't a place for me to be.

584
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:55,749
Is that right?

585
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,060
Let me ask you just one thing, then.

586
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:00,954
Does Teacher Kim seem like...

587
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:05,559
...a good doctor or the best doctor to you?

588
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,647
Which one is it?

589
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,782
Does Teacher Kim seem like...

590
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,554
...a good doctor or the best doctor to you?

591
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:35,689
These doctors are the best of the best.

592
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,257
Please, take a look.

593
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,093
Oh, geez.

594
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:43,063
Looks like I put you
through a lot of grief for nothing.

595
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:44,998
Pardon?

596
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,001
To be honest,

597
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:53,207
I've found a surgeon to do
my procedure for me.

598
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,182
He's quite skilled.

599
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:00,219
Who recommended this person to you,
if I may ask?

600
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,553
Chairman. It's a call from Teacher Kim.

601
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,951
Oh, sure.

602
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:08,121
Yeah, Teacher Kim? Well, how about it?

603
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:10,824
Have you decided?

604
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,834
Firstly, I'll need an ultrasound machine.

605
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:14,958
The newest model.

606
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:19,142
Oh, so you want me to pay with gifts
instead of money for the surgery?

607
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:22,436
No, this is more like a settlement fee.

608
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:30,043
I won't fully recover from the beating
I got yesterday for a few weeks.

609
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:35,261
And as I've told you, I'm quite expensive.

610
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:39,386
Fine, fine.
I'll buy you the newest model.

611
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:43,472
Will you do my surgery for me
if I do that?

612
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,169
If you want to get surgery
to replace your battery,

613
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:51,465
we'll need the best ultrasound machine,
surgery bed, and anesthesia machine.

614
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,867
We'll also need a heart-lung machine.

615
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:58,341
If you're thinking about getting
a heart transplant surgery later as well...

616
00:43:58,408 --> 00:43:59,506
Yes?

617
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:04,378
We'll need an aseptic room
to do immuno-suppression therapy,

618
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:09,426
but those equipment are quite expensive...

619
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:12,786
I don't care how much money it costs.
Don't worry.

620
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:17,858
I'll get you the latest technology
of anything you'll need.

621
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:22,775
So you'll do my surgery, right?

622
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:26,533
I'll schedule a date for you
as soon as the equipment comes in.

623
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,040
You heard, right?

624
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:36,610
Teacher Kim said he'll do my surgery.

625
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,017
That's great, sir.

626
00:44:38,478 --> 00:44:39,379
Chairman.

627
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:45,252
Did I do something to upset you?

628
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,753
What are you talking about?

629
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:51,658
You've been taking good care
of Geosan Hospital for all this time.

630
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:54,609
So why did you ignore
the people that I suggested to you...

631
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:57,464
...and decide to entrust this procedure
to some no-name doctor?

632
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:00,601
Are you curious?

633
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:01,735
I apologize,

634
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,938
but, yes.

635
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,240
I'm quite curious.

636
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:09,142
Manager Joo.

637
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:10,811
Show it to him.

638
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:11,712
Yes, sir.

639
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,322
What do you see?

640
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,057
It looks like a fire, sir.

641
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:25,869
Is this the kitchen at the casino?

642
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:29,630
It's a fire that happened last night.

643
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:33,234
What else do you see?

644
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,502
It seems that the kitchen employees
are badly injured.

645
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,770
Yes.

646
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,305
What else?

647
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:40,974
This person is...

648
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:43,310
That's right.

649
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:45,812
It's him.

650
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,415
This guy who ran in there
like a crazy person...

651
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:51,285
...to try and save these people.

652
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,021
I'm not sure what you mean.

653
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:57,136
With most doctors when someone gets hurt,

654
00:45:57,224 --> 00:46:00,861
they just fix up that part
and end things there.

655
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:05,734
But this guy did his best
to minimize their injuries

656
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:10,169
and even put his life at risk to do it.

657
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,238
This guy...

658
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:16,450
You don't understand
what I'm getting at, here?

659
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:20,147
Well, no. Not really, sir.

660
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,751
This is the guy called Teacher Kim.

661
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:30,390
He's a real doctor
to whom I can entrust my life.

662
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,340
Looks like you finally recognize him now,
Director Do.

663
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:04,191
Yes, exactly. It's that guy.

664
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,698
It's ventricular fibrillation, sir!
Sir. Sir!

665
00:47:15,202 --> 00:47:16,870
Move him to the hybrid room. Hurry.

666
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:18,205
And get a defibrillator too.

667
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,308
And give him one dose of epinephrine
every three minutes.

668
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,509
Yes, sir!

669
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,451
Are you on your way back
from seeing Teacher Kim?

670
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:34,488
Dr Yoon.

671
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,026
What?

672
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,072
What did Teacher Kim say?

673
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,130
Did he say that it'd be okay
for you to stay?

674
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,034
Well...

675
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,803
It's fine to stay at Doldam Hospital,

676
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,371
if that's what you want.

677
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,042
Thank you, Doctor.

678
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,435
I'll never forget your kindness,

679
00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:04,351
and I won't let you down.

680
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:05,752
But...

681
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,257
...I can't allow you
to treat any patients yet.

682
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,894
What am I supposed to do...

683
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:16,663
...if I can't treat patients?

684
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:20,031
Helper.

685
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:21,716
Helper?

686
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:24,409
Yes. Helper.

687
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:29,910
Did you just tell me to do helper work?

688
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:33,419
I need to make sure that
it'll be okay to entrust patients to you.

689
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:38,685
Until you can control yourself
even without your medication.

690
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:43,490
That's all I can trust you to do
for now at this hospital.

691
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:48,095
What, you can't do it?

692
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,232
No, that's not it...

693
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:53,800
Did you say that you'd do it?

694
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,703
I asked him to give me some time
to think about it.

695
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,472
Think about what?

696
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:00,340
You should've been firm
and said you couldn't do it.

697
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,708
Right?

698
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:03,243
Being a helper is a bit...

699
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,178
Really?

700
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:05,646
You can't do it?

701
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:12,419
You can leave at any time

702
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:14,454
if you can't handle it.

703
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:16,190
I won't hold you back.

704
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:18,158
I never said that I couldn't do it, sir.

705
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:20,060
But still, making her helper job
is a bit...

706
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,931
This is me making a very special
exception for Dr Yoon, Nurse Oh.

707
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:25,799
So be aware of that!

708
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,007
Well, he says that's that.

709
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:34,908
I'll be off, then.

710
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:42,616
200 Joules.

711
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,519
Ready, sir.

712
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:47,721
Clear!

713
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:58,131
-What happened?
-It was a traffic accident.

714
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:00,968
He has a hemopneumothorax as well as
some hip dislocation on his right side.

715
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:03,237
They put a chest tube in him
to hydrate him,

716
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:04,671
but he's having a vfib now.

717
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,540
Please, please!

718
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,042
Checking his heart rate now!

719
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:13,347
-One more time. 200 Joules.
-Yes, sir.

720
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,283
Ready, sir.

721
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,020
Clear!

722
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:24,925
How many minutes have elapsed?

723
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,527
About three minutes.

724
00:50:29,296 --> 00:50:32,032
Please!

725
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:35,269
Checking his heart rate.

726
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:39,106
His pulse is back, Doctor!

727
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:46,146
Please take an EKG of him,
and prepare a Cline.

728
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,015
-As for the blood transfusion...
-I thought you were quitting.

729
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:51,785
So why haven't you left yet?

730
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:56,256
He's the last patient
I'll be treating at Doldam Hospital.

731
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:58,492
Did the results of the CT scan come out?

732
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:00,260
He has multiple rib fractures
on his right side...

733
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:01,562
...as well as a hemopneumothorax.

734
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:02,696
We've put a tube in,

735
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:04,031
but there isn't much internal bleeding.

736
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,655
There's slight dislocation
on his right pelvis...

737
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,269
...and the humerus on his left side
has compound fracturing.

738
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:11,338
Have you relocated
a dislocated bone before?

739
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:14,274
No. But I know how to do it.

740
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,275
Want me to get on top?

741
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:16,176
Nurse Park!

742
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:17,611
Sheet.

743
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:28,257
What are you doing?

744
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:29,595
You're not going to tie the other side?

745
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,302
You're going to do it by yourself?

746
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:49,877
Is it finished?

747
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:57,651
It's done, as you can see.

748
00:51:58,272 --> 00:51:59,887
All right. His vitals are okay, right?

749
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,955
-They're stable, sir.
-Okay.

750
00:52:03,023 --> 00:52:04,458
Next, the humerus.

751
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:11,899
Which are you?

752
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:13,634
What do you mean?

753
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,003
Are you a good doctor?

754
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:17,905
Or the best doctor?

755
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,235
Wait, this...

756
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:58,412
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL KANG DONG-JOO

757
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:07,588
I want to hear this from you, yourself.

758
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:11,758
Are you a good doctor,
or the best doctor?

759
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:23,871
If you ask the patient lying here
right now,

760
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,940
which of those two doctors
do you think he'd want?

761
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:29,610
-The best doctor.
-No.

762
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:32,546
He'd want the doctor that he needs.

763
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,886
What this patient desperately needs...

764
00:53:38,986 --> 00:53:41,088
...is an orthopedic surgeon
who can treat his fracture.

765
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,291
That's why I'm doing my best
to use everything that I have...

766
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:48,295
...to become the doctor that
this patient needs right now.

767
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,163
Does that answer your question?

768
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,669
It's fine to blame the system, the world,

769
00:53:56,136 --> 00:53:59,439
and the old farts that made
the world the way it is now.

770
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:00,374
It's fine, but...

771
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:04,444
...the world won't change
just because you blame others.

772
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:08,715
Even if you do,

773
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:11,985
they won't remember
a single syllable of your name.

774
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:18,926
If you really want to win against them,

775
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:20,861
become someone who is needed.

776
00:54:21,395 --> 00:54:23,597
Don't blame others,
and do it through your own skill!

777
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:30,604
If you don't change,

778
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:32,806
nothing else will.

779
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:34,675
Got that?

780
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:38,779
If you don't change,

781
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,649
nothing else will.

782
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:48,155
Okay. That's all from me.

783
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:53,227
Finish treating your last patient
at Doldam Hospital now.

784
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:03,403
No way.

785
00:55:07,908 --> 00:55:09,009
Is it him?

786
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:12,679
Dr Kang!

787
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:15,453
He'll be back.

788
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,884
So let's just wait, shall we?

789
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:33,367
TO BU YONG-JU

790
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,135
Doctor!

791
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:36,803
What?

792
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,872
You still have business with me?

793
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:41,775
It's you, isn't it?

794
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:44,511
The person from back then.

795
00:55:49,082 --> 00:55:50,017
You are, aren't you?

796
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,554
Dr Bu Yong-ju.

797
00:56:00,594 --> 00:56:01,862
Is it really him?

798
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:08,235
Is Teacher Kim of Doldam Hospital
that jerk Bu Yong-ju?

799
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:10,003
I don't know.

800
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,305
Look here, Director Yeo!

801
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:15,709
I don't know any other names
that refer to Teacher Kim.

802
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,712
So I can't confirm this for you.

803
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,447
Hey, you punk!

804
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:21,949
Answer me properly, now!

805
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:27,354
Sadly, there's nothing more that
I can tell you, Director Do.

806
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:28,822
Goodbye.

807
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:37,798
Look at these little brats...

808
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:43,770
So you're going to go and stab
my back like this, huh?

809
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:52,513
Please answer me.

810
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:54,815
Dr Bu Yong-ju.

811
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:00,120
It's you, right?

812
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:02,923
Right?

813
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:16,937
Hey, you're an idiot, aren't you?

814
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:19,773
I've already told you who I am.

815
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,308
What kind of nonsense are you
spouting now?

816
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:28,124
Teacher Kim.

817
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,483
I'm Dr Teacher Kim.

818
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,519
I don't have any other names
besides that one.

819
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,987
Satisfied now?

820
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:39,693
To Dr Bu Yong-ju.

821
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:43,363
My name is Kang Dong-joo.

822
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:47,334
I want to grow up to be a good doctor,

823
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,637
just like you.

824
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:54,541
Excuse me.

825
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:57,728
Where should I go if I want to meet
Dr Bu Yong-ju?

826
00:57:57,795 --> 00:57:58,879
Dr Bu Yong-ju?

827
00:57:59,546 --> 00:58:01,682
He quit.

828
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:04,284
He quit?

829
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:09,903
Then where I could go to see him?

830
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,291
I'm not too sure, either.

831
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:12,993
Just a second.

832
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,462
Yes, this is the courtesy desk
at Geosan University Hospital.

833
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,564
Yes.

834
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,143
I want to make it
so that there aren't ever patients

835
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:34,948
who are treated unfairly ever again,
just like my father was.

836
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:42,656
There's no doubt about it.

837
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:45,893
He's Dr Bu Yong-ju.

838
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:50,531
It's him.

839
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,246
Didn't you say that you were quitting?

840
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:07,714
Didn't you say that you missed me?

841
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,184
Do you even know why he was kicked
out of Geosan Hospital?

842
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,652
There must be a reason...

843
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,220
...and some pain related to the fact
that a great man like him...

844
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:16,657
...has thrown his name away
and is hiding in such a place.

845
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:17,558
It's because he killed someone.

846
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:19,826
And it was one of his disciples,
of all people!

847
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:20,827
It's been a while.

848
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:21,762
Hey, Do In-bum!

849
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:23,597
Of course there is a picture that
I want to draw.

850
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:25,199
And what may that be?

851
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:29,369
May I ask you the reason why
you wanted me to stay here?
