EPISODE 11

2
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,646
STUDENT ID: JANG HYUN-JOO
Geosan University. Medical school.

3
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,485
Jang Hyun-joo?

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,054
What are you doing there?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,517
Teacher Kim.

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,730
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,757
The door was open, so I just came in...

8
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,733
What do you think about Bu Yong-joo?

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,010
Do you think that he's a good person?

10
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,860
Get out.

11
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,360
Doctor.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,819
I want to know why

13
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,651
you're asking me such things.

14
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,773
I thought I'd have to know that

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,338
before trying to win you over.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,188
Well?

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,566
What do you think about working for me?

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,556
Get out!

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,870
Um...

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,488
I'm confused...

21
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,140
It wasn't long ago that you kicked
me out of the hospital.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,870
Think of that as a test for me to see

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,610
whether or not you had potential.

24
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,080
At my age...

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,880
there's something that
becomes clear to you.

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,442
Something like whether or not
someone is fake.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,273
And whether someone has potential or not.

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,065
So...do I seem as if I have potential
to you, Director Do?

29
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,137
I'll increase your yearly salary by

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,140
15 percent and add an additional
100,000 dollars per year for your research.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,410
I was thinking of starting there.

32
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,403
This is all so unexpected that

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,090
it's making me uncomfortable.

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,420
I'll give you a proper look
at how different

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,913
it is to be one of my men.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,950
No matter what you may want,

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,420
you'll receive far more than that.

38
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,997
I don't think you'd just be giving
all that to me for free.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,870
So what is it that you want
from me in exchange?

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,240
Bu Yong-joo.

41
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
That little brat...

42
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,710
He has been entrusted with
the chairman's surgery.

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,368
And it's really grating on my nerves.

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,224
Are you worried about

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,363
the fame and glory that
Teacher Kim will get

46
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,300
after he successfully
completes the surgery?

47
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,620
Even if he ends up doing
the chairman's surgery...

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,030
he mustn't succeed.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
What do you mean by that?

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,762
Come on, I know you're plenty smart.

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,370
So why did you do that?

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,550
Why did you go into
someone else's empty office?

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
It was because I saw that Chief Jang

54
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,182
was emptying only Teacher Kim's
trash bin.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,591
So I went in there out of curiosity.

56
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,907
Chief Jang was?

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,820
I was happy to no longer be a helper

58
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,990
but it looks like I'll end up
on his black list again.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,356
What should I do, Nurse Oh?

60
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,765
What should you do?

61
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,626
If your luck is that bad, it's clear that
it's your fate to be on his bad side.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,995
I think that it must be because of
that student ID.

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
What student ID?

64
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,852
I found the student ID of someone
named Jang Hyun-joo.

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,227
And I think he's mad because of that.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,902
Do you know anything about
this, Nurse Oh?

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,840
It said that she was a student at
Geosan and was in the class of '04.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,410
I don't know anything about it if

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,123
it happened at Geosan Hospital.

70
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,230
I first met Teacher Kim in the
winter of 2002.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,760
The year Korea hosted the World Cup.
And that was before that, so...

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,850
I see.

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,490
Oh, wait. There is someone.

74
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,140
What do you mean?

75
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,960
There's someone who may know
who Jang Hyun-joo is.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,571
Jang Hyun-joo?

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,510
You were originally in
the class of '05, right?

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,810
Even though you interned with us
since you were two years behind.

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,690
Hey, do you really need to say
that I flunked for 2 years?

80
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,050
Do you know this Jang Hyun-joo or not?

81
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,229
I do know her.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,420
I do, but...

83
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,287
So?

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,036
When she was a second or third year,

85
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,848
I heard she died.

86
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,839
While having surgery for a liver abscess.

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,560
Student ID card: Jang Hyun-joo

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,460
Mister!

89
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,030
Do you know Dr Bu Yong-joo,
by any chance?

90
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,443
The age in which the truth is concealed.

91
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,690
If you want,

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,060
I can make you the second Bu Yong-joo.

93
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,590
The age in which truth submits to

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,900
power and lies run amok.

95
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,671
"Surgery success rate, 97 percent."

96
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,080
Bu Yong-joo didn't create that legend

97
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,548
but I did.

98
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,340
How is that even possible?

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,380
That's a matter of life and death.

100
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,380
I just found a great marketing
point appropriate for the time, is all.

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,150
"God's Hand."

102
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,239
I came up with that, too.

103
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,890
And I can build you up to become
someone like that, too.

104
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,730
Groundless rumors and a plethora

105
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,804
of tales have piled up

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,740
while the truth has been forced
to take a back seat.

107
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,460
So make up your mind.

108
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,100
And it has become hard to tell...

109
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,050
I'll take care of the rest.

110
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,920
I don't even know what real is and
what fake is.

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,844
Such is the world we live in now.

112
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,630
Do you know who performed that
liver abscess surgery, by any chance?

113
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,847
No, I don't.
I wasn't super close to her or anything.

114
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,573
It probably

115
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,370
wasn't Teacher Kim, right?

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,418
Oh, no way!

117
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,024
Right?

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,920
Wait a second.

119
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,225
That's not entirely impossible.

120
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,623
Chief Song said that

121
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,540
Bu Yong-joo was kicked out because he
killed someone.

122
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,092
And I think he said that he killed his
disciple, too.

123
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,296
Killed his disciple?

124
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,378
Wait, wait!

125
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,407
'04...

126
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,530
I think that Jang Hyun-joo died around

127
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,854
the same time Bu Yong-joo was kicked out.

128
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,124
Maybe the disciple he killed was

129
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,627
Jang Hyun-joo?

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,613
Wow! This is freaking me out.

131
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,660
Hey, I'm totally freaked out right now.

132
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,260
Where's the effusion patient?

133
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,980
The effusion patient.

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,640
In the hybrid room, sir!

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,840
EPISODE 11
PSYCHOLOGICAL ENTROPY

136
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,850
Looks like you went somewhere.

137
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,596
Yes.

138
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,044
Did you meet with Director Do,
by any chance?

139
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,600
Yes, I did.

140
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,830
What kinds of things did you

141
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,040
discuss with him?

142
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,800
Do I really need to report things
like that to you?

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,870
I was just wondering if he said
anything about me.

144
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,570
Actually...

145
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,880
I received an unbelievable offer.

146
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,740
An unbelievable offer, eh?

147
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,820
And what was that, I wonder?

148
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,480
He said he'd give me a 15 percent salary

149
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,905
increase and add 100,000 dollars
for my research every year.

150
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,750
So?

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,760
Did you agree to take him up on
his offer, then?

152
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,390
Did you agree to
take him up on his offer?

153
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,214
Did you agree to take him up on
his offer, Dr Kang Dong-joo?

154
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,879
I told him that I'd think it over.

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,849
It was so unexpected, you see.

156
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,481
So I didn't want to accept it right
then and there.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,333
So by that, you're saying that you
will eventually accept his offer.

158
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,380
Wouldn't it be weird not to accept
such an offer?

159
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,111
It's quite an attractive offer,
after all.

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,167
I'll be heading in, then.

161
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm a bit tired, you see.

162
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,706
We're ready to perform the thoracentesis.

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,766
Okay.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,442
Okay, then. I'll get started.

165
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,742
Okay, almost done.

166
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,965
Please send this out to
a lab to be examined.

167
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,100
Yes, I see.

168
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,759
Let me know if you get
more than 1 liter of fluid out.

169
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
I'll decide whether or not to extract
more depending on his condition.

170
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,590
Yes, I will.

171
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,005
Okay, good work.

172
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,250
What? Do you have something to say to me?

173
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,520
Yes, well, that's...

174
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,010
If it's not about the patient,
save it for later.

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,730
-Teacher Kim!
-Yes?

176
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,350
Thank goodness I found you here.

177
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,950
We have an emergency on our hands.

178
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,400
An emergency?

179
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,026
Apparently, Director Do made an
unexpected offer to Dr Kang Dong-joo.

180
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,510
He offered a 15 percent increase in
his yearly salary

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,430
as well as 100,000 dollars for his
research every year!

182
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,780
He made direct attacks to try and
kick people out

183
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,650
in the incident involving Dr Yoon
but this time, he's attacking by

184
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,573
appealing to Dr Kang with money.

185
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,510
If this happens, Doldam Hospital
faces the risk of shutting down.

186
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,150
Isn't that right?

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,250
What?

188
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Doldam Hospital shutting down?

189
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,390
What are you doing?
Stop making so much noise.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,060
Hey, can't you hear me?

191
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,340
I said, can't you see that
I'm sleeping right now?

192
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,810
No, I didn't see you.

193
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,896
You were sleeping?

194
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,550
I heard that you met up with Director Do.

195
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,200
You heard about that already, Dr Yoon?

196
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,980
I heard you'd be getting a 15 percent pay

197
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,130
raise as well as 100,000 dollars
for your research every year.

198
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,460
So? Are you going to go?

199
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,053
I'm still thinking about it.

200
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,930
So that means that you really
do want to take the offer.

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,910
Wouldn't you be on the fence
about an offer like that, too?

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,738
No. Not at all.

203
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,410
The fact that he offered a surgical
fellow lacking in experience that

204
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,380
kind of money means that he really
wants something from you.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,030
And you'll do whatever it takes to

206
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,161
meet his expectations due to
what he gave you.

207
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,343
It'll consume you and wear you out.

208
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,785
And then your life, as well as your
conscience, will be destroyed.

209
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,094
Aren't you being a bit overdramatic?

210
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,626
All I did was hear out his offer.

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,910
But you're dooming my life and my
conscience because of that?

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,839
Nothing in life is free.

213
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,480
That's based on my own life
experience, anyway.

214
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,267
Why are you so worried?

215
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,374
If he wants to go, he'll go.
Otherwise, he won't.

216
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,170
It's because he could end up losing

217
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,422
everything in one go just because
of a seemingly tantalizing offer.

218
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,424
Do you like Kang Dong-joo that much?

219
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,279
Why are you talking that non sense,
all of the sudden?

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,027
That came out of nowhere.

221
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,850
Aren't you two dating?

222
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,533
Dating? Who's dating?

223
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,636
Me? And Kang Dong-joo?

224
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,179
Oh, that's just ridiculous.

225
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,430
Who said that we were dating?

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,490
Did Kang Dong-joo say that?

227
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,600
No. It just seems that way to me.

228
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,420
Then you obviously need to get
your eyes checked!

229
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,011
No, no! It's not like that at all!

230
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,860
Wow. Who's dating whom, now?

231
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,472
Yes, Director?

232
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,158
Oh... right now?

233
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,420
Who's that guy?

234
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,290
Oh, Dr Kang!
I was just about to call you.

235
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,220
A patient just came in with
a stomachache.

236
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,960
Did Dr Jung In-soo go somewhere?

237
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,990
It's lunchtime for him.

238
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,790
Should I just call him?

239
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,651
No, I'll take care of him.

240
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
What brings you here today?

241
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,815
Oh, I'm not the one who's ill.
It's my friend.

242
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,310
Oh, I see.

243
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,500
Um, excuse me.

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Could you call a different doctor?

245
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,050
I'd like that doctor who stitched up
my knee last time to see him.

246
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,240
It's lunchtime right now,
so I'm the only one available.

247
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,350
I'll do a quick examination of him first.

248
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,337
Okay.

249
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,660
Dr Uhm!

250
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,509
Yes?

251
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,658
Where does it hurt, sir?

252
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,724
His stomach.

253
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,695
He kept saying that his stomach
hurt since last night.

254
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,890
Let's lay you down, sir.

255
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,778
Slowly.

256
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,404
I'll be examining you now.

257
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
How are his vitals?

258
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,590
BP is 100/70 and his heart rate is 130.

259
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
-Please take his temperature.
-Yes, Doctor.

260
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,820
Sir, I'm going to touch
your stomach for a bit.

261
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,400
He has quite a bit of tenderness here.

262
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,030
His temperature is 103 degree Farenheit.

263
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,630
-Let's run a FAST examination on him.
-Yes, Doctor.

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,200
Does that hurt, too?

265
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,475
Sir, how did you get hurt?

266
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,856
When did you get hurt?

267
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,081
Um, Doctor.

268
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,919
Couldn't you give him
a pain reliever first?

269
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,946
-Did you hit him?
-No!

270
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,050
Dr Kang.

271
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,397
Move.

272
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,027
We have some fluid buildup here.

273
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,034
Maybe it's a traumatic hemoperitoneum?

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,280
Please put two lines him and give
him two liters of hydration.

275
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,709
Mix 50 ml of Demeroland two doses of
Denogan together and give that to him.

276
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,800
Keep him hydrated, and we'll
do a CT scan of him.

277
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Let's maintain his heart rate, too.

278
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Yes, Doctor.

279
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,407
Sir, we're going to give you pain
relievers and take you to get a CT scan.

280
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,782
Sit tight for just a bit.

281
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,670
Are you okay?

282
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,029
-Nurse Oh.
-Yes?

283
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,443
There's something off about those two.

284
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,566
What should I do?

285
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,277
Something's off? What do you mean?

286
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,571
I think that the patient with a
stomachache was badly beaten.

287
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,953
And judging from the vibes
the other kid is giving me

288
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,780
I don't think we should keep
them together.

289
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,071
Yong-gyun.

290
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,730
What do we do?

291
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,922
Don't worry.

292
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,619
Let's just get you that pain reliever
and get you out.

293
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,229
What?

294
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,745
A lawsuit?

295
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,771
Toward whom? Me?

296
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,743
Are you the one who took
the blood sample from

297
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,745
the drunk driver yesterday?

298
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,247
Yes, so?

299
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,000
Drawing blood from him when you
didn't have his consent can

300
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,320
be charged as causing bodily harm
to a person.

301
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,807
Did you know that?

302
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,225
What are you talking about?
I did get consent.

303
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,026
-You did?
-Yes.

304
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,274
See? She said she did!

305
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,350
Do you have a signed consent form?

306
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,692
It wasn't a situation in which I could
get one signed, but I got verbal consent.

307
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,910
He said that he wouldn't take
the breathalyzer test and

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,440
insisted on getting his blood drawn.

309
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,425
But he says that he has
no recollection of that.

310
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,540
Geez...

311
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,825
Excuse me. Let's chat for a bit.

312
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,683
Hey.

313
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey, I'm dying! Let me go!

314
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,505
Just get through it.

315
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,125
Why, you little...

316
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,337
You definitely said yesterday that

317
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,695
you didn't want the breathalyzer test
and that you'd get your blood drawn!

318
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,483
That's why I took your blood,
so why are you lying now?

319
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,633
Who are you?

320
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,182
Mom.

321
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,301
It's her.

322
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,706
The doctor lady who took my blood.

323
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,627
Oh!

324
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,930
So you're the one who took my
precious son's blood without permission.

325
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,601
I heard that you're suing me for damages.

326
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,640
If this is about that, discuss it with
our attorney.

327
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,010
We've entrusted that matter to him.

328
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,133
My son, I bought you some hangover stew!

329
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,250
-Here, you have one too.
-Thank you.

330
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,007
Ah, here you go. Here!

331
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,590
Did you ask for extra meat?

332
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,822
Of course I asked! Who am I, after all?

333
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,550
Hurry up and eat.

334
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,647
It's good.

335
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,553
Look here.

336
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,564
People died!

337
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,679
One person died on the scene,
and another died in the ER.

338
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,160
There were eight people injured
in total and

339
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,153
the two roadside workers
even lost their legs!

340
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,879
So what?

341
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,933
So how the heck can you manage
to swallow hangover soup?

342
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,890
How could you be sitting here
laughing, playing games?

343
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,159
Look at this ridiculous woman.

344
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,804
It's not like you gave me any money
to buy them the hangover soup.

345
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,360
Why are you yelling at me when
I'm treating my son's hangover?

346
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,416
His blood alcohol level was 0.18.

347
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,822
He pretty much had a death wish,
driving when he was that drunk!

348
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,692
We'll take care of the legal
proceedings ourselves.

349
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,540
And as for the victims, we can talk to
the insurance companies and attorneys

350
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,618
and give them a nice payout!

351
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:40,430
How dare you put on that fake
doctor act in front of me, huh?

352
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,425
Are you a judge? I don't think so.

353
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,427
Don't you feel sorry in the slightest,
as a human being?

354
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,160
Sometimes, young men drink
alcohol and drive!

355
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,300
Didn't you hear me? People died, Darn it!

356
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,590
Geez, this hospital is intolerable!

357
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,100
We need to hurry and get you discharged.

358
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,131
Mom.

359
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,718
I can't.

360
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,788
If I leave the hospital,
I have to go to the police station.

361
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,089
Attorney Hong told me to stay
at the hospital for now.

362
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,779
This isn't the only hospital around!

363
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,812
Just sit here and eat.
Mommy will take care of all this.

364
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,061
Okay.

365
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,385
Yeah, Attorney Hong? It's me.

366
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,530
Some lousy doctor popped out of
nowhere and is being so bossy.

367
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,843
Ugh, it's giving me such a headache!

368
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,098
Have you eaten yet?

369
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,115
This isn't a hemoperitoneum.
It's panperitonitis.

370
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,796
So, a bowel perforation?

371
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,795
There are multiple diverticula but

372
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,850
I don't think it's
diverticulitis perforation.

373
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,292
I think it's a trauma-related
bowel perforation.

374
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,826
There were bruises around the
patient's abdomen, too.

375
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,430
So I think that's
the most likely scenario.

376
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,372
We'll have to hurry and do an
emergency operation due to sepsis.

377
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,685
I'll do it.

378
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,459
I'll tell Do In-bum to assist you.

379
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,964
Nurse Oh. Call Do In-bum, please.

380
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,159
Yes, Doctor.

381
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,323
You're... not going to ask anything?

382
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,446
What are you talking about?

383
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,116
I met with Director Do today.

384
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,505
And I felt that you probably
knew about that.

385
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,446
Would anything change if I knew?

386
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,422
I still thought that you
might say something.

387
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,490
You're the one living your
own life, anyway.

388
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,190
And the decisions in your life
are yours to make.

389
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,638
Our hospital could never offer
you such incentives.

390
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,288
So go and do as you please.

391
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,740
I thought you told me to become
a doctor who is needed.

392
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,203
You said that to me before, and yet...

393
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,634
now you're telling me to accept
the good offers?

394
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,250
I'm saying that I can't stop you from
doing what you want to do.

395
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,590
Even if I were to give you
reasons to stay here

396
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,642
you'll be haunted by
the what-ifs forever.

397
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,327
Why did you say that to him?

398
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,100
What do you mean?

399
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,690
You actually do want to ask him to
stay, don't you?

400
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,846
It would've been nice if you told
him he's a doctor that our hospital needs.

401
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,970
I felt like Dr Kang wanted to hear
that from you.

402
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,470
People have to make their own
decisions in life.

403
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,085
So let's say that I told him to

404
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,320
forget about that offer and stay here.

405
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,220
Do you think he'd be happy?

406
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,270
If he, himself, can't find a reason to

407
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,799
remain here, he wouldn't be happy
here even if this place were heaven.

408
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,510
Dr Kang respects you, Teacher Kim.

409
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
No way.

410
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,599
He only wants to learn
surgery skills from me.

411
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,118
He's still only at that level.

412
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,255
Oh... oh geez.

413
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,561
-Are you aware of this?
-Of what?

414
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,065
That you're a really twisted person?

415
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,711
Wait, me?

416
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,335
Yes, you, Teacher Kim!

417
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,180
They probably turned their
consciences into soup!

418
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,680
How dare they say that to me?

419
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,350
He's always acting like he's
better than someone.

420
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,210
Ugh, I've never met such a...

421
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,280
How could someone be so
stupidly stubborn?

422
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,090
No, how could people be so
shameless, Nurse Oh?

423
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,783
Who'd like someone who says hurtful
things all the time without context?

424
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,390
It's not like the world will end if
he's honest about his feelings!

425
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,600
People died and got hurt, and yet
they didn't even say sorry!

426
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,406
And what's worse is she bought her
son soup to cure his hangover.

427
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,500
What kind of senseless...
how does this make any sense?

428
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,480
I mean, I've known him for a long
time, so I guess I understand him.

429
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,340
But how is someone like Dr Kang,

430
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,550
who hasn't know him long supposed
to understand Teacher Kim?

431
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,122
-Isn't that right?
-That's what I am saying.

432
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,840
Wait, did something happen?

433
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,995
He told Dr Kang to go if he wanted
to and that he wouldn't hold him back.

434
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,920
Teacher Kim said that to Dr Kang.

435
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,760
What? Really?

436
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,030
No way!

437
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,470
That's what I am saying.

438
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,770
But what were you talking about, Dr Yoon?

439
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,600
I got hit with a lawsuit just now.

440
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,570
From someone who drove while drunk.

441
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,685
What did you say?

442
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,015
What kind of crazy jerk...

443
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
I don't know what the world is coming to.

444
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,443
Exactly, Nurse Oh.

445
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,370
Excuse us.

446
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,490
What brings you here?

447
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,401
There's a deserter on the run who
ran away from a nearby military base.

448
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,326
We're trying to find him now.

449
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,015
A deserter?

450
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,579
May we look around
the hospital for a bit?

451
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,870
Please do a cursory inspection so as

452
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,493
to not make the patients uncomfortable
and take your leave.

453
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,950
Excuse me.

454
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,013
What?

455
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,390
Bear it just for a bit, okay?

456
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,930
Excuse me, sir.
We'll be taking you to the OR now.

457
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,040
Have you seen the patient that was
in that bed, Dr Uhm?

458
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,980
-Why? Is he not there?
-No, he's not.

459
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,680
And his friend is gone, too.

460
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,457
What? That's strange.

461
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,930
What's going on?

462
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,357
I was going to take the patient with
panperitonitis into the OR but he's gone.

463
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,810
He's gone?

464
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,407
What did the man look like?
How old is he?

465
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,041
He looked like he was in
his early to mid 20s.

466
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,970
Did he look like this, by any chance?

467
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,830
Oh... yes. That's right.

468
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,957
-Hey, come with me.
-Yes, sir!

469
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,500
What's going on, Nurse Oh? What happened?

470
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,210
They said that he's a deserter.

471
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,598
-What?
-What?

472
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,950
A deserter?

473
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,733
Yeah, that patient is a deserter.

474
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,210
Some policemen wearing civilian
clothes are searching the hospital now.

475
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,457
But those kids are nowhere to be seen.

476
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,711
He shouldn't be moving so much like that.

477
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,512
He has panperitonitis, so he could
die if we don't operate on him now.

478
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,990
Let's go.

479
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,350
Hey, Joo-hyuk. Wake up, man!

480
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,740
Yong-gyun.

481
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,776
I... don't think I'll make it.

482
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,650
It... hurts too much.

483
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,100
Open your eyes! Open your eyes, Joo-hyuk!

484
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,720
No.

485
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,510
Are you on your way out from
Doldam Hospital?

486
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,586
Where are you taking him when
his condition is this bad?

487
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,036
-Hurry and get him on your back.
-No!

488
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,821
We can't go to that hospital.

489
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,403
If my friend goes there,
he'll get arrested!

490
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,251
But if he doesn't go back to the
hospital now, he could die!

491
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,123
Dr Kang. I just got a call from
Dr Nam Do-il.

492
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:05,191
He's coming back to the ER now
with the patient who's a deserter.

493
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,060
Aren't you going with them?

494
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,581
Sir, can you hear my voice?

495
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,022
Sir!

496
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,740
What happened?

497
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,400
He fell unconscious on the side
of the road.

498
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,270
-What are his vitals?
-BP is 80/40.

499
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,470
Not too good.

500
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,100
And his temperature is
103 degrees Fahrenheit. It's quite high.

501
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,678
How could you take the patient
outside when he's in this state?

502
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,420
Did you get a consent form
from the patient?

503
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,680
Yes, he signed it himself when
he was conscious.

504
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,790
-Okay.
-Doctor.

505
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,516
Yeah. I'll hurry over after
I get changed.

506
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,610
Let's move the patient to the
operating room first.

507
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,721
Wait!

508
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,787
Move.

509
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,297
So it is you, Private Park Joo-hyuk.

510
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,624
Call them.

511
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,787
Look here, Private Park Joo-hyuk.

512
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,791
Park Joo-hyuk.

513
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,702
You have the right to remain silent.

514
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,850
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in court.

515
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,235
And you have the right to an attorney.

516
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,779
-Got that?
-Look here.

517
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,550
What the heck are you doing with
someone who's not even conscious?

518
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,616
Oh, you're supposed to recite the
Miranda rights when arresting people.

519
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,690
We'll be taking this person into
our custody now.

520
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,784
You can't.

521
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,648
This patient has sepsis and may
die if he doesn't get surgery now.

522
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,400
I'll call the army and get them to
send an escort vehicle.

523
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,000
Can't you see the patient's condition?

524
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,970
We don't have any time to waste!

525
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,270
Hey, hey. If you have no time to waste,

526
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,239
hurry and get him to the OR.

527
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,800
What are you all doing?

528
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Doctor.

529
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,158
Are you the one in charge
at this hospital?

530
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,755
Well, not exactly.

531
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,810
But I do have the authority to be in
charge of this patient's surgery.

532
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,050
He's a deserter.

533
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,764
And we need to take him with us.

534
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,554
All right, then.
Take him away after the surgery.

535
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,682
If you keep acting this way, we can
charge you for obstruction of justice.

536
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:34,399
Don't you know that you can't take
a patient without his doctor's consent?

537
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,230
Surely you've heard of
"prevention of medical care."

538
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,322
-Who's the doctor in charge of him?
-Yes?

539
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,931
What are you standing around for?

540
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,315
Hurry and take him to the OR!

541
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,538
Yes, sir. Let's go.

542
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,079
Excuse me.

543
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,386
There's no need to worry.

544
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,239
I mean, he was on the brink of death.

545
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,212
It's not like he'd run away from the OR.

546
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,150
Do you know his parents'
contact information?

547
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Yes, I do.

548
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,539
Hurry and call them.

549
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,420
And tell them to come to the hospital
as soon as possible.

550
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,840
Yes, I will.

551
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,830
Use a Cline and mix ODW to

552
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,100
32 ml of morphine and

553
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,560
give him 10 cc per hour.

554
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,630
Yes, Doctor.

555
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,800
How's the patient doing?

556
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,188
BP is 70/40. He's hanging on for now.

557
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,739
-May I start, then?
-Okay.

558
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,418
What is that?

559
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,732
Teacher Kim told me to record
today's surgery.

560
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,417
Please get started, Dr Kang.

561
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,261
Scalpel.

562
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,407
I'll report to you right away, sir.

563
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,496
Yes, sir.

564
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,688
The situation here has gotten
a bit complicated.

565
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,910
Yes, I don't think so.

566
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,621
Those people seem quite worked up.

567
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,780
A deserter is being operated on at

568
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,939
a regular hospital so I'm sure that
they've got a lot on their plates.

569
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,616
Every time there's a news story

570
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,690
about violence in the army

571
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,907
a couple of people end up
being forced to resign.

572
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,080
By the way... what part of the military
did you serve in, Section Chief Jang?

573
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,653
What?

574
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,430
Why are you asking me that all of
the sudden?

575
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,017
I just got curious all of the sudden.

576
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,602
So, where did you serve?

577
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,432
Well, that is...

578
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,610
Um...

579
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,926
Oh, you were in the army?

580
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,707
Oh, I see.

581
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,300
Oh, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

582
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,527
So this is where you were.

583
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,035
Let's chat for a bit.

584
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,753
What could Chief Song want with me?

585
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,180
Yes, I wonder.

586
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,046
Did you call...

587
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,588
for me?

588
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,913
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

589
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,470
Did you go into a patient's room
today and threaten his safety?

590
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,460
What?

591
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,130
Threaten his safety?

592
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,962
How dare you barge into a patient's
room and scold him, saying he has

593
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,968
no remorse and tell him how many
people were hurt and died!

594
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,513
Why did you have to say such
unnecessary things to him?

595
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,956
Stop parading around with your
false sense of justice, Dr Yoon!

596
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,855
All a doctor needs to do is her job,
all right?

597
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:48,707
Apologize to them, right now.

598
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,712
Right now.

599
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,474
What did you just tell me to do?

600
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,572
Hey.

601
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,164
Didn't you hear me? Apologize to them!

602
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,688
I'm afraid that I can't do that.

603
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,239
What did you say?

604
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,420
Yes, it's true that I was overwhelmed
by my emotions and went to the

605
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,571
patient's room and told him about how
many people were injured or dead.

606
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,166
And I acknowledge that it was wrong
of me to go so far.

607
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,890
But I will not apologize.

608
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,237
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

609
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,212
Apologize? Please.

610
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,633
They would be fine if we discharged
them with some pain relief patches.

611
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,448
The car they were driving was such
an expensive foreign car so six

612
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,066
airbags went off, and they were
completely unscathed.

613
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,820
They're just lingering here because they
don't want to go to the police station!

614
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,031
Look here, Miss!

615
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,393
Are you finished?

616
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,095
I'm not "Miss."

617
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,379
I'm Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

618
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,469
Geez, there's no discipline in this
hospital, is there, Chief Song?

619
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,753
Oh my.

620
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,818
It hasn't been long since I was
dispatched here, I'm afraid.

621
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,212
How dare you act so rudely?

622
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,394
Apologize right now.

623
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,816
Apologize for everything, including
what you just said!

624
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,611
I already told you that I wouldn't.

625
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,130
You dare defy the order of the
Chief of the Surgical Department?

626
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,721
How about you give me an order
I can actually follow then, "Chief"?

627
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,195
If this is all you had to say,
I'll be going now.

628
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,190
Why, that little...

629
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,242
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung!

630
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,255
Stop right there!

631
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,136
Look here, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

632
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,685
Just consider how you're making
me look by acting like that!

633
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,740
That woman is close to the governor

634
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,292
of Gangwon Province and is
Assemblyman Han Ki-joong's wife!

635
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,495
So what?

636
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,350
Why should I care if she is close to

637
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,825
the governor and why should I care
if she's the wife of an assemblyman?

638
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,928
You really have no sense of reality,
do you?

639
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,830
It may hurt your pride, but you should

640
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,560
just give them a basic apology and
let this go, already.

641
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,730
That's what's going on!

642
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,160
And I keep asking you, why should I?

643
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,190
I'm not a politician or a government
worker.

644
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,939
I'm a doctor, just as you said,
Chief Song.

645
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,594
I thought you said doctors should
just worry about doing their jobs!

646
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,001
So why should I have to concede
to people like them?

647
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,616
That's just how the world works!
You got that?

648
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,220
Just go and say sorry first.

649
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,670
That's the only way to smooth this over.

650
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,790
And as for the lawsuit, I'll put in a
good word for you and resolve it.

651
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,842
No thanks.

652
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,259
Just tell them to sue me.

653
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,239
Why, that...

654
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,060
Geez.

655
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,371
Hey! Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

656
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,255
You'd better write a letter of apology
and submit it by tomorrow!

657
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,662
You got that?

658
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,446
You'll be coming with me for a bit, sir.

659
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,570
Where are we going?

660
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,006
Hey, wait!

661
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,460
Please get up, and sit here.

662
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,330
Hey, I already got all the tests
that I needed.

663
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,940
I asked you where we're going!

664
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,345
What are you doing?

665
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,749
Take a good look at

666
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:28,856
what you've done.

667
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,963
You said that it'd be over as soon
as you paid them off?

668
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,954
Does that look like a problem that'll
be solved just by paying them off?

669
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,810
Get a look at them!

670
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,679
You need to see with your own eyes
what you did in order to repent!

671
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,242
Your money is your skill and

672
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,148
your rich mother is your credentials.

673
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,997
That's fine.

674
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,051
That's fine and all...

675
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,269
But still...

676
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,190
You should have a basic idea of
what it means to have a conscience.

677
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,160
What are you doing over there?

678
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,886
Mom!

679
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,657
Are you crying?

680
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,993
-Did you just hit me?
-Yeah, I did!

681
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,955
What are you going to do about it?
Are you going to sue me, or something?

682
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,350
Go ahead, then!

683
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,630
How dare you go and make
someone else's precious son cry?

684
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,949
Who the heck do you think you are?

685
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,558
Why are you so shameless?

686
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,814
You did nothing right.

687
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:23,957
What did you just say?

688
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,998
You have no remorse or shame whatsoever.

689
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,574
Since when did the world become a

690
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,583
place where people like you can
act so high and mighty?

691
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,606
Why, you little...

692
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:36,614
That's enough.

693
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,432
I'll definitely be suing you
for hitting me just now.

694
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,130
I definitely won't drop the charges
or settle out of court.

695
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,288
So be aware of that.

696
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,966
What kind of...

697
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,300
Oh my, oh my! What on earth?

698
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,288
How ridiculous!

699
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,920
This is so ridiculous!

700
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,239
What on earth? That little...

701
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,721
There's no inflammatory tissue
near the perforation site.

702
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,799
It's definitely not near the
diverticulitis perforation, right?

703
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,668
It's not.

704
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,099
It definitely seems that it was
caused by trauma, then.

705
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,243
I guess they beat him half to death.

706
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,030
Maybe he's an outcast in the army,
or something?

707
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,649
It's only natural that he ran away
when he was beaten up like this.

708
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,898
We'll perform a bowel resection and
then a functional end to end anastomosis.

709
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,641
Dr Kang. His BP keeps dropping.

710
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,431
Please raise his morphine dosage
to 20 cc.

711
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,500
Yes, Doctor.

712
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,580
Is he all right?

713
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,533
I think he's undergoing septic shock.

714
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,080
It'd be best to hurry.

715
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,987
Yes, Doctor.

716
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,037
GIA.

717
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Here's the specimen.

718
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,360
Warm saline, please.

719
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,861
Please keep passing more to us.

720
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,780
Teacher Kim!

721
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,891
-Teacher Kim.
-Yes?

722
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,679
-I've been looking all over for you!
-What is it?

723
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,521
You'll need to come with me to the
director's office for a bit.

724
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,035
It seems that Dr Yoon Seo-Jung has
caused trouble again.

725
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,570
There really is no sense of discipline
at this hospital.

726
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,444
It's bad enough that she dismissed
a chief doctor's orders but she spoke

727
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:03,013
out of turn to a patient and his
guardian, as well.

728
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,067
Why, you...

729
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:08,214
This isn't right, is it, Director Yeo?

730
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,570
I was just about to let this slide.

731
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,836
But you were so impudent and it
pisses me off so much!

732
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,364
So I can't just let this slide!

733
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,508
Get on your knees right now and
apologize to me!

734
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,272
I need to get an apology from you!

735
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,580
What are you doing?

736
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,203
She wants you to apologize.

737
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,565
Pardon?

738
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,905
Apologize.

739
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,237
A 45 degree bow will do.

740
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,067
What do you mean, just a 45 degree bow?

741
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:52,131
I mean, I don't think this is something
she needs to kneel and apologize for.

742
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,580
But you keep insisting that she
apologize, so we can't just ignore it.

743
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,630
So, Ma'am.

744
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,960
Let's just settle for a 45 degree bow of
apology from her, shall we?

745
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,120
Look here, Teacher Kim.

746
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,487
Oh... oh yeah!

747
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,589
Before that, we need to hear
your apology.

748
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,715
What are you saying?

749
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,154
I heard that you hit her.

750
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,534
So obviously, you should
apologize to her first.

751
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,440
Even if you're not going to
compensate her for damages.

752
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,727
Are you playing games with me right now?

753
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,492
Do I seem like I'm joking right now?

754
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,824
So you're going to do things
that way, huh?

755
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,679
Fine, then.

756
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,486
It seems that she has no intention
of apologizing.

757
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,790
Let's settle this legally, then.

758
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:37,110
I'm going to humiliate the heck out of
you and that female doctor over there!

759
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,809
Sure, go ahead.

760
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,397
I'm an expert when it comes to
getting down and dirty, you see.

761
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,824
Come on, why are you being like this?

762
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,890
You should be defusing the situation,
not exacerbating it!

763
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,896
All you have to do is get
Yoon Seo-Jung to apologize.

764
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,940
Why do you insist on making this
more and more complicated?

765
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,161
Darn it.

766
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,845
Will that be all right
for you though, ma'am?

767
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,678
Those who have a lot usually lose
the most in messy spats like these.

768
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,203
What?

769
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,430
People like Director Yeo or
Section Chief Jang here are

770
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,987
such gentlemen that they can't do this.

771
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,013
But I'm different from them.

772
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,617
Once I go crazy, I'm unstoppable and

773
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,326
I don't quit until it's over.

774
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,533
Oh well.

775
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,705
You're going to end up being
so humiliated.

776
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,714
Are you threatening me, right now?

777
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,169
You're the one who threatened us first.

778
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,584
You used your husband's resources
to act all high and mighty.

779
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,220
Are you finished talking?

780
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,286
Your son drank a ton of wine and
caused a six-car collision!

781
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,560
And then you, his mother, came to
the hospital and dared to try and

782
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,600
assert your dominance over
the doctors here?

783
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,696
Wow, I bet this will make for a really
interesting newspaper article.

784
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,910
Will you be okay after that?

785
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,092
Why you...

786
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,792
Darn it!

787
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,229
You apologize first.

788
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,365
If you don't, she won't, either.

789
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,400
What's wrong with you?
Why are you smiling like that?

790
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,241
Because this is the first time you've
sided with me, Doctor.

791
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,770
It made me feel great.

792
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,467
I'm officially one of your disciples now.

793
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,910
Right?

794
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,875
Who said that you were my disciple?

795
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,437
Am... I not?

796
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,283
I don't take on any disciples.

797
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,106
Maybe the disciple he killed was
Jang Hyung-joo?

798
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,564
I'm going to be your disciple even
if you don't take me on.

799
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,676
It's my dream to be like you, Doctor!

800
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,371
Be sure to maintain your composure
in front of patients from now on.

801
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,157
He may be the one who caused the
accident, but he's still your patient.

802
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,987
Got that?

803
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,542
Yes, I understand.

804
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,718
I'll be sure to keep that in mind,
Teacher Kim!

805
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,074
Excuse me.

806
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,325
I'm sorry.

807
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,257
Really.

808
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,869
I'm sorry.

809
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,216
Oh, what will we do?

810
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,018
Yes, this is the ICU.

811
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,124
We're sending a patient there now.
Please prepare a bed.

812
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,681
Oh, but I can't.

813
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:25,300
All the patients in the ICU now need
to be watched over until tomorrow.

814
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,172
They can't prepare a bed in the
ICU right now.

815
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,178
What should we do?

816
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,440
Let's move him to the hybrid room
for now.

817
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,930
Will we be able to provide adequate
care for him there?

818
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,139
I'll monitor him.

819
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,931
Let's do that until we get him
a spot in the ICU.

820
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,046
Yes, Doctor.

821
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,560
Send that to the pathologists.

822
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,683
Yes, Doctor.

823
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,979
We'll be moving the patient now.

824
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,000
Please run an ABG test on him.

825
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:52,960
Yes, Doctor.

826
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,300
This isn't looking good.

827
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,110
How are his vitals?

828
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,740
BP is 80/40, with 130 bpm.

829
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,320
What dose of morphine did you give
the patient towards the end?

830
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,188
20 cc.

831
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,121
Double his dose, please.

832
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,680
Is he urinating at all?

833
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,127
No.

834
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,480
Please wrap him one more time.

835
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,930
Are the results for his ABG out?

836
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:15,020
Yes, here you are.

837
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,946
He has severe acidosis.

838
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,070
Give me 3 Bs, please.

839
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,370
And not into the Cline. Somewhere else.

840
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,324
Yes, Doctor.

841
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,690
-What about his guardians?
-I don't think they're here yet.

842
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,140
The patient is in a very critical
state right now.

843
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,747
Was the surgery unsuccessful?

844
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,787
No, the surgery went fine.

845
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,668
We managed to patch up the
puncture and staple the rupture up.

846
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:57,252
But he has severe inflammation in
his abdomen, so he had a septic shock.

847
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,421
What happens now, then?

848
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,664
We're administering hypertensive
medication to him right now but if his

849
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,630
blood pressure keeps falling,
his organs will fail one by one.

850
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,660
And eventually, he may die.

851
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,110
I see.

852
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,350
Then, what are the chances that
he'll die, exactly?

853
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,157
I can't say for certain yet, but with
that aside...

854
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:31,173
it seemed to me that the patient's
injuries were due to blunt trauma.

855
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,693
What do you mean, blunt trauma?

856
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,670
To put it simply, it seemed that he
was beaten up.

857
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,671
And he has too many bruises in

858
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,650
different spots for it to have been
one person.

859
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,460
There's a huge possibility that two

860
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,765
or more people were involved in
the assault.

861
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,598
Are you... implying that there is

862
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:54,676
group bullying going on in the army?

863
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,092
I'm just speaking to you regarding
the source of those injuries.

864
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,286
I see.

865
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,240
Wow! Nice shot!

866
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,691
Oh, it's been a while.

867
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,087
I've been busy lately, so I've been
unable to contact you.

868
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,291
To what do I owe this pleasure?

869
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,183
Oh, so something like that happened?

870
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,656
I understand.

871
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,883
I'll be sure to do everything I can
to make this right.

872
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,000
Goodbye.

873
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,911
Yes, Director? It's me!

874
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,140
You wouldn't pick up my calls,
so I was worried.

875
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,757
I heard that a deserter was
admitted there today.

876
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,210
Oh, is that right?

877
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,160
Just what on earth are you even
doing over there?

878
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,171
You weren't even aware?

879
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,380
Forgive me.

880
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,826
I'll go and look into it now.

881
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,682
Find out who the surgeon who

882
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,934
operated on him is and check the
patient's condition.

883
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,682
And find out if that patient will
survive until tomorrow, too!

884
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:10,952
Yes, sir!

885
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,801
Hey, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

886
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,775
Yes?

887
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,998
I heard that a deserter was
admitted to this hospital.

888
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,950
I just finished his surgery and
he's in the hybrid room now.

889
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,120
There's no space in the ICU for him.

890
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,828
Were you the one in charge of
the operation?

891
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,090
Yes. Why?

892
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,500
Oh, I see.

893
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,410
Doctor, he's going into cardiac arrest!

894
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,470
Get him epinephrine! 1 ml per 3 minutes!

895
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,105
What happened?

896
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,941
His BP starting falling a lot all of
the sudden.

897
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,060
And then he went into a PEA
cardiac arrest.

898
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,453
Checking his heart rate now.

899
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,930
Performing compressions now!

900
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,114
Here, I'll do it.

901
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,935
Yes, Director. It's me.

902
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,630
The situation doesn't look too good.

903
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,840
The patient has gone into cardiac

904
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,526
arrest and I think Kang Dong-joo
operated on him.

905
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,570
And according to the paperwork,
he's the doctor in charge of him.

906
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,435
All right, then. I'll head there now.

907
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,951
Yes, I understand.

908
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,434
Then, on his death certificate,

909
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,198
I should say that his death was
from a disease?

910
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,093
Yes. I'll do that.

911
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,361
Did someone die?

912
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,549
What do you mean?

913
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,941
I mean, you were talking about
a death certificate just now.

914
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,504
So I wanted to know whose it was.

915
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,797
I have no idea what you mean.

916
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,580
Did I hear some nonsense just now, then?

917
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,350
Um...

918
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,409
Why is he looking at me like that?

919
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,644
Checking his pulse now!

920
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,155
His pulse is back.

921
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,224
But his vitals aren't looking good.

922
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,737
BP is 70/60, with 100 bpm.

923
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,355
He has no light reflex and isn't
showing any other stem signs.

924
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,740
At this rate, there's a high chance
that he'll become brain-dead.

925
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,060
Doctor!

926
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,470
Is that your friend?

927
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,435
Doctor, can't you go there and
examine my friend?

928
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,375
His supervising doctor is there,
so don't worry.

929
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,742
He may be young, but he's quite skilled.

930
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,510
Look here, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

931
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,956
Come see me.

932
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,323
Go on. Dr Nam and I will
hold down the fort here.

933
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,729
I'll be right back.

934
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,656
Call me if anything happens.

935
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,125
But you know...

936
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,480
why did your friend run away
from the military?

937
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,428
Can't you tell me why he
ended up becoming a deserter?

938
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:46,973
Take a seat.

939
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,392
What is it?

940
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,516
I have a favor to ask of you.

941
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,708
Open it.

942
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,904
DEATH CERTIFICATE

943
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,400
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

944
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,234
NAME: KANG DONG-JOO

945
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,614
They're in the middle of an important
meeting right now.

946
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,384
Oh, a meeting?

947
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,673
Yeah, I'm supposed to be in there.

948
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,711
What's going on here?

949
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,451
What are you doing here?

950
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,610
Director Do won't give up.

951
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:28,642
He'll start with whatever
you consider important

952
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,484
and take them, one by one.

953
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,871
So...

954
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,437
how are you planning to protect them?

955
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,958
Let's say that I can save
Doldam Hospital somehow.

956
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:54,687
But you can't win people over to
your side with money alone.

957
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,037
So what are you planning to do?

958
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,588
How are you planning to protect
your people?

959
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,380
Let me ask you one thing, too.

960
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,680
Why did you want to become a doctor?

961
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:38,650
The choices you make don't seem
to set you apart from anyone else.

962
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,990
The facts must not be altered,

963
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,860
especially when it comes to
death certificates.

964
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,590
But the facts aren't always right.

965
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,860
I'll never forgive you.

966
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,760
I can never forgive doctors like you!

967
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,400
Stop using young people to try and
satisfy your greed.

968
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,870
I'm going to risk my life to make sure
that you'll never be a doctor again!

969
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:57,473
Don't ever come back to
Doldam Hospital again.

970
00:59:57,564 --> 01:00:00,868
From this point on,
I won't just let this slide.
