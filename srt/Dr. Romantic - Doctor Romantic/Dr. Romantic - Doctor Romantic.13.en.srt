1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:02,681
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,591
What do you want?

3
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:29,263
It's about Chairman Shin's
artificial heart surgery...

4
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,164
May I be your main assistant?

5
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,854
AN AGE OF "NEEDS."

6
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,275
Make sure you're one of the doctors
performing that surgery.

7
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,446
Make sure you report each and
everything that happens in there to me.

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,685
An age in which one's own desires
are outranked by the desires of others.

9
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,955
Have you ever done any chest
surgeries before?

10
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,358
An age in which one is forced to live
according to the world's standards...

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:03,263
...before even figuring out what he
wants for himself.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,367
I observed a heart transplant surgery
once when I was an intern.

13
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,902
He adds detail to support his lies...

14
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,871
After that, I observed one aortic valve...

15
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,974
...surgery and four cardiovascular
bypass surgeries.

16
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,342
And the lies grow larger in size.

17
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,849
I've also observed one ECMO surgery.

18
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,580
And I assisted in two of the
surgeries I observed.

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,716
Sometimes we lie to make ourselves
seem better than we are.

20
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:27,187
It's really good to have dad's support.

21
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,124
You have a lot more experience
than I'd thought.

22
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:37,197
Back then, I was torn between
cardiothoracic and general surgery.

23
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,167
But if you come in as my main assistant,

24
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,394
you'll be stealing that opportunity
from Yoon Seo-Jung.

25
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,638
Are you aware of that?

26
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,610
Is it... not possible then?

27
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,483
Finally, he must even render...

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,820
...another's efforts useless and push
them down in order to raise himself up.

29
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,822
Such is what the world has come to.

30
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,228
When are you planning to operate
on Chairman Shin?

31
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,663
10 DAYS AGO

32
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,733
I ordered what I need from the supplier...

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,370
...and everything will get here either
late this week or early next week.

34
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,839
And have you thought about the...

35
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,350
...potential members of
your surgical team yet?

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,975
I don't know.

37
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:25,646
The only other cardiothoracic specialist
we have has ended up like that, so...

38
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,617
Didn't you say that it
wouldn't be too difficult since...

39
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,553
...you just need
to swap out the batteries?

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,590
There could be an issue with the
artificial heart itself.

41
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,293
Oh, do you really think so?

42
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,996
I've heard from quite a few sources...

43
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:47,868
...that Chairman Shin's artificial heart
itself may be defective.

44
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,975
Then, regarding a specific date for
the procedure...

45
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,040
We'll make preparations for all sorts
of scenarios we may encounter so...

46
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,006
...I'm thinking about doing it in
10 days or so.

47
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,910
10 days?

48
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,217
She probably understood what
we were trying to get at, right?

49
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,591
More or less, I think.

50
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,280
NINE DAYS AGO

51
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,422
EIGHT DAYS AGO

52
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,742
Oh, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

53
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,743
Yes?

54
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,111
There's a package for you.

55
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,215
Oh, I see!
It got here faster than I'd thought.

56
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,083
What's in there?

57
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,552
SEVEN DAYS AGO

58
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,393
Oh, wow!

59
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,589
SIX DAYS AGO

60
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,299
Purse string sutures?

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,701
Have you ever done one?

62
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,071
That's usually the technique used at
the end of an acute appendicitis surgery.

63
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,172
Is it really hard to do?

64
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,406
Doing the stitches themselves isn't...

65
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,107
...too difficult but
serosas are quite thin,

66
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,196
so you need to be careful.

67
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,281
You have to make the stitches
only 2 or 3 mm deep.

68
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,116
The stitches have to be that shallow?

69
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,985
You do need some experience.

70
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,322
But you know, having experience
is all part of one's skill.

71
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,024
What about blood vessels, then?

72
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,671
Have you worked on those before?

73
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,161
Blood vessels?

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,135
No, no! Less pressure on your hands!

75
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:39,640
It's important to control the pressure
of your stitches when working on organs.

76
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,741
If you apply too much pressure,

77
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,644
you could perforate it but if you don't
apply any, the needle won't go in.

78
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,646
Even I know that much.

79
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,616
Do you want to figure this out
yourself, then?

80
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,689
No, Dr Kang Dong-joo.
Please continue with your teachings.

81
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,124
Okay.

82
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,893
The most important thing when it
comes to purse string sutures is that...

83
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,496
...the needle goes in as shallowly as
you can manage it.

84
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,798
You have to pierce through
the outside of the vessel..

85
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,234
...but turn the needle around just
before hitting the intima.

86
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,870
What if the needle goes through
the endothelium, then?

87
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,305
Well, general surgeons can fudge it...

88
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,809
...and irrigate the abdominal cavity but
as for cardiothoracic surgeons...

89
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,278
Due to the immense pressure
within a main artery,

90
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,545
blood will be shooting
up to the ceiling, like a geyser.

91
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,890
What's the matter?
Is your hand still acting up?

92
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,825
I usually have no problems with it.

93
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:33,861
But if I'm focusing on something or...

94
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,607
...specifically concerned about
something it stiffens up a bit more.

95
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,098
Here, give me that.

96
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,670
Okay, do this here.

97
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,440
Have a bit of a snap in your wrist
motions, like this.

98
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,708
-Let me try.
-Sure.

99
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,946
-Like this?
-No.

100
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,215
More shallow over here.

101
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,084
Like this, then.

102
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,018
No, your hand...

103
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,790
Okay, make it as shallow as possible,

104
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,995
and then turn your hand like this.

105
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,432
Yes.

106
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,301
-Yes, like that.
-Okay.

107
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,237
Like this. Like this?

108
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,741
Wow, you're good at this!

109
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,843
Okay, one more time.

110
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,316
-You need more of a snap.
-Okay.

111
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,417
There you go!

112
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,452
Wow, you're so good!

113
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,121
Yeah, I am.

114
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,563
Hey, Section Chief Jang.
What's going on, here?

115
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,699
Teacher Kim is finally releasing the...

116
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,702
...roster of the surgical staff for
Chairman Shin's surgery.

117
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,669
Wow!

118
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:35,816
As you all know, Chairman Shin will
be admitted to our hospital tomorrow.

119
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,974
Our initial goal will be to change out the
batteries in his artificial heart but...

120
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:43,757
...the situation could change at any
moment based on his test results.

121
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,592
So keep that in mind.

122
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,694
I'm planning to hold a conference at...

123
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:52,065
...8:00 every night starting tomorrow
regarding the surgery.

124
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,668
So be aware of that,
and prepare yourselves.

125
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:59,306
Then... who will be your main
assistant during this surgery?

126
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:15,055
My main assistant
for Chairman Shin's surgery will be...

127
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,704
...Yoon Seo-Jung.

128
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,873
You do it.

129
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,281
That'll be all!

130
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:12,713
EPISODE 13
The Aesthetics of Chaos

131
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,417
The day is here, everyone!

132
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,807
Chairman Shin Myung-ho,

133
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:24,450
Chairman of the Geosan University
Hospital Foundation,

134
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,223
as well as our hospital's secret sponsor,

135
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:31,875
will be finally be admitted
to our Doldam Hospital today!

136
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,503
What a historic day this is!

137
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,670
Congratulations, Section Chief!

138
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,553
Make sure you get every nook and cranny,
as if you were cleaning your own home!

139
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,255
-Yes, sir.
-Put your soul into it and scrub!

140
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,157
-Yes, sir.
-The chairman is coming.

141
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,861
What is all this commotion about?
Why don't you just do things normally?

142
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,763
Well, that person is coming here.

143
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:10,504
Oh, how about we put a red carpet
going from his room to the lobby?

144
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,206
I think we're exaggerating it.

145
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,274
Oh, is that right?

146
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,210
Hey, be careful!

147
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,945
Yes, put the rest of the decorations
on the top.

148
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,014
-Okay, turn it on!
-Yes, sir!

149
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,750
Wow! This is nice.

150
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,959
It's already Christmas, huh?

151
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,161
Therefore...

152
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,497
...starting today, I'll be the
doctor in charge of Chairman Shin,

153
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,368
not as a board-certified ER specialist,
but as a cardiothoracic specialist.

154
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:42,970
Wow, congratulations, Dr Yoon!

155
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,039
I saw that you've been reading a
lot about artificial heart surgery!

156
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,808
-Can you tell?
-Well, of course!

157
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,610
At any rate, I'm so happy for you.

158
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,749
Congratulations!

159
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:51,879
Thank you!

160
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,680
You'll still drop by the ER
occasionally though, right?

161
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,815
Occasionally?

162
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,517
I'll be in here all the time.

163
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,718
If that's the case, then...

164
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,687
Buy us dinner! Buy us dinner!

165
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,289
Okay.

166
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,802
Yes, this is Kang Dong-joo.

167
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,839
Come to my office for a second.

168
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,474
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,895
We've made some preparations for
your stay, Mr Chairman.

170
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,866
But if you ever need anything else,
just say the word.

171
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,570
I'm Jang Ki-tae, the Section Chief of
Administration at Doldam Hospital.

172
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,742
This much is fine.

173
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,711
Thank you for your efforts.

174
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,223
Sure.

175
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,315
Who's that?

176
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:03,984
Are you the doctor in charge of me?

177
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,019
I'm the one you met last time.

178
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,732
I'm Song Hyun-chul, the Chief of the
Surgical Department at the main hospital.

179
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:13,827
And this here is Dr Do In-bum.
He's Director Do's son.

180
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,231
Nice meeting you, Mr Chairman.

181
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,068
Is that young doctor the one in
charge of me, then?

182
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,302
No, that's not it.

183
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,101
We just came up here to greet you,
Mr Chairman.

184
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:31,497
So, who's the doctor actually in
charge of me, then?

185
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,299
What's going on, Section Chief Jang?

186
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,992
What is taking the chairman's
assigned doctor so long to get here?

187
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,356
I'm here.

188
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,193
Hello, Mr Chairman.
My name is Yoon Seo-Jung.

189
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,029
I will be taking care of you.

190
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,598
It's... a woman?

191
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,204
Don't you have any male doctors to...

192
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,805
...take care of me?

193
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,440
Mr Chairman...

194
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,608
Where is Teacher Kim?

195
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,832
Call him in here, now.

196
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,815
He knows that I'm here, and yet he's
not even showing his face?

197
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,784
Get him here now!

198
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,752
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,295
Set aside some free time for this evening.

200
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,130
Is something the matter?

201
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm going to have a video conference...

202
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:31,238
...with some doctors in Cleveland tonight
regarding artificial heart surgery.

203
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,165
But there are quite a lot of materials
I need prepared.

204
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:35,682
Yes, sir.

205
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,678
Teacher Kim! Teacher Kim!

206
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,980
You'll need to hurry and go see
Chairman Shin now.

207
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:40,981
There is a problem.

208
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,226
Hey, what are you doing here?

209
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,193
Of course I should come when the...

210
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,672
...chairman of our hospital's foundation
has been admitted here.

211
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:59,933
To say hello to him and to put
myself on his radar, too.

212
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,241
But you know, it'll be difficult for
Yoon Seo-Jung to do this, it seems.

213
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,474
I think it may be better to assign
him a new doctor.

214
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,882
Why are you standing here?

215
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,416
I told you to get out.

216
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,487
I'll be explaining the tests we'll
be running on you first.

217
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,289
Look here, Doc.

218
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:26,093
Today, we'll be running a blood test
and taking an x-ray of your chest.

219
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,160
Did you not hear me?

220
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,029
Starting tonight, you'll need to
refrain from eating.

221
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,331
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be taking a CT scan of you.

222
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,234
I told you, I'm going to talk to
Teacher Kim.

223
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,236
I told you to go get Teacher Kim!

224
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:41,208
Teacher Kim has a lot to worry
about as it is, due to your surgery.

225
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,144
And I'm more than capable of
running these simple tests on you.

226
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,781
But I'm telling you, this is making
me feel uncomfortable.

227
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,008
I don't want a female doctor.

228
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,038
I feel uncomfortable right now too,
Mr Chairman.

229
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,522
What did you say?

230
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,859
Do you think you'd feel good if we
switched roles and I told you that...

231
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,995
...I felt uncomfortable treating you
since you're a man?

232
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,665
So all you have to do is not be
my doctor, then!

233
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,300
Get me a new doctor.

234
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,535
How could we possibly do that?

235
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:09,803
I'm a doctor.

236
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,605
And you're a patient, Mr Chairman.

237
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:16,443
I'll be more than happy to listen to
your complaints regarding my treatments...

238
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,415
...but I'll be ignoring other unrelated
complaints that you may have.

239
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,883
Ignoring what?

240
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,484
What are you saying?

241
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,888
Are you playing games with me right now?
Huh?

242
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:31,491
No, I'm doing my best not to
feel overwhelmed by you.

243
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,663
Because I won't be able to treat
you properly otherwise.

244
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,937
Since when have you had that cough?

245
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,542
Things like these just come and
go with old age.

246
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,609
Why would you need to know
when this cough started?

247
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:52,212
Okay, then.

248
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,282
Please change into hospital
clothing first.

249
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,320
Please take his temperature and
draw his blood.

250
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,321
Yes, Doctor.

251
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:03,523
I'll take my leave, then.

252
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,135
-Oh, Doctor.
-Yeah.

253
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,603
Hey, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

254
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,704
Are you out of your mind?

255
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,273
You're going to ignore him?

256
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,508
How dare you?

257
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,377
What am I supposed to do, then?

258
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,180
Sue a patient for gender discrimination?

259
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,181
Why, you so?

260
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:31,318
Do you think you'll be able to run
all the tests on him without problems?

261
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,489
I'll finish all of the tests within two
hours and give the patient time to rest.

262
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,959
Is there anything I need to take care
of myself, in particular?

263
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,093
No, Doctor.

264
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,828
Okay, then. Go on.

265
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:42,796
Yes, Doctor.

266
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,613
Are you just going to leave her alone?

267
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,438
When she was acting like that
to the chairman?

268
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,439
Hey.

269
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,108
If you cower in front of a patient,

270
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,615
you'll lose all credibility as a doctor
in the patient's eyes.

271
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,414
She's acting just as she should!

272
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,217
Wait...

273
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:04,985
-Teacher Kim!
-Yes?

274
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,587
Aren't you going in for a bit?

275
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,188
The chairman wishes to see you!

276
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,590
I'm busy right now.

277
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,525
Tell him I'll come by later.

278
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,593
Oh, geez!

279
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,162
We can't let him down, since he's a VIP!

280
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,098
Oh, but the chairman...

281
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,105
Yes, this is Kang Dong-joo.

282
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,807
We have an emergency patient, Dr Kang!

283
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:27,841
A 7-year-old boy.

284
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,676
He has a 13-cm laceration on his head.

285
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,714
Okay, I'll head over now.

286
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,021
What?

287
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,223
He refuses to undergo the tests?

288
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,291
Yes.

289
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,860
He keeps asking for Teacher Kim.

290
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,664
Did you draw his blood?

291
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,833
He won't even let me get a needle
anywhere near him!

292
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,537
Oh, but his body temperature is 103.

293
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,238
Please give that to me.

294
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,579
I'll be drawing your blood, Mr Chairman.

295
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,888
When did that cough get worse?

296
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,592
It's been bad since last week.

297
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,237
Is there any phlegm coming out, too?

298
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,429
Yes, I believe so.

299
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,264
Did you see what color the phlegm was?

300
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:32,873
What are you doing?

301
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,277
What are you doing when your
elder is enjoying some TV?

302
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,179
I'm in the middle of
treating you right now.

303
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,315
Watch TV after I'm done, okay?

304
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,351
I told you, I'm not getting any
treatment from you!

305
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,954
Call Teacher Kim over here right now!

306
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,757
Do you know how much money
he's taken from me thus far?

307
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,294
And yet, he entrusted me to
someone like you?

308
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,864
Even someone like me can do
this much, at least.

309
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,999
I'll be examining you with
a stethoscope now.

310
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,769
Tell that punk Teacher Kim to
come here himself and do this!

311
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,572
You might have pneumonia right now!

312
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:07,941
What?

313
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,643
If you do have pneumonia, we have...

314
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,279
...to give you antibiotics and nip this
in the bud, Mr Chairman.

315
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,981
If not, we can't put you under
general anesthesia.

316
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,983
If we can't do that,
we can't perform surgery.

317
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,085
Wait, but that...

318
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,586
That's not all.

319
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,389
Do you know how much Teacher Kim
will yell at me if that happens?

320
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,624
I'll be called a fool who couldn't...

321
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,027
...even diagnose someone's pneumonia
and a completely idiotic quack.

322
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,962
Well, that is...

323
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,699
You've never heard Teacher Kim
go off on someone, have you?

324
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,603
The thing I hate the most is
having him go off on me.

325
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,838
So!

326
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,409
Please cooperate with me, here.

327
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,411
Please. Okay?

328
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,048
Geez...

329
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,195
I'll be examining you with
a stethoscope first, then.

330
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,255
Okay, take a deep breath.

331
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,560
And exhale.

332
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,430
One more time.

333
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,665
Inhale and exhale.

334
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,536
One more time.

335
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,672
Okay, let's take a look at your wound.

336
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,508
No! No!

337
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,144
I have to take a look for it to
stop hurting.

338
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:20,981
He was playing on the playground
and fell off a slide.

339
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,150
Did you fall on your head when you fell?

340
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:26,053
I think so. I'm not sure.

341
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,788
I didn't see him fall, either.

342
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,356
Your mother and father didn't
come with you?

343
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,325
Both of them are working.

344
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,728
My mom said she can only get
here after 7:00 PM.

345
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,032
Okay, let me take a look here.

346
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,236
-No! No!
-Oh, what a good boy!

347
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,443
Do you want this candy?

348
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,113
What, do you hate candy?

349
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,148
Give me two.

350
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:59,987
Well, if you can endure the
treatment like a champ, then...

351
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,455
Tada!

352
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,624
I'll give you two more.

353
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,061
We can take a look at
your wound now, right?

354
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:10,330
Here.

355
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,935
You sure are skilled, Nurse Oh.

356
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,904
This much is nothing.

357
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,041
Okay, let's take a look here then, okay?

358
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,210
Oh, what a good boy!

359
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,179
Okay, let me take a quick look here.

360
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,246
Geez.

361
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,951
We'll stitch up the wound first and
then take a CT scan of his brain.

362
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,619
Yes, Doctor.

363
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:37,558
Okay, there we go. Good boy!

364
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,729
Are you not feeling well?

365
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,334
Oh, I'm just a bit tired, is all.

366
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,102
Shall I call another doctor?

367
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:51,438
It's okay.

368
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,539
I'll do it.

369
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,503
It's true that he's been
overworking himself.

370
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:00,614
Yeah, that's true.

371
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,082
We have an emergency patient!

372
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:05,986
Don't die, okay?

373
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,321
Don't die! You can't die!

374
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,547
Please bring her to the back.

375
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,292
What happened?

376
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,239
She took some medication and
lost consciousness.

377
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,597
One, two, three!

378
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,399
Excuse me!

379
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,568
What's the problem?

380
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:23,504
My son has a severe fever.

381
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,172
Please come this way.

382
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,613
Nurse.

383
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,528
Pneumonia?

384
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:51,598
Yes. His cough doesn't sound good,
and his fever rose to 103.

385
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,668
I've also done a sputum smear examination
and a blood test on him, too.

386
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,036
Treat it as community-acquired...

387
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,905
...pneumonia for now and administer
some ceftriaxone to him.

388
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,173
Yes, sir.

389
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,242
Oh yeah. Here.

390
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,084
Here.

391
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,919
Oh, this is a different artificial heart
model than the one the chairman has.

392
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,489
The one that Chairman Shin has
is the A-Model.

393
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,258
There are many reports of that
model having issues.

394
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,005
There's talk of it being discontinued
soon.

395
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:25,265
Are you considering giving him a
new artificial heart, by any chance?

396
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,601
Just study up on those materials for now.

397
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:31,171
As for the rest, we'll discuss it in
detail at the meeting at 8:00 PM.

398
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:32,573
Yes, Doctor.

399
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:52,192
Man, this is going to be quite a task.

400
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:55,128
Dr Yoon! You're leaving already?

401
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:56,263
Is it 6:00 PM already?

402
00:24:57,197 --> 00:25:02,870
It's not, but my wife and her mother
are here, so I'm leaving a bit early.

403
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,906
But still, you should stay here until
6:00 PM, at least!

404
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,543
I'll be busy until then because of the
chairman's pneumonia diagnosis.

405
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,846
Dong-joo is in the ER now, actually,
so I asked him to help me out a bit.

406
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,481
Hey, I'm sorry.

407
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,817
But my mother-in-law is quite stern,
you see.

408
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:19,553
See?

409
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,088
It's her.

410
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,557
I'll only eat dinner and be right back!

411
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:25,025
I promise. My bad, Crazy Whale.

412
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,494
Yes, Mother-in-law? You're already here?

413
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,929
Yes, I'll run over right now!

414
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:31,798
Oh geez...

415
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,801
Of course he'd ask Kang Dong-joo and me.

416
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,609
Don't ask me to do it.

417
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:43,944
I'm not replacing you.

418
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:47,447
Hey, come on. Kang Dong-joo has
been on duty for three days straight!

419
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,693
Don't you feel bad for him?
He's your colleague, after all.

420
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:50,651
Nope.

421
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:51,618
Not at all.

422
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,820
I'll just check on Chairman Shin
and be right down.

423
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,489
So just until then. Please?

424
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,525
No. I'm busy, too.

425
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,062
Fine, then, you little brat...

426
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:03,964
Yes?

427
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,499
Oh, I'm coming up now.

428
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:06,667
Okay.

429
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,103
Don't you dare ask me to cover
your shift, ever...

430
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,538
I'll never do it.

431
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,125
What?

432
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,027
It's not just a simple battery...

433
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,607
...replacement surgery but he's
changing out the artificial heart?

434
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,699
I think that's the plan.

435
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,133
He must be out of his mind.

436
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,336
Looks like he's looking to cause trouble.

437
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,625
It appears that it'll be difficult to
perform the surgery right away.

438
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:50,878
It seems that Chairman Shin
has pneumonia.

439
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,313
That'll cause at least a two or three...

440
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,716
...day delay until they have it under
control, right?

441
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,650
Okay.

442
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:58,886
Keep updating me as
the situation changes.

443
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,290
So he's replacing the artificial heart?

444
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,962
Soo-Jung, are you okay?
Soo-Jung, wake up!

445
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,697
Soo-Jung, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

446
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:11,798
Excuse me!

447
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,133
Yes?

448
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,701
What medication did she take?

449
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:15,602
Did you bring it, by any chance?

450
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:16,509
Um, yes!

451
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,505
It's this one!

452
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,942
I think she took at least
a fistful of these.

453
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,517
What's your relationship to
the patient, sir?

454
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:32,019
I'm her boyfriend.

455
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,989
But... the two of us got into a fight.

456
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,193
So then, she...

457
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,994
Okay.

458
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,498
Could you step aside for a bit so
I can examine her?

459
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,600
Please come this way.

460
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,870
You can't die, Soo-Jung! Hang in there!

461
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,908
Miss. Please wake up now.

462
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,781
Open your eyes.

463
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,317
Your boyfriend is outside now.

464
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:12,092
You need to be honest with me
from this moment onward.

465
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,461
That's the only way I'll be able
to treat you properly.

466
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,232
How many of these did you take?

467
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:22,369
Are you going to tell my boyfriend?

468
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,539
No. I won't.

469
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:27,941
Two.

470
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:32,079
But I took them because my
stomach really was hurting.

471
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,580
Why did you lie, then?

472
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:36,650
We got into a fight, and he kept

473
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,453
saying "Let's die together,"
so I got mad.

474
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,155
But still, I'm not lying.

475
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,424
I really did take the medicine
because my stomach hurt.

476
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:47,728
Even if you two got into a fight,
things like this aren't going to help.

477
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:48,929
Do you understand?

478
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:51,265
Sorry.

479
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,368
I'll put an IV in you, so calm down
a bit before leaving.

480
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,069
Yes, Doctor.

481
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:01,008
Is she okay? She won't die, will she?

482
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,910
Her life isn't being threatened.

483
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:06,013
We're going to put an IV in her so
she can calm down a bit.

484
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,348
Oh, what a relief!

485
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,018
Oh, Soo-Jung! Soo-Jung!

486
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,287
I'm so sorry. I'll never do that again.

487
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:14,988
I'm really sorry, Soo-Jung.

488
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,294
Please put an IV in her.

489
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,261
Yes, Doctor.

490
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,796
Also, we have a patient with
a high fever over there.

491
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:25,023
His entire family seems like
they're not doing so well.

492
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,066
Okay.

493
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,668
Nurse Oh?

494
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:28,902
I am coming.

495
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:34,541
What brings you here today?

496
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,510
He's had a severe cough since yesterday.

497
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:41,915
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:44,785
We gave him medicine, but he's...

499
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,888
...not getting any better and his
condition is only getting worse.

500
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,293
All of you are coughing.

501
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,862
Since when have you had your coughs?

502
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,965
It's been about three or four days now.

503
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,033
I thought I was going to get better but...

504
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,769
...I ended up spreading it to my wife
and child.

505
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,240
I'll examine him with a stethoscope first.

506
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,142
Okay.

507
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,578
Take a deep breath in.

508
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:22,589
The sound in his lungs isn't good.

509
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,358
I'll be taking a scan of his lungs.

510
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:26,593
It's not... just a cold?

511
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:32,099
I'll also be examining you all, as well.

512
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,501
Could you sit down on the bed
behind you, please?

513
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:45,846
Okay, take a deep breath in.

514
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:55,889
Have all of you gone on a trip
somewhere recently?

515
00:30:55,956 --> 00:31:00,093
No. I just went on a business trip
abroad for about two months, is all.

516
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:01,995
Where abroad, exactly?

517
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:03,330
Saudi Arabia.

518
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,169
Saudi Arabia?

519
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:12,172
When did you get back?

520
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:20,180
It's been... about four days.

521
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,192
Could it be?

522
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,129
Nurse Oh, please see me for a bit.

523
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:16,370
Just listen quietly, please.

524
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,640
As of now, we're putting the ER
on lock down.

525
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:23,210
Dr Kang. What do you mean,
all of the sudden...

526
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,013
There are patients here whom
I suspect may have MERS.

527
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:29,683
Keep the suspected patients quarantined...

528
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,587
...in the hybrid room and we'll close off
the ER by following protocol.

529
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,690
Please prepare a guard for the
entrance of the hybrid room and...

530
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:39,660
...prepare plenty of face masks, gowns,
and disposable gloves.

531
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,195
Stay focused.

532
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:44,431
The faster we move,
the less disastrous this will be.

533
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:47,301
-Understand?
-Let's get some protective gear, first.

534
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:53,774
ER

535
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,814
Yes? This is Teacher Kim.

536
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,153
What?

537
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:39,553
You just need to stay in here until
we get the instructions.

538
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:00,674
What's going on?

539
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,675
A man went on a business trip to...

540
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,844
...Saudi Arabia and his family members
all have severe coughs.

541
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,479
They suspect that the family may
have MERS.

542
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,715
And Dr Kang Dong-joo just made
the decision to put the ER on lockdown.

543
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,284
How many people are in the ER right now?

544
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,152
We're not exactly sure how many
patients there are but as for staff,

545
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,255
there's Dr Kang, Nurse Oh, Nurse Park
Nurse Uhm, and Nurse Jung,

546
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,190
so five in total.

547
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:18,936
They've given them two doses of
mineral water and put masks on them.

548
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,169
Okay.

549
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,573
Hurry and contact the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention.

550
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,276
And ask the health center to send
us hazmat suits right away.

551
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,244
Yes, Doctor.

552
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:41,548
Also, please discharge any patient
that can be discharged immediately.

553
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,617
And let the hospitals nearby know
of this, as well.

554
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:44,618
Yes, sir.

555
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,989
Oh, Teacher Kim!

556
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,595
What's going on?

557
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,829
Did something happen?

558
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,499
It's terrible.

559
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:02,603
We have patients in the ER who
may have MERS.

560
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:11,979
His fever is going down.

561
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:13,445
His temperature is 102 now, Doctor.

562
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:18,018
We'll only know what caused this after
the test results come out but we've...

563
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,454
...started administering
an antibiotic to you.

564
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:23,957
If this antibiotic works well against
the bacteria, you'll get well soon.

565
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:29,162
If not, we'll check the test results
and administer another antibiotic.

566
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:33,534
Why hasn't that Teacher Kim
shown his face here yet?

567
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,904
He told me to come here,

568
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,972
yet he's acting like he's so busy.

569
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,642
Why would a doctor be busy?

570
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,410
It's because of his patient, of course.

571
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:48,148
I'm telling you, he's really busy
preparing for your surgery, Mr Chairman.

572
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,717
You sure are talkative.

573
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:55,355
You should've been a news anchor,
not a doctor.

574
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,124
I bet you'd be good at it.

575
00:35:58,192 --> 00:35:59,293
Oh, come now.

576
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,530
Despite how I may seem,
I'm actually not too talkative.

577
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:07,301
I'm actually quite introverted once
you get to know me, Grandpa.

578
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:09,503
What did you just say?

579
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,538
Oops. I mean, Mr Chairman.

580
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:16,243
We even got a new air purifier
just for you!

581
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,312
It can even expel hot air,
so be aware of that.

582
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,548
And it's a lot easier to use than
you'd think, too!

583
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,461
FROM DOLDAM ER: CODE GREEN

584
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,965
I have to step out for a bit.

585
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,518
Then get some rest, Grandpa.

586
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,270
I mean, Mr Chairman.

587
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:57,384
That woman is actually quite dumb
once you get to know her, huh?

588
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,752
Yes, I understand.

589
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,688
What's going on?

590
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,690
Why is there a code green in the ER?

591
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:07,794
They say that there's a patient who
could potentially have MERS in the ER.

592
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:14,368
They said that all of us are to maintain
our posts until commanded otherwise.

593
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,103
And you, of all people, are the...

594
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,605
...chairman's doctor so you must
be extra careful.

595
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:22,509
Dong-joo is in the ER now, actually,
so I asked him to help me out a bit.

596
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,412
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!
Are you listening to me?

597
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:29,383
Dong-joo is in the ER now, actually,
so I asked him to help me out a bit.

598
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:30,884
Dr Yoon!

599
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,835
Oh, Kang Dong-joo...

600
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,665
Dong-joo.

601
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:29,376
Kang Dong-joo.

602
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,115
Get away from the door.

603
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:43,724
Don't come anywhere near the ER.

604
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:45,225
Are...

605
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,794
...you okay?

606
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,962
Why do you look so pale?
Are you feeling sick?

607
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm fine, so...

608
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,905
Hurry up and get away from here!

609
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,506
Kang Dong-joo.

610
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:01,208
Dr Kang!

611
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,214
Hurry and go.

612
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,329
Kang Dong-joo!

613
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:40,447
Did you get in touch with the
health center?

614
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:41,715
When are the hazmat suits getting here?

615
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,350
About that, Teacher Kim...

616
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,419
They're not picking up.

617
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:50,958
JUNGSUNGU HEALTH CENTER

618
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:59,766
I think everyone's left work for the day.

619
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,872
And you contacted the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention?

620
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:05,973
Yes, I did.

621
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:06,940
I did...

622
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:10,301
but they just keep telling us to
move the patient to a designated hospital.

623
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,379
Call them one more time.
Hurry and call them!

624
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:13,380
Yes, Doctor!

625
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,682
Oh, yes.

626
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,718
I heard the news before.

627
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:21,688
But are you sure that they really
have MERS?

628
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:25,559
Hey, you people are the ones who
should be making sure of that!

629
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:30,330
So move the patient to one of our
designated hospitals first.

630
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:33,600
We've given that hospital everything
they'll need to treat this so if you...

631
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,735
...just send the patients over.

632
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:37,004
We have three patients here.

633
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:40,207
How are we supposed to move all of them?

634
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:44,077
If you can't do anything through the
health center, just call 911!

635
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:48,415
There's only one ambulance
designated to our area, though!

636
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:50,450
Are you telling us to take
one patient at a time?

637
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:51,985
And go back and forth from that...

638
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:54,665
...Gang-neung hospital three times when
it takes over two hours to get there?

639
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,490
Is that what you're telling us to
do all night?

640
00:40:56,557 --> 00:41:02,162
If you think it'll be hard with just one
ambulance, you can call a general one.

641
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:04,498
Stop it with that nonsense, already!

642
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:11,038
If you want to move a MERS patient,
those workers need hazmat suits, too!

643
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:14,474
But you're refusing to give us any hazmat
suits and we don't even have any front...

644
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:19,379
...facing protective gear yet you're
telling us to call a general ambulance?

645
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:20,814
Okay, Doctor.

646
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:27,020
As I said before we've put all the
supplies at our designated hospital.

647
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,022
All you have to do is get them there.

648
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:33,727
What I'm saying right now is that
moving them is the issue, here!

649
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:38,365
Why can't you understand what
the heck I'm saying, here?

650
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:39,733
"What the heck"...

651
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,103
Did you just speak informally to me?

652
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:47,274
Hey, we need to try and cooperate
to find a way together!

653
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:50,043
You think everything will be solved
just because of your yelling?

654
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,178
Oh, whatever!

655
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,513
I'm hanging up, you jerk!

656
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:55,482
Wow, you sure are harsh with
your words...

657
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:56,483
Hello?

658
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:59,086
"Doldam Hospital"?

659
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,654
Who was that?

660
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:01,722
Teacher Kim.

661
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:05,259
We've discharged all the patients on
the second floor that could be discharged.

662
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:08,128
You get the situation in
the ER under control.

663
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:09,596
I'll take care of everything upstairs.

664
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:11,298
-I'll leave it to you, sir.
-Okay.

665
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:13,767
Teacher Kim.

666
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,803
Hey, why did you come down here?

667
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,340
Didn't you hear that I told everyone
to stay at their posts?

668
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:24,044
What will happen to the people who
are in there now?

669
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,879
What have you decided to do?

670
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,321
I'm in talks with the health center
right now so...

671
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,690
...hurry and go upstairs
to maintain your post!

672
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:48,669
This is the ER.

673
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:52,206
How's the situation in there, Nurse Oh?

674
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:55,943
Teacher Kim.

675
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:03,217
We've moved the patients who may
have MERS into the hybrid room...

676
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,890
...and we've closed the entire room
off with plastic curtains.

677
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,487
What about the other patients?

678
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,723
I haven't been able to tell them
the news yet.

679
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,393
I feel that it would become quite
chaotic if they were to find out.

680
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,597
But still, it'd be good to explain
the situation to the patients.

681
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:20,667
Draw blood from the patients
who may have MERS.

682
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,971
Put it into test tubes and
send them out here.

683
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,272
We'll need to do a lot of legwork...

684
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:29,409
...after you send out the samples
to the team at the station.

685
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,178
And then...

686
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,285
...that entire ER will
have to be quarantined off.

687
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,225
And we'll have to keep these...

688
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:48,629
...measures in place until we have
definitive results.

689
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,699
Yes, I understand.

690
00:43:57,571 --> 00:44:02,042
Don't worry too much about what's
going on in here, Teacher Kim.

691
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:05,445
I'll do my very best.

692
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,522
Nurse Oh...

693
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,184
KANG DONG-JOO

694
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,049
SEO-JUNG

695
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,000
You're not going to pick up the phone?

696
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,410
It seemed like that was Dr Yoon.

697
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:56,330
Only Nurse Park and I will be going
into the hybrid room for now.

698
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,532
No, I'll go in.

699
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,200
No, I'll go in with Nurse Park.

700
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,215
-That's okay with you, right?
-Of course.

701
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,240
At the very least, I have very strong
immune system, Nurse Oh.

702
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:08,575
Let's go in.

703
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:17,818
What's going on here?

704
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,254
Did we do something terribly wrong?

705
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,095
Sir.

706
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,632
You've heard of MERS, correct?

707
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:38,906
Doctor, are you telling us that
we may have MERS?

708
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:42,376
MERS symptoms are sometimes
similar to those of a common cold.

709
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:44,202
So it's hard to tell the two apart
sometimes.

710
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:49,550
But you, sir, have gone to an area
that's plagued with MERS so there...

711
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,652
...are plenty of reasons
for us to have our suspicions.

712
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:52,686
Oh no!

713
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,290
Then, are we going to die?

714
00:45:56,356 --> 00:45:58,625
Not everyone who gets MERS dies.

715
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,030
Furthermore, we haven't made a
definitive diagnosis yet.

716
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:04,865
So please don't worry too much.

717
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:07,234
But first, we'll start with
a basic examination.

718
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:11,839
We'll be doing a blood test and
sputum culture as well as a chest x-ray.

719
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:16,643
Please hand them cups to collect
the sputum samples.

720
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:19,313
We'll be running a CBC test, a blood

721
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:21,849
chemistry screen an ABGA, and
a chest x-ray.

722
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:22,883
Yes, Doctor.

723
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,055
Please take one each.

724
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:33,260
SEO-JUNG

725
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,429
The person you're calling is unavailable.

726
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:50,944
Nurse Oh.

727
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:53,213
Dr Kang isn't looking too good.

728
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:55,649
I think it would be good
to have him rest a bit.

729
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,499
What's going on?

730
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,926
What's with everyone in the ER,
all of the sudden?

731
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,815
I'm sorry ma'am, but our hospital is
no longer accepting patients today.

732
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:30,350
Please return home.

733
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:33,320
I heard that my kids are here.

734
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,255
My7-year-old boy.

735
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:39,159
I heard he came to this ER because
he hurt his head.

736
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,195
The ER?

737
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,063
Oh, um...

738
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,599
What are you saying?

739
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,639
What do you mean she can't be discharged?

740
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,703
Why can't we leave?

741
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:54,975
Sir, we have patients whom we
suspect may have MERS in there.

742
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,009
What?

743
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:57,878
MERS?

744
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,719
MERS?

745
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:09,623
So what you're saying is that all of
the people in there have MERS?

746
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,690
Every single one of them?

747
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,560
We can't be sure yet.
We just think that may be the case.

748
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:16,797
So all you need to do is return to
your spot and follow our orders.

749
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:18,866
What are you saying?

750
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,201
You should've let us all
escape first, then!

751
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:23,437
How could you lock us all in with
those people there?

752
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:25,272
Are you trying to kill us all?

753
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:26,373
People from the health center will...

754
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,443
...come to escort everyone home
individually.

755
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,647
So until then, you cannot leave of
your own accord.

756
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:35,749
I am so speechless.

757
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:43,690
Honey!

758
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,359
Ugh, darn it!

759
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,098
Sir.

760
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:52,499
Sir!

761
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:54,968
Sir, stop it!

762
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:57,504
Stop it, already, and go
back to your spot!

763
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:01,108
Get out of my way. Get away, now!

764
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,678
Why should I have to stay here with
people who have MERS?

765
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,080
Get out of the way.

766
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,081
Open the door!

767
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:10,350
There are children in here right
now, too!

768
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:13,587
Stop yelling and making them feel
more uncomfortable.

769
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,289
And please follow our orders.

770
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:16,790
I said open the door!

771
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,330
I'm sorry, sir, but please stop being
a nuisance and return to your spot.

772
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:25,032
If not, the situation may grow
even worse.

773
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,000
Why, you little brats...

774
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,001
Honey!

775
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:32,739
Honey!

776
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:33,941
Soo-Jung.

777
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,745
What's the matter, huh? What's wrong?

778
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,214
What's wrong, miss?

779
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,516
-Where does it hurt?
-My stomach.

780
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:45,586
Oh, it hurts so much!

781
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,754
Please lie flat.

782
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,456
And prop her legs up.

783
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:53,227
I'm going to press on
your belly for a bit.

784
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:57,197
Is this where it hurts?

785
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,398
Just a little.

786
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:02,870
But when you press there,
my right side hurts more.

787
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:05,405
The right side?

788
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:08,342
What about here?

789
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:12,646
This time, I'm going to press down
for a bit, and then take my hand off.

790
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,113
Please bear with me for just a bit.

791
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:32,599
What? Acute appendicitis?

792
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:33,834
Yes.

793
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:37,504
She's exhibiting rebound tenderness,
Rovsing's sign, and Dunphy's sign.

794
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:39,473
Okay, get ready for an operation first.

795
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:41,708
-We'll be doing an operation.
-Yes, Doctor.

796
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:45,412
Do you think the patient will be okay
until the hazmat suits get here?

797
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:48,081
I'm not sure yet, sir.

798
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,351
We'll have to keep watching over
her to find out.

799
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:54,955
If the situation becomes any direr,
call me right away. Got it?

800
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:56,156
Yes, sir.

801
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:04,203
Nurse Oh.

802
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,700
Give her one dose of
tramadol via IV, please.

803
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,001
Yes, Doctor.

804
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,340
Dr Kang!

805
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:27,020
Geez, you surprised me!

806
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,535
We have an acute appendicitis
patient in the ER right now.

807
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,358
Get ready to go into the OR.

808
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,225
It's been a while since my office
hours ended.

809
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,396
If it implodes, the situation can
grow worse.

810
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,398
So let's prevent that from happening
while we can.

811
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:40,834
Think of the situation we're in right now.

812
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:42,536
Why would we open up the stomach...

813
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,238
...of a person who may have been
exposed to MERS?

814
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:45,205
They are not in the incubation period,

815
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:49,176
so it's not transmissible yet and you
have no chance of getting MERS!

816
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:52,713
At any rate, I don't want to.
I refuse to do that surgery.

817
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:55,082
Hey!

818
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,818
Doctors are people too, you know!

819
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:00,888
Doctors can get sick and get MERS, too!

820
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:03,223
And I don't want to say this,
but doctors can die, too!

821
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,291
You know that?

822
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:07,194
I have the right to want to protect
my own life, too.

823
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:08,962
What's wrong with you?

824
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:10,998
Fine, you're right.

825
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:14,067
Everything you said is right.

826
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,203
So hurry up and get ready to
perform surgery!

827
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:23,277
Ugh, seriously!

828
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:27,948
Tell them to give us
some protection, at least!

829
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:29,983
Teacher Kim! Teacher Kim!

830
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,718
What now? What is it now?

831
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:33,420
Dr Kang Dong-joo is...

832
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,625
Are you okay, Dr Kang?

833
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,163
I'm fine.

834
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,198
I'm okay.

835
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:45,599
This isn't good.

836
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,135
Please stop working and get some
rest, Dr Kang.

837
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:50,871
I can handle this much, Nurse Oh.

838
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,556
-Dr Kang!
-Dr Kang!

839
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:29,109
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!

840
00:53:32,813 --> 00:53:34,014
Kang Dong-joo!

841
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,290
No. You mustn't go in.

842
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:44,558
Dr Kang!

843
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:47,594
Wake up, Dr Kang!

844
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:48,862
Dr Kang!

845
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:56,403
Hello?

846
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,337
Teacher Kim!

847
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,906
Dr Kang has lost consciousness.

848
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,909
His pulse is weak, and he has a fever!

849
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:04,444
What do we do, Teacher Kim?

850
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:06,146
Give us an order!

851
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:13,220
Okay. Put him on a bed first and
check his vitals.

852
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:17,925
I'll call you right back.

853
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:19,593
Move him to a bed.

854
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,561
Yes, ma'am.

855
00:54:32,306 --> 00:54:33,841
I knew this would happen.

856
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:37,845
I knew you'd send another one
to the afterlife.

857
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,487
Mr Go.

858
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:52,292
Get me a surgical mask and a gown.

859
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:54,928
I'm going in.

860
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:10,077
What... did you just say?

861
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:12,746
Kang Dong-joo passed out?

862
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,548
Yes.

863
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,416
His condition isn't looking too good.

864
00:55:18,886 --> 00:55:20,287
So?

865
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:22,222
Who went into the ER just now?

866
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,191
Nobody yet.

867
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:25,592
What do you mean, nobody?

868
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,328
There's no doctor in the ER, then?

869
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:31,698
What about Kang Dong-joo, then?

870
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:33,834
Who's taking care of Kang Dong-joo now?

871
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,470
Wake up, Dr Kang.

872
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:39,973
Dr Kang.

873
00:55:40,307 --> 00:55:41,508
Dr Kang!

874
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:44,344
His vitals aren't looking good, Nurse Oh.

875
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:48,715
Dr Kang.

876
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,622
You can't, Teacher Kim.

877
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,061
This isn't the time to be arguing
about that, Director Yeo.

878
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:03,781
You're the control tower at our
hospital right now, Teacher Kim!

879
00:56:03,964 --> 00:56:07,501
So what are we to do if you make
this emotion driven decision? Huh?

880
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,169
What happened with the health center?

881
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:11,438
One of our employees is heading
there now.

882
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:12,973
Hey, Chief Song!

883
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:15,976
Get ready to perform surgery when
the hazmat suits get here.

884
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,979
Why are you doing this to me?
I told you, I'm not doing that surgery!

885
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:22,950
How dare you, as a doctor, try to run
away now to save your own skin?

886
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:28,488
How could you say that, when one of
your younger colleagues has passed out?

887
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:36,363
Darn it!

888
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,131
Please reconsider.

889
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:39,810
You have the chairman's surgery
coming up.

890
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,934
If you do this now...

891
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,904
There's a saying for situations like this.

892
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:48,375
"Patients need to be treated based
on how much they need attention..."

893
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:50,122
"...not in the order that they showed up."

894
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:54,014
The patient that needs our care the
most right now isn't Chairman Shin.

895
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,521
Rather, it's the patients in the ER.

896
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,621
I'll be going in, then.

897
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:06,727
I'll go in, Doctor.

898
00:57:08,695 --> 00:57:10,097
I'll go inside.

899
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:12,199
Please allow me to go in.

900
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:13,600
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

901
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:17,771
I told you to stay at your post.

902
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:19,339
Hurry up and get upstairs.

903
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,109
I've put him in the care of someone else.

904
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:34,354
I'm Do In-bum.

905
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:38,325
I'll be taking care of you in
Dr Yoon Seo-jung's stead.

906
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:45,999
Geez...

907
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:48,653
Who gave you permission to make
that kind of decision?

908
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,170
Are you in charge of me now?

909
00:57:50,237 --> 00:57:54,408
The person who should be there
isn't a surgeon, but an ER specialist.

910
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:56,610
You may be triple board certified,

911
00:57:56,677 --> 00:58:02,316
but the doctor that the people in
there need is me.

912
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:10,090
If we definitively prove that those
patients have MERS,

913
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:14,228
you may not be able to partake in
the cardiothoracic surgery.

914
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:17,397
Are you aware of that?

915
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:19,933
Yes, I am.

916
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:34,648
I will go in.

917
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,085
Please allow me to go in.

918
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:03,110
There have been some problems at
the hospital, Mr Chairman.

919
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:05,245
When are you going to tell
Teacher Kim, Mr Chairman?

920
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:08,815
Don't say anything until
the surgery is over.

921
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:09,950
Who's the doctor in charge of him?

922
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,151
Someone called Teacher Kim.

923
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:12,486
You mean that crazy man?

924
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,822
Why did he do that when he knew so well?

925
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,090
I'm fine.

926
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:20,661
I've never expected anything
from you, Dr Yoon.

927
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:23,664
And I heard your answer just before, too.

928
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,033
Everything else is fine.

929
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:35,089
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
