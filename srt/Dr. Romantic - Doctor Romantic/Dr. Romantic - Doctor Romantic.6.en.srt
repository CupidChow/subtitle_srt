1
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,570
What's your name...?

2
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,570
Yoon Seo-jung.

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Seo-jung, huh?

4
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,310
You must have been quite shocked.

5
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
But how did you know to contact me?

6
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,440
If anything happens to me,

7
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,519
contact Dr Do Yoon-wan,

8
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,771
the Deputy Director of Geosan Hospital.

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,610
He will surely take good care of you.

10
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,169
Are you my father, by any chance?

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,795
Are... you my father?

12
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,700
Director Do Yoon-wan is his father,
you see.

13
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,910
How unexpected...

14
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,623
You went ahead and introduced me,
even though I didn't even ask you to.

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,781
Is he doing well?

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,010
Does he feel good about himself
after sending me to this place?

17
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,280
There's no reason why he wouldn't.

18
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,290
It's not like you're anybody significant.

19
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,230
I know.

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,900
So I don't know why
he left a VIP's surgery in my hands

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,202
and made a laughingstock out of me.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,697
It's not like I'm anybody significant.

23
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,770
Why are you blaming others

24
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,970
when you tripped on your huge ego
and landed here?

25
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,330
How could I avoid a trap
that was laid out for me?

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,280
You should've judged for yourself

27
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,810
whether it was a surgery
you could handle.

28
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,440
As you know, Geosan is not a place
that allows for personal judgement.

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,050
Are you insulting my father right now?

30
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,320
So why did you come
all the way here and piss me off?

31
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,540
Like you said, I'm nobody.

32
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,365
It's been a while.

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,480
You don't remember me?

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,225
Wait, you know him?

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,392
It's been quite a while
since we've seen each other, right?

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,070
Wait a second.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,308
You were "seeing him"?

38
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,700
Hi!

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm Yoon Seo-jung.

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,560
It's nice to meet you.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,970
Consider her to be
your older sister from now on.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,480
Okay?

43
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,907
Sorry, but I don't remember.

44
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,190
I know.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,179
I almost didn't recognize you, either.

46
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,043
The director is doing well, right?

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,270
I haven't been in touch
with him for so long, so...

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,420
I haven't been able to see him much
since I'm really busy with work, too.

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,960
Oh, I see.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,671
I never expected that
you'd become a doctor, though.

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,240
By the way...

52
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,500
Where's the way out of
this place, anyway?

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm going to go and
give the director my regards later.

54
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,140
Keep it a secret that
you saw me until then, okay?

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,214
Okay?

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,080
What in the world is going on, here?

57
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,380
Where and how did you meet him?

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,190
You didn't, like, meet him on
an arranged date or something, did you?

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,090
You must be really tired, huh?

60
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,540
What?

61
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,470
Dr Yoon!

62
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,110
Stop with your nonsense, and go to sleep.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Tell me the truth!

64
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,410
I'll go to sleep after you tell me.

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,370
Leave.

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Just give up on doing that surgery.

67
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,123
I'm telling you, Director Do will do
anything to stop that surgery.

68
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,299
You've gone through

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,220
the trouble of changing your name
and coming to Doldam.

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,014
Don't ruin what you've
created for yourself here

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,519
and just continue to live quietly
as you have until now. Okay?

72
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,559
That would be the best thing
for you to do.

73
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,697
Just what does that
mean for a doctor, anyway?

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,065
What else?

75
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,930
It's making a living through
your license to practice.

76
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,600
But man cannot live on
what you eat alone.

77
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,150
Life isn't fun without a bit of power
and authority and getting yourself

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,830
a nice position to show off
to the rest of the world.

79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,540
In other words, looking for
justice without any morals?

80
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,880
The ability-to-ability principle
with no target?

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,810
And rationalism without justification?

82
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,120
Well, sure.

83
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,260
I guess I remember doing well for myself,

84
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,618
if that's what you mean.

85
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,900
So...

86
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,820
That's why...

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,521
I really can't give up on
doing this surgery now.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,570
What?

89
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,130
Didn't you say that
he's the chairman of the board?

90
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,450
I'm sure that he's perfect
for my home-coming gift.

91
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,066
Dr Yoon!

92
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,800
Go and tell Do Yoon-wan this.

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,480
That I'm going to get involved in
doing some lucrative things, too.

94
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,593
Okay?

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,317
A time in which all values
fall by the wayside.

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,490
Hey, Dong-joo!

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,420
You haven't left yet?

98
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,100
People who have lost their way chasing
the ideology known as "success."

99
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,540
DIRECTOR DO YOON-WAN

100
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,750
People whose perceived value
of themselves has decreased

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,150
due to wanting acknowledgment
from others so badly.

102
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,400
Seoul, please...

103
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,430
What?

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,330
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

105
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,500
Sure.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,570
Those who have forgotten

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,110
what it means to really live
due to being so bogged down by life

108
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,610
and are unaware of
what it means to truly live.

109
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,150
I'm telling you, this gets at all
my sore spots like nothing else.

110
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,370
What's that?

111
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,100
Give us one more ultrasound machine
to use in the ER

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,140
and you'll have to get us
a new CT machine, too.

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,270
Also, I'd like to take this opportunity
to add another portable x-ray machine.

114
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,310
What kind of deal is
so complicated and messy?

115
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,585
You should just go by the terms
that we agreed to at the start.

116
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,460
I heard that you're the chairman
of the board

117
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,177
of the Geosan Hospital Foundation.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,849
So what?

119
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,430
You allowed scum like Do Yoon-wan
to become the director

120
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,430
and you've made a profit
off the sick and helpless.

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
So, I can't do the surgery
without more in return.

122
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,960
I have to take this opportunity to
benefit from this as much as I can.

123
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,730
What makes you think that
it's okay to be this arrogant?

124
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,800
Nothing, really.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,870
I just...have a "painting"
that I wish to "paint," that's all.

126
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,090
CHAPTER 6
Motivation

127
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,190
Are you feeling better now?

128
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,530
Can you fill in
your personal information here?

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,060
We need your name, resident number,

130
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,370
and contact information.

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,240
Bring him here immediately,
before we get angrier.

132
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,138
What's going on?

133
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,690
They're the guardians of
the bike accident patient.

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,810
They've all been transferred
to a hospital in Seoul.

135
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,860
No.

136
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,250
Why not? I'm telling you.

137
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,220
I can't leave them in this decrepit,
countryside place for one more second!

138
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,620
The patient is recovering from a surgery,
so he needs to rest.

139
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,870
So who the heck told you that
you could operate on my brother?

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,840
Huh?

141
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,428
I'm sorry!

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,140
They told me that he was
in a really bad state...

143
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,400
-I was...
-Don't say anything.

144
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,640
I'm on close terms with people
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,450
If you make a single misstep,

146
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,190
I won't leave the doctors
or this hospital alone!

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,110
You got that?

148
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,350
Look here, sir!

149
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,098
You think we operated on the patient
for our own amusement?

150
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,156
Who the heck are you, Miss?

151
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,690
I'm not a "Miss." I'm a doctor.

152
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,130
Your older brother was suffering
from tons of blood loss

153
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,940
and would've been in danger
if he didn't receive surgery.

154
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,980
Oh, so you performed the surgery
on my brother, Miss?

155
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,710
I told you, not "Miss." I'm a doctor.

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,742
I asked if you were the one
who performed the surgery!

157
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,443
If you weren't, then piss off!

158
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,550
Bring me a real doctor!

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,580
Immediately!

160
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,374
-Look at you!
-Wait.

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,250
Please step outside, both of you.

162
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,810
This is an ER, and there are
patients being treated here.

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,856
-If you'd wait outside...
-How dare you touch me?

164
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,116
Did you just hit me?

165
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,800
Yeah, I did.
What are you going to do about it?

166
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,730
Huh?

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,800
Who the heck do you think you are,
telling me to leave?

168
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,809
Do you know who the heck I am?

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,700
Hey!

170
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,380
If I make a single call to my contact

171
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,290
at the Ministry of Health and Welfare,

172
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,420
all of you will be done for!

173
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,350
Got that?

174
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,710
Is that right?

175
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,215
Of course!

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,730
I see.

177
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,660
Then...

178
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,784
call them.

179
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,070
What?

180
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,696
Call the Ministry of Health and Welfare,
or wherever

181
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,504
and then give the phone to me!

182
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,498
I need to know what "high-level contact"
knows a rude asshole like you!

183
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,511
I'm going to find out who it is

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,253
and report such corrupt people
to the Prime Minister!

185
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,276
And who else, again?

186
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,580
-The Blue House's Public Service Center.
-Yeah!

187
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,070
The Blue House's Public Service Center!

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,420
I'll report all those jerks

189
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,180
and get them all fired

190
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,251
so call him.

191
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,632
Why can't you make the call?

192
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,927
I thought you said that
you knew someone powerful there.

193
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,510
Call him now!

194
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,427
Want me to dial the Ministry of
Health and Welfare for you?

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,419
Shall I?

196
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,185
Get out of my way!

197
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,690
Geez... you tiny little...

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,246
Oh, I guess I'll have to call, then!

199
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,930
Be gentle, okay?

200
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,610
There are always psychos like that guy.

201
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,970
They need to get it together.

202
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,190
But still, I shouldn't
have gotten so angry.

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,010
If you didn't get mad, I would have.

204
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,768
This is the 21st century!

205
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,380
How dare he threaten us
with such a thing?

206
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,390
What about Dr Kang?

207
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,300
The chief of the surgical department
at his hospital in Seoul came by.

208
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,632
So he's going to be out for a bit.

209
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,000
Wait, so he's not
in the hospital right now?

210
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,460
No, he's not.

211
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,840
What should we do?

212
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,660
Should we call Teacher Kim for now?

213
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,860
He's not here.

214
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,949
-Pardon?
-He's not here, either.

215
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,970
He left for a bit because he thought
Dr Kang would hold down the fort.

216
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,767
Then... what about the ER?

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,055
OH MYUNG-SHIM

218
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,936
He's not picking up?

219
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,590
No. What about Dr Kang?

220
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,823
What is he doing?
Why isn't he picking up?

221
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,240
Geez... the fermented
soy crabs are so good.

222
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,351
I wonder if they're caught in the wild.

223
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,870
Here, have a drink.

224
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,665
I have to go back to the hospital.

225
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,280
There's a patient I performed surgery on.

226
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,959
Just let me pour you a drink, at least.

227
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,410
When did you find out that
Teacher Kim was Bu Yong-ju?

228
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,071
Bu Yong-ju?

229
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,398
You mean the Bu Yong-ju we know?

230
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,002
The one who was a legend
among the surgeons?

231
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,180
When did you find this out?

232
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,144
Right before I spoke
with you on the phone, sir.

233
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,700
Do you know
why he was kicked out of Geosan?

234
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,044
Wait, he was kicked out?

235
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,002
He didn't leave on his own?

236
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,960
But why?

237
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,400
Because he killed a person.

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,206
And it was a disciple of his, who was
fiercely loyal to him, of all people.

239
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,070
He doesn't deserve to be called a doctor,

240
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,210
or even a human being.

241
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,260
He became so surgery crazy
that he even operated on patients

242
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,743
who didn't need surgery
and shoved his knife at them!

243
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,750
In other words...

244
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,860
he's nothing short of a psychopath.

245
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,150
Hey, what's going on?

246
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,536
Did something piss you off?

247
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,880
A "painting" that you want to "paint"?

248
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,581
You're not asking me to open
a hospital for you now, are you?

249
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,813
Well, would you even do that,
if I asked you?

250
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,790
You're crossing a line...

251
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,500
Find someone else
if you're not happy with that.

252
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,790
You have tons of money, after all.

253
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,130
Hey...

254
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,540
Hey, come on.

255
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,922
Be careful, okay?

256
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,770
Welcome!

257
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,290
Why are you telling me this?

258
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,310
To be honest,

259
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,950
when I heard that Bu Yong-ju was
going to be your mentor,

260
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,850
I couldn't help but feel like
I'd lose a good guy to him.

261
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,420
So, Dong-joo.

262
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,130
I know how you must
feel more than anyone else.

263
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,400
But be careful!

264
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
That Teacher Kim guy...

265
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,470
he's not even a human being.

266
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,700
If you get involved with him,
it'll all be over for you in an instant.

267
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,940
How strange!
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

268
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,510
Do you think that something
may have happened?

269
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,383
Nurse Oh! Here.

270
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,945
Teacher Kim left
his cellphone in his office.

271
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,570
Maybe Dr Kang left his phone behind, too?

272
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,022
Oh, no way.

273
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,260
He... wouldn't have.

274
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,810
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure nothing will happen.

275
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,740
It's not like we have any emergency case.

276
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,700
An emergency case!

277
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,740
Did you hear that, Dr Yoon?

278
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,646
Yes I did, Nurse Oh.

279
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,029
Tell me about the patient.

280
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,630
He's in his 40s. He suddenly collapsed.

281
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,164
He's sweating profusely, and has a fever!

282
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,270
Do In-bum!

283
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,923
He was driving the taxi
that I was riding in.

284
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,870
Patient!

285
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,040
Can you hear me?

286
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,299
Patient.

287
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,150
-His vitals?
-BP is 80/40, with 130 bpm.

288
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,235
Body temperature is 103.64 ºF.

289
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,520
Maybe it's septic shock? .

290
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,944
I checked his chest before,
and he has severe muscle guarding.

291
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,520
What are you doing?

292
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,383
You're not going to make any orders?

293
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,410
I can't allow you to treat patients yet.

294
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,400
I need to make sure that

295
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,595
it's okay for me to
entrust patients to you.

296
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,430
You're not going to give any orders?

297
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,546
Dr Yoon.

298
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,737
Are you really not going to perform
the surgery on the chairman?

299
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,531
Well, that depends on
what the chairman decides to do.

300
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,329
You said there was a "painting"
that you wanted to "paint."

301
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,211
Then you need to get the chairman
on your side, at the very least.

302
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,821
If it happens, it happens.
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

303
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm not the one to try and
make people take my side and such.

304
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,170
If you give up on doing
the surgery like this now,

305
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,903
the person who will be most pleased
is Director Do Yoon-wan.

306
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,140
Isn't that right?

307
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,010
Sure, I don't care...

308
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,586
This is the management plan.

309
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,550
Do Yoon-wan submitted
to the chairman for next year.

310
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,090
I'm curious to know if you'll still be
so apathetic after reading this.

311
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,310
I'll be going now.

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,340
What? Already?

313
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,070
Hey, come on, Dong-joo!

314
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,510
Have a safe trip back to Seoul.

315
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,799
Think about this carefully, Dong-joo.

316
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,460
You have to carefully decide
which side you'll take.

317
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,313
Got it?

318
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,070
13 MISSED CALLS
Doldam Hospital ER, Seo-jung

319
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,820
It's me, Dr Yoon.

320
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,100
Hey, Kang Dong-joo! Where are you?

321
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,750
Why didn't you pick up any of my calls?

322
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,322
What is it? What happened?

323
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,800
A patient is complaining
about his stomachache.

324
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,670
His vitals are getting worse,
and he has a fever.

325
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,170
I think it's peritonitis.

326
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,127
What should I do?

327
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,170
It'll take me at least
40 minutes to get there.

328
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,810
No. If you don't get here in 10 minutes,
the patient will die, and so will I!

329
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,689
You have to take a plane or something
and fly here right now.

330
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,891
What about Teacher Kim?

331
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,620
He's not at the hospital?

332
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,043
He left thinking that you were here.

333
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,351
What should I do?

334
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,960
You really can't get here
within 10 minutes?

335
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,060
Darn it, this is driving me crazy!

336
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Hello?

337
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,070
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!

338
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,200
Did he hang up? Hello?

339
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,760
Hello?

340
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,900
You do it, Dr Yoon.

341
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,230
What are you saying? Right now, I...

342
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,770
I can't do that right now. You know that.

343
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,710
What are we supposed to do, then?

344
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,810
Neither Teacher Kim nor I are there.
Only you are.

345
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,690
Do you really want to
let the patient die like this?

346
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,950
Are you serious right now?

347
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,280
What do you mean, let him die?
Why would I do that?

348
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,050
That's why I'm telling you to do it now!

349
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,260
You're the one who was originally
in charge of the ER.

350
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,990
Give me 30 minutes.

351
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,570
I'll get there in 30 minutes
no matter what

352
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,330
so just keep the patient alive
and breathing until then.

353
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,746
Taxi!

354
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,340
Dr Yoon.

355
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,310
Dr Yoon?

356
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,650
What are you doing right now?

357
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,950
Aren't you going to treat the patient?

358
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,280
Can't you see that
his condition is getting worse?

359
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,660
Listen, aren't you a doctor?

360
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,247
Aren't you a doctor?

361
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,570
I can't entrust a patient to
a doctor who harmed herself.

362
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,300
As of today, you're no longer
qualified to work here.

363
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,610
That's why you need to do it, Dr Yoon!

364
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,810
You're the one who was
originally in charge of the ER.

365
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,142
Put a mask on him. Seven liters of gas.

366
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,570
Put two lines in him
and give him a 1liter drip.

367
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,290
-And prepare a saline, as well.
-Yes, Doctor.

368
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,866
I'll do an ultrasound.

369
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,520
The saline is ready.

370
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,250
32mg through the saline, please.

371
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,810
Mix the ODW and give him 10cc per hour.

372
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,670
-And put a Foley in him, please.
-Yes, Doctor.

373
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,337
His heart rate is dropping, Doctor Yoon.

374
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,242
All I need to do is adjust this.

375
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,720
He's going into cardiac arrest.
He needs CPR!

376
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,953
Can you perform
some compression on him, Dr Do In-bum?

377
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,056
I hurt my wrist, so I can't. Please.

378
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,810
1mg of epinephrine
every three minutes, please.

379
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,970
Let's intubate him.

380
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,490
I'll check his heartbeat.

381
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,450
Oh, wait.

382
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,642
His pulse is back.
It's a return of spontaneous circulation.

383
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,300
His BP is 80/50.

384
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,160
-Please hurry and get him hooked up.
-Yes, ma'am.

385
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,571
What's that piece of junk?

386
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,510
Is that his gallbladder?

387
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,384
Yep, that's his gallbladder.

388
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,880
It looks like it's going to burst.

389
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,550
Maybe it's a gallbladder empyema?

390
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,610
A gallbladder empyema?

391
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,450
Get him ready for emergency surgery
right away, Nurse Park.

392
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,745
-And call Dr Nam Do-il.
-Yes, Doctor.

393
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
Teacher Kim!

394
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,897
It's an emergency call.

395
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,910
Kang Dong-joo needs to do
another emergency surgery.

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,904
You're not going to go?

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,204
Okay, then. Make sure you
turn off the flame in 10 minutes, okay?

398
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,680
And don't let the stock reduce to
nothing like last time.

399
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,520
Geez... Kang Dong-joo.

400
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,280
He sure has it rough.

401
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,950
He's been so busy ever since he got here.

402
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,150
I'm off!

403
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,160
He's working on a "painting," eh?

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,540
What could he mean by that?

405
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,480
Mr Chairman.

406
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,640
Director Do is here to see you.

407
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,160
Oh, Director Do. Welcome.

408
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,310
Did you call for me, Chairman?

409
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,280
Sorry for telling you to
come and go all the time.

410
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,490
-I know you're busy.
-No, sir.

411
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,542
It's Saturday afternoon,
so I actually have a bit of free time.

412
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,805
I know you're busy,

413
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,530
so I'll cut to the chase and
tell you why I called you here.

414
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,870
Get all of that equipment to
Doldam Hospital.

415
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,110
This is all equipment that

416
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,810
a small hospital like that
would have no use for.

417
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,810
Why do you want me to
get all this to Doldam?

418
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,750
The doctor said he needs all that.

419
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,295
So do it, will you?

420
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,520
By "the doctor",

421
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,492
do you mean Bu Yong-ju?

422
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,265
Yeah. Why?

423
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,230
Chairman.

424
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,789
Bu Yong-ju is someone

425
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,668
who was blacklisted
from the medical profession long ago.

426
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,883
If you examine this matter
both rationally and ethically

427
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,240
it'll be clear that
he's a dangerous person, so why...

428
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,710
Just shut your mouth and
do as I say, already!

429
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,890
It's not like any of your own money
is being used for this.

430
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,736
So why do you keep going on and on?

431
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,971
-It's annoying!
-But sir...

432
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,060
Do you want me to go and
buy this stuff myself instead?

433
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,868
Should I do that?

434
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,890
No, sir.

435
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,960
I'll do as you say.

436
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,400
All the finest spirits they have to
offer here are yours now, sir!

437
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,900
Please, drink as much as you'd like!

438
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,340
I didn't realize there was such
an open-minded person at Doldam.

439
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,163
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

440
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,840
By the way,

441
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,380
what business do you have
with our Dr Kang Dong-joo?

442
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,050
You don't need to know that.

443
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh, of course not!

444
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,290
I don't need to know.

445
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,856
All I can do is thank you
for sending us such a great doctor.

446
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,100
Here you are, sir.

447
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,670
Yes, Director?

448
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,540
What?

449
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,670
At Doldam Hospital?

450
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,752
Yes!

451
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,439
Get over there now!

452
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,820
What are you doing?

453
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,940
Oh, please, Mister!

454
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,174
Please, save my husband!

455
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,030
He'll die, at this rate!

456
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,400
Please, sir!

457
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,250
Please hurry over!

458
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,701
My husband will die!

459
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,110
Please!

460
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,978
Nurse Uhm.

461
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,217
Can you call Dr Kang Dong-joo
one more time?

462
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,160
How long will it take
for him to get here?

463
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,281
I actually just called him,
but he's not picking up.

464
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,350
What do you mean, he's not picking up?

465
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,220
I called him twice, but he won't pick up.

466
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,095
Oh no!

467
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,500
What do we do?

468
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,080
Let's readjust his pelvis first.

469
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,740
Give me a sheet, and hold this! Hurry!

470
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,320
What's going on?

471
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,980
I was able to reach his guardian.
Shall I move the patient to the OR?

472
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,310
Don't you have another general surgeon
here besides Kang Dong-joo?

473
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,060
We have one more,
but we can't reach him, either.

474
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,132
Can't you get an intervention, then?

475
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,910
We don't have that here, either.

476
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,730
Then you should send him
over to another hospital!

477
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,746
The closest general hospital
is two hours away.

478
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,210
The patient won't be able to handle that.

479
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,124
He'll go into cardiac arrest.

480
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,570
Dr Yoon.

481
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,105
His BP is 80/50.

482
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,584
Raise his nitro norepinephrine to 20,
and I'll give him antibiotics.

483
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,542
Do you have a laparoscope?

484
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,516
We have a used one that we acquired
from a hospital that closed down.

485
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,174
But... why?

486
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,076
It's fine. I'll do it.

487
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,139
I'll operate on that patient.

488
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,347
I'm sorry, but doctors who aren't
registered with us can't do that.

489
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,425
Can't we just let him do it?

490
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,895
We can't allow it, Dr Yoon.

491
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,280
Do you have another way
of saving that patient, then?

492
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,155
If he doesn't have his surgery done now,
he could die!

493
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,481
Do you have another way
of saving that patient, then?

494
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,040
Who's that person?

495
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,040
He's Dr Do In-bum,

496
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,227
a general surgeon from the main hospital.

497
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,633
I didn't hear about us
having a visiting doctor.

498
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,012
The patient has a gallbladder empyema
and even had a septic cardiac arrest.

499
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,680
Neither Teacher Kim nor
Kang Dong-joo will pick up.

500
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,390
If we send the
patient to another hospital,

501
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,810
he might die en route.

502
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,090
But this...

503
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,485
Please, Doctor.

504
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,132
Let's save the patient first and
deal with everything else later.

505
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,360
I'll use the laparoscope.

506
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,719
I'll only open him up fully if necessary.

507
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,889
Understood.

508
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, just a moment.

509
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,820
Dr Yoon!

510
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,027
It's a call for you
from Dr Kang Dong-joo.

511
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,429
Put it on speakerphone.

512
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,891
Dr Yoon, it's me, Kang Dong-joo.

513
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,635
I was on my way, but I got deterred
because there was an accident.

514
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,792
I heard that the patient
is in the OR now.

515
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,140
Just hold off for a bit.

516
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,970
I'll get there as soon as possible.

517
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,841
Dr Yoon? Dr Yoon!

518
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,009
Dr Yoon, are you listening to me?

519
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,880
Dr Yoon.

520
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,391
You're too late, Dr Kang.

521
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,590
The patient is already under anesthesia.

522
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,922
We can't stall for any more time.

523
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,410
Let's get started.

524
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,915
I'll start the surgery now.

525
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,566
Do In-bum?

526
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,021
I'll handle the scope.

527
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,146
Scalpel.

528
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,647
Scope.

529
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,581
Oh, his gallbladder is
completely corroded.

530
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
How did he bear this pain for this long?

531
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,681
I guess he had to,
in order to make a living.

532
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,620
But that's not nearly as important.

533
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,560
I'll only make two more punctures
since I only have one assistant.

534
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,924
It's an empyema. Will you be okay?

535
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:34,360
I'll have to try, at least.

536
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,826
Trocar.

537
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,250
Oh, Honey.

538
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,410
Open your eyes, please.

539
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,142
Oh, Honey, open your eyes.

540
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,430
Clasper.

541
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,730
Dissector.

542
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,533
As long as the dissection goes well,

543
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,640
it'll be over soon...

544
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,234
How are his vitals?

545
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,080
Stable, for the most part.

546
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,550
A tiller fell on him,

547
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,620
and he was under it for about 30 minutes.

548
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,650
He's bleeding a lot,

549
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,220
so please get two packs of RBC for him.

550
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,620
Also, defrost and prepare
four FFP packets.

551
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,060
His pelvis is dislocated,
so don't take the sheet off.

552
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,550
Leave it on and take a CT scan of him.

553
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,700
-I'll leave it to you, Nurse Uhm!
-Yes, sir.

554
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,531
Hold this, please. Let's move him here.

555
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,790
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

556
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,269
Doctor.

557
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,553
What are you doing here?

558
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,105
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,030
I thought you were here,
so I stepped out for a bit.

560
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,991
Wait, then who's performing
the surgery now?

561
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,442
Who is it, if it's not you?

562
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,210
The dissection is over.

563
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,990
All we need to do is
seal the cystic duct and artery.

564
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,745
Hemoclip.

565
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,969
How far has the operation progressed?

566
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,094
The patient had a gallbladder empyema
and even had a septic cardiac arrest.

567
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,190
We just discharged the gallbladder

568
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
and we're sealing up
the cystic duct and artery now.

569
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,300
Hey.

570
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,600
Hey! Who are you?

571
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,755
Do In-bum, a GS from the main hospital.

572
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,180
They weren't able to get in touch
with either one of Doldam's surgeons

573
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,540
so I had no choice but to step up.

574
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,333
I definitely called you.

575
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,816
Twice.

576
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,290
-Take out the laparoscope.
-Yes, I'll do it now.

577
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,904
Scope.

578
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,461
There's no bleeding,
and the duct was sealed well.

579
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,493
Dr Nam. Vitals?

580
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,750
BP is 100/75.

581
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,940
They're stabilizing.

582
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,880
We'll use the hemovac now,
and then stitch him up.

583
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,310
I'll finish up the surgery.

584
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,476
Please give me the hemovac.

585
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,416
And prepare the tools for suturing, too.

586
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,529
Mr Director!

587
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,500
You're here, sir?

588
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,970
What brings you all the way out here?

589
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,140
Were you drinking
in the middle of the day?

590
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,410
Hello, Director Yoon.

591
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,350
I'm Jang Ki-tae,
the Chief of Administration at Doldam.

592
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,610
Allow me to formally greet you.

593
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,720
I already told Director Yeo
that you'd be coming.

594
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,390
Let us go. It's this way.

595
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,811
Where is Bu Yong-ju right now?

596
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,047
I need to see him first.

597
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,975
What happened with the tractor patient?

598
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,380
According to the CT,
his pelvic bone is broken

599
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,700
and he has an open fracture on his femur.

600
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,226
We're in the process of finding
an orthopedic surgeon who can operate.

601
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,050
You follow up with that patient.

602
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,205
And you two. Follow me.

603
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,403
Dr Yoon...

604
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,814
Oh, so this is where you were,
Teacher Kim.

605
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,777
What is it, Chief Jang?

606
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,552
Well, the thing is, Teacher Kim...

607
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:48,606
It's been a while, huh?

608
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,658
How long has it been, now?

609
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,816
About 14 years or so?

610
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,420
I don't think such pleasantries are
appropriate considering our relationship.

611
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,360
Let's go somewhere quiet
and talk for a bit.

612
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,429
Mr Director.

613
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,674
Father.

614
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,574
Geez, what's this, now?

615
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,333
Your son sure picked
an interesting way to make an entrance.

616
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,145
What do you mean?

617
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,853
You see, Dr Do In-bum just
performed an operation in my OR.

618
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,401
He's a doctor who's not
even registered with our hospital.

619
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,504
He did it of his own volition,
without permission.

620
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,798
Did you really?

621
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,584
I asked you if you did!

622
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,251
I'm sorry.

623
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,156
I asked him to do it because
we had an emergency patient.

624
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,360
It's fine. I'll do it.

625
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,740
I know that we can't break the rules

626
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,323
but we had no choice
because of the patient.

627
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,130
Do you have another way
of saving that patient, then?

628
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,080
I overstepped my boundaries and
made this request of him.

629
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,270
I'm sorry.

630
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Hey, stop yapping and follow me.

631
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,202
Yoon Seo-jung. Did you really do this?

632
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,952
Did you really beg him to
perform the operation?

633
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,345
Yes, I...

634
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,534
No, I said that I'd do it.

635
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,710
She told me that there are
only two surgeons here.

636
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,504
And neither of them could be reached.

637
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,506
The closest hospital is two hours away
so we were at a loss.

638
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,716
That's why I said that I'd do it.

639
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,256
Who's telling the truth, here?

640
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,619
I'm telling the truth.

641
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,579
I asked him to do it.

642
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,916
Why are you taking responsibility
for something you didn't even do?

643
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,430
You're making me feel bad.

644
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm the one who said that I'd do it.

645
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,952
No, I'm the one who asked him to do it.

646
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,134
And Dr Do In-bum only helped me
because our hands were tied.

647
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,333
I don't feel grateful at all for you
sticking up for me like this.

648
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,130
Stop acting like a goody two shoes!

649
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,376
I'll take any and all responsibility.

650
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,445
Are you serious right now?

651
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,697
How long did it take?

652
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,113
I'm talking about the
laparoscopic procedure.

653
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,928
Not that long.

654
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,420
About 50 minutes, minus the time it took
for the patient to be anesthetized.

655
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,167
If you had better equipment,
it would've saved me five minutes.

656
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,607
Okay.

657
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,930
I'll talk to the main hospital about this
and tell you our decision later.

658
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,065
So get out, both of you.

659
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,519
May I ask what you're planning to do?

660
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,303
Performing a surgery at a hospital

661
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,343
you're not registered at
is against the rules.

662
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,213
So it'll be a punishment
befitting that action.

663
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,648
His gallbladder was
about to rupture, Doctor.

664
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,713
He even went into cardiac arrest, Doctor.

665
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,540
And just because of that,

666
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,730
you entrusted a patient
to an external doctor?

667
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,900
Even though you're just a helper?

668
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,828
How dare someone like you
make a decision like that?

669
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm sorry, sir.

670
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,120
For making that decision
when I'm just a helper.

671
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,342
And I'm sorry again...

672
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,580
for saying that I'd take responsibility
for everything, despite my position.

673
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,899
I'm really, truly sorry for that...
but...

674
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,681
putting that aside, if I were to go back
to that moment one more time...

675
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,500
I would've made the same decision.

676
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,150
Are you implying that
what you did was okay?

677
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,070
I mean that I would've done everything
I could have, for the patient's sake.

678
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Whether you acknowledge me or not.

679
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,731
Whether I may be skilled or not.

680
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,980
Because despite everything...

681
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,150
I'm a doctor.

682
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,530
It's me, Teacher Kim.

683
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,080
I'll be stepping in for a moment.

684
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,186
Um, Teacher Kim.

685
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,900
Director Do Yoon-wan is
waiting for you upstairs.

686
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,890
What should I do?

687
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,262
Excuse me, Teacher Kim...

688
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,894
Director Yeo has prepared
some special tea for you.

689
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,504
Oh my goodness.

690
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,180
I must be crazy.

691
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,520
What do I do?

692
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,380
What do I do?

693
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,820
What do I do?

694
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,659
Oh my goodness!

695
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,192
Darn it, you crazy girl!

696
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,674
Woo Yeon-hwa. August 6, 1991.
Nationality: Chinese

697
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,540
My Chinese character skills
are a bit lacking.

698
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,700
Are you Chinese, by any chance?

699
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,940
I see.

700
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,329
How good is your Korean?

701
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,380
I just... speak a little bit.

702
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,785
I know the basics, at the very least.

703
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,498
That's a relief.

704
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,860
I was scared for a second because
I thought you couldn't speak Korean.

705
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,410
By the way...

706
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,100
I have a favor to ask you.

707
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,770
What?

708
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,670
She doesn't have money for her bill?

709
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,040
No, she doesn't.

710
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,520
So, she wants us to give her a freebie?

711
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,854
Um, that's not it.

712
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,710
She said that she'll do all the odd jobs
around here to pay us back.

713
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,060
So she does want a freebie.

714
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,450
She said that she was robbed of
all of her belongings.

715
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,290
And even when I told her
I'd cover her bill, she refused.

716
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,770
And it's not because
you're interested in her, right?

717
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,694
No...

718
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,840
I just feel bad for her, is all.

719
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,740
You know, "We are the world."

720
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,940
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

721
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,220
It's tangerine peel tea.

722
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,250
The scent is quite nice.

723
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,320
You were right
under my nose this whole time.

724
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,890
To think that you even changed your name

725
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,850
and were working here.

726
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,585
I really got backstabbed
quite nicely, didn't I?

727
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,830
No, stabbing others in the back
is your specialty.

728
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,370
I'm sure you've earned more than
enough money after all you've done.

729
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,870
But it looks like the only thing
you care about is money, just as ever.

730
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,180
What?

731
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
An assisted living facility?

732
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,002
AERIAL VIEW: GEOSAN UNIVERSITY
HOSPITAL ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY

733
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,560
The air is nice out here,
and it really is the perfect spot.

734
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,850
So there's no reason
why we shouldn't build it here.

735
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,150
All of your patient rooms are empty.

736
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,070
So we'll have to make
use of that empty space.

737
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,540
Do you know how many
national highways pass through here?

738
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,690
Why should I have to know that?

739
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,784
Five in total, including the ones nearby.

740
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,810
And on top of that there are

741
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,440
about 8,500 people in and
out of here per day due to the casino.

742
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,040
Including the traffic accident patients
we get here

743
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,810
we get about 30 to 40 patients.

744
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,420
And during the peak season,
we surpass 50 to 60 patients.

745
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,350
But!

746
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,620
If you build an assisted
living facility here like this

747
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,350
where are all of those patients
supposed to go?

748
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,090
That's none of my business.

749
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,890
How could you say that,
as a director of a hospital?

750
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:29,230
I hate having unproductive discussions
with those beneath me, you see.

751
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,870
Are you sure?

752
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,710
Are you aware that it's illegal
for a doctor to perform surgery

753
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,290
at a hospital where
they're not registered, though?

754
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,450
They said it couldn't be helped because
it was an emergency patient.

755
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,930
I mean, what's the big deal?

756
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,330
Our hospitals are affiliated.

757
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,490
Sure, sure.

758
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,100
Who cares about that
when a patient could've died, right?

759
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,240
But I can very easily
make this into a problem, too.

760
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,670
If you touch my son,

761
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,810
it'll be the end for you, too.

762
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,980
Geez, I'm quaking in my boots!

763
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,050
But you know,
my career ended 14 years ago,

764
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,880
so I'm not too scared.

765
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,090
But your son is
just barely getting started.

766
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,090
You jerk...

767
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,190
You've become a real thug, haven't you?

768
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,290
It's all thanks to you,
so stop playing dumb.

769
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,690
What is it that you want?

770
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:41,300
Our hospital needs a couple of things
since it's a bit old.

771
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:47,310
I think we'll be okay with equipment
since Chairman Shin is taking care of it.

772
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,920
But he only has money.

773
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,150
He knows nothing about doctors.

774
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,290
So what is it that you want?

775
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,220
Your son.

776
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,790
Send him down here.

777
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,400
Are you...trying to threaten me
with my own son, right now?

778
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,440
I think I'll be able to
make really good use of him.

779
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,540
I'll raise him to be useful.

780
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,850
So just send him here.

781
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,250
You're totally
out of your mind, aren't you?

782
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,080
Hey, come now.

783
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,290
I haven't even gotten started yet.

784
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,680
Director...

785
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,350
What's your dream, Seo-jung?

786
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,720
What do you want to be when you grow up?

787
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,690
What are your dreams for your future?

788
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,020
He was the first adult

789
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,460
who asked me what I wanted to be
when I grew up.

790
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,530
A doctor!

791
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,700
I want to become a great doctor like you.

792
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,440
No... to be honest,

793
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,950
my dream wasn't to be a good doctor.

794
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,810
It was to be someone that
the director would acknowledge.

795
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,240
I see.

796
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,710
But I...

797
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,290
I'm sorry, sir.

798
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,360
It wasn't my intention to
make things this way.

799
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,730
I really am sorry.

800
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,200
You truly...

801
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,000
have disappointed me.

802
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,490
You fool.

803
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,750
Do you think you'll really be okay
after ruffling his feathers like that?

804
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,220
Geez... the scent of this tea
sure is nice.

805
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,160
You said this was
tangerine peel tea, right?

806
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,760
Thank you for the tea.

807
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,470
Excuse me. I told you,
it's an emergency patient.

808
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,410
He has an open book pelvic bone fracture,

809
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,370
so he needs surgery now.

810
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,340
I'm telling you, we don't have
an orthopedic surgeon here!

811
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,595
Do you really not have
a single bed left in your ICU?

812
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,280
Or are you lying to me?

813
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,220
Are you saying that you don't care
if the patient lives or dies, then?

814
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,520
Whatever.

815
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,958
Whatever!

816
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,160
Any luck?

817
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,530
They say that they can't do
surgeries right now and refused.

818
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,160
What's the last hospital on the list?

819
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,480
Oh yes, hello.

820
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,347
It's Teacher Kim from Doldam Hospital.

821
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,333
How are you?

822
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,420
Yes, we have a patient
with an open book pelvic bone fracture.

823
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,220
Yes. We need an emergency surgery
done by an orthopedic surgeon.

824
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,030
Oh, yes.

825
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,760
Yes, thank you.

826
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:58,960
We'll see you soon, then.

827
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,530
Make preparations to move the patient
by the chopper right away.

828
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,260
We'll leave him to you, then!

829
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,660
Yes, thank you for your hard work!

830
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,880
Please be careful!

831
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,640
What'll happen to Seo-jung now?

832
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,010
Please, tell me.
What's going to happen to Seo-jung?

833
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,120
It's just as you said.

834
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,990
We're the only two surgeons
at this miserable hospital.

835
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,320
But neither of us were present.

836
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,630
What more could I want from her

837
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,036
when she did so well
in a situation like that?

838
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,610
Hey, make sure you confirm
whether or not I'm here before leaving.

839
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,530
Got that?

840
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,010
And... I'll do that from now on, too.

841
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,680
It sure was simple when it was just me.

842
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,150
I was an idiot for being excited
about getting another surgeon.

843
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,120
Be careful.

844
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,220
He's pretty much a psychopath.

845
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,960
If you aren't careful,

846
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,620
you could flush
your whole career down the toilet!

847
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,995
Can I help you?

848
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,902
I'm here to see Mr Choi Gyu-sik.

849
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,240
Oh, please put on a mask and
disinfect your hands before going in.

850
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,310
It's me, Honey.

851
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,908
Are you okay?

852
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,250
Oh, geez!

853
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,200
Oh, you!

854
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,920
I told you to go to the hospital
instead of just bearing it!

855
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:16,430
Money doesn't matter
if we don't have you, honey.

856
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,900
You know that, right?

857
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,122
So please, regain your strength.

858
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,104
I love you.

859
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,640
You know that, right?

860
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,490
It's fine.

861
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,460
You did a good thing.

862
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,530
Good job, Yoon Seo-jung.

863
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,000
You did the right thing.

864
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,880
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Nurse Park.

865
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,650
Excuse me.

866
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,520
Yes?

867
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,590
Have this to eat
when you're feeling peckish.

868
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,150
Oh.

869
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,790
See you tomorrow.

870
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,820
Did Patient Jung Woong-jin's
CT scan results come out?

871
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,740
Yes.

872
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,290
Oh, Darn it!

873
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,090
How can you manage to drink
when you did this to me?

874
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,670
I begged you to turn off the stove

875
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,840
so the broth wouldn't burn down

876
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,160
and yet, you let the pot
burn down like this?

877
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:59,300
This was a stock that
I worked so hard on, too...

878
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,600
Your chicken's here!

879
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,440
You pay for that, Teacher Kim.

880
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,180
Yes, thank you.

881
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,410
What's with the fried chicken?

882
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,660
Didn't you say you were
making chicken noodles?

883
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,150
Ask Teacher Kim.

884
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,800
How's Dr Yoon doing?

885
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,560
Well, you know. So-so...

886
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,270
Why? Did something happen?

887
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,330
She looked me

888
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:35,470
in the eye for the first time
and talked back to me.

889
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,950
She didn't falter even once,
and clearly said what she had to say.

890
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,410
Really? Yoon Seo-jung did that?

891
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,180
Geez... she sure has grown a lot.

892
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,710
I told you that she's a clever woman.

893
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,830
Just wait and see.
She'll surprise you a lot later on, too.

894
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,650
I am not sure.

895
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,750
I told you. Just wait and see.

896
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,090
Wait, wait, wait!

897
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,600
Let me get in on this too!

898
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,690
Come on!

899
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,510
Bu Yong-ju.

900
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,010
You jerk...

901
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,650
Teacher Kim!

902
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,400
Where is Teacher Kim?

903
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,170
What is it now?

904
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,500
It's an emergency!

905
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,930
Where is Teacher Kim?

906
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,173
Teacher Kim!

907
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,680
Huh? What?

908
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,940
This is no time to be sleeping,
Teacher Kim!

909
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,100
Something has happened!

910
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,037
It's huge! Huge, I tell you!

911
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,310
What are the patient's vitals?

912
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,400
What's all this, now?

913
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,890
They're from the main hospital.

914
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:16,960
The main hospital?

915
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,630
Hello, everyone at Doldam Hospital.

916
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,040
I'm Chief Song Hyun-chul
of the surgical department,

917
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,705
who has been assigned here.

918
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,512
I'm looking forward to working with you.
