DEATH CERTIFICATE

3
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,497
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

4
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,233
NAME: KANG DONG-JOO

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,504
What... is this?

6
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,508
All you have to do is
sign that and save it as it is.

7
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,312
This patient hasn't died yet.

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,014
He's still alive.

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,949
Then, why should I...

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,617
His BP keeps dropping.

11
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,119
He's not passing any urine, either.

12
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,388
If he's showing no stem signs
after going into cardiac arrest,

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,989
he's pretty much brain-dead.

14
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,090
Some patients who have...

15
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,259
...a return of spontaneous circulation
don't show stem signs.

16
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,261
We can't make those kinds of judgments...

17
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,488
...until we've monitored him
for at least a day or two.

18
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,877
And on top of that,
"Cause of Death: Death from disease?"

19
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,703
Here are military hospital records
regarding Private Park.

20
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,039
It seemed that...

21
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,625
...he'd been receiving treatment
for diverticulitis for a while.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,709
Here, for your reference.

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,677
It wasn't diverticulitis!

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,079
He had a bowel perforation
due to blunt force trauma!

25
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,114
I opened him up and saw that for myself!

26
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,382
He's a deserter!

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,486
And on top of that,
he was treated due to physical injuries.

28
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,990
Think about how sensitive
this issue could become.

29
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,494
Imagine what would happen
if the press found out about this.

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:39,132
The internet and such will be
buzzing about this news.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,102
And all of this will end with
some midlevel manager...

32
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,538
...who did nothing wrong
being forced to quit.

33
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,374
We can't be so irresponsible
as to let that happen.

34
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:51,778
So...

35
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,485
...are you telling me to lie?

36
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,725
I'm telling you to
make the rational choice.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,293
Exactly!

38
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,796
So you're telling me to write
a death certificate that is full of lies.

39
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,769
And for a living person, at that...

40
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,639
...and sign it?

41
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,476
Sometimes, in life...

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,913
...being silent is
more important than the truth.

43
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,715
Just think of this as
one of those moments.

44
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,825
I'm sorry, but I'll pretend that
this meeting never happened.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,065
Kang Dong-joo!

46
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,477
Letting yourself get held back
by your own sense of justice...

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,580
...is what you do when you're immature.

48
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,217
But you're an adult now.

49
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,321
As a doctor, and as a
contributing member of society,

50
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,490
you need to take on more responsibility.

51
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,125
Okay?

52
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:18,165
Let's settle this quietly and simply,
Kang Dong-joo.

53
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,381
What is the meaning of this?

54
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,184
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,494
All of you are gathered here like this.

56
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,265
Just what are you plotting
this time around?

57
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,332
Huh?

58
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,809
Director?

59
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,604
EPISODE 12

60
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,039
Yong-gyun.

61
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,108
What about our Joo-hyuk?

62
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,143
Huh?

63
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,611
How's Joo-hyuk?

64
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,247
Oh, my child!

65
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
Joo-hyuk!

66
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,673
Joo-hyuk!

67
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,081
Joo-hyuk!

68
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,855
Joo-hyuk.

69
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,726
Oh... oh my!

70
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,129
Oh my.

71
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,126
He's going into cardiac arrest, Doctor!

72
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,803
Nurse Oh! Call Dr Kang Dong-joo!

73
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,699
We ask that the guardians leave
for just a bit, please.

74
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:41,951
Just a moment, ma'am.

75
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,143
-Just a moment.
-Ma'am?

76
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,178
Just a moment.

77
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,420
Oh... oh no.

78
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,123
Oh... Doctor!

79
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,858
ER

80
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,410
Yes, Nurse Oh. I'm on my way now.

81
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:13,802
-What happened?
-He's gone into cardiac arrest again!

82
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,754
Hurry and get the defibrillator.

83
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,588
DEATH CERTIFICATE NAME: PARK JOO-HYUK

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,491
200 joules.

85
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,946
Back away.

86
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,273
Clear!

87
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,868
I'll do more compressions.

88
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:42,122
Here, I'll do them.

89
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:51,837
Checking his heart rate now.

90
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:56,850
One more time.

91
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,985
200 joules!

92
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,786
Ready, Doctor.

93
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,156
Clear!

94
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,778
You have to live.

95
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:15,976
You're still so young!

96
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,970
You have to live!

97
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,880
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

98
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,109
You have to live.

99
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:34,264
Darn it.

100
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,626
Dr Kang...

101
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,079
Time of death...

102
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,855
20:48.

103
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,442

EPISODE 12
Boiling Point

105
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,163
-This one?
-The one in the back.

106
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,255
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:58,797 --> 00:08:59,865
Excuse me.

108
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,177
How do I get to Doldam Hospital?

109
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:19,026
What happened was quite unfortunate.

110
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:24,331
The military will cooperate with you
fully regarding the funeral procession.

111
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,099
Thank you.

112
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,436
I'm sorry enough that
he became a deserter.

113
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,806
And yet, you're going above
and beyond for us.

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,342
If you ever need assistance,

115
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,110
please contact me anytime.

116
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,613
Goodbye, then.

117
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,285
Joo-hyuk was murdered!

118
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:58,265
What... do you mean by that, Yong-gyun?

119
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,568
Three of his superiors would
subject him to physical punishments...

120
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,870
...and hit him all the time for no reason.

121
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,938
That's why he didn't return to the base.

122
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,807
That's why he died!

123
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,075
Look here, young man!

124
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,987
You can't say things like that
when nothing has been confirmed.

125
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,508
I'm sure that you'd upset
Mr Park's parents...

126
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,293
...even more by doing so.

127
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,862
The doctor in charge of
his surgery said that, too.

128
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,165
He said that it was due to getting hit
that Joo-hyuk ended up like that!

129
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,002
And I heard him talking to you, myself!

130
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,308
I definitely heard him say that, Mister.

131
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,411
If you go and ask
the doctor in charge of him...

132
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,672
...I'm sure he'll answer us truthfully.

133
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,647
And where can I...

134
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,619
...go to meet this doctor?

135
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,323
I'll escort you there.

136
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,494
Please follow me.

137
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,129
DEATH CERTIFICATE

138
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,431
Just do it this once.

139
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,100
I'll be real for a second.

140
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,703
You think I'm living like this
because I love Director Do?

141
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,573
It's so I don't fall
out of his good graces.

142
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,875
It's so I can stick by him and
live a nice life...

143
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,678
...instead of a shoddy one.

144
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,515
At your age, that doesn't seem
that important, right?

145
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,622
Just wait until you
get to my age, though.

146
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,086
When you whiz past your 40s and
your 50s are just around the corner...

147
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,322
...the situation itself changes entirely!

148
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,524
Who you side with can...

149
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,793
...change your entire world!

150
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,100
All you have to do is be
obedient to Director Do.

151
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,669
If you just do that,

152
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,472
your entire life will change forever!

153
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,407
Got it?

154
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,549
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

155
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,099
Patient Park Joo-hyuk's
parents would like to...

156
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,625
...ask you a couple of things.

157
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,523
Do you have time?

158
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,894
Please come in.

159
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,003
Hello.

160
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,873
I'm Joo-hyuk's father.

161
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,476
I heard that you said

162
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,080
Joo-hyuk may have been beaten up.

163
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,816
Is this true?

164
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,261
Please, Doctor.

165
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,037
He was healthy two months ago,
when he was on leave.

166
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,006
So how did he end up like that?

167
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,543
We need to know the reason why.

168
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:05,552
Please tell us what you know, Doctor.

169
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,622
Please.

170
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,294
Doctor.

171
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,833
What are you doing, Dr Kang Dong-joo?

172
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,369
Hurry up and say something.

173
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,377
I...

174
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,348
...need to look into
this matter a bit further.

175
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,087
And I have to confirm the records...

176
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,156
...saying that your son was
treated at a military hospital.

177
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,094
It will take some more time for me to...

178
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,430
...finish writing the death certificate.

179
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,269
Excuse me.

180
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:35,735
Are you going somewhere?

181
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,946
I'm just getting some fresh air.

182
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,781
Why did you do that?

183
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,249
What are you talking about?

184
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,718
There were bruises on
Mr Park Joo-hyuk's body.

185
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,322
And you confirmed that he had
a bowel perforation due to trauma.

186
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,389
You should've told them all that.

187
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,696
So why didn't you say anything?

188
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:53,994
Are you even listening to me?

189
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:55,696
Hello?

190
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,199
I asked if you were listening to me,

191
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,567
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

192
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,737
I'm just tired, that is all.

193
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:04,705
Let's talk later.

194
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,482
What's with him?

195
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,304
Welcome!

196
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,773
Kang Dong-joo!

197
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,517
I'm sorry if I interrupted you two.

198
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,286
Oh no, not at all!

199
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,887
Hey, hey! Not at all!

200
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,088
You didn't interrupt anything,
so come in.

201
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,323
Come in!

202
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:57,797
Well?

203
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,227
Are you here for a drink,
or to have dinner?

204
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,574
Please give me a bottle of soju.

205
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,197
Sure.

206
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,745
MOTHER

207
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:24,651
Taxi!

208
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:41,474
Drink up.

209
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,370
I'm buying.

210
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,172
Go ahead and drink.

211
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,952
Drink up.

212
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,924
You don't have to drink
if you don't think you can handle it.

213
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,362
No, I can drink.

214
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,903
Would you like another?

215
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,005
Yes.

216
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,749
A drinking contest?

217
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,217
Between Teacher Kim and Dr Kang?

218
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,518
A drinking contest?

219
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,720
That's what he's telling me.

220
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,289
How much have they had to drink?

221
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,724
They just opened
their eighth bottle of soju.

222
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,193
Eight bottles?

223
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,105
Since when have you known?

224
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,507
Huh?

225
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,242
That it was me.

226
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,114
That I was the one who wreaked havoc
in that ER back then.

227
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,685
Since when have you known?

228
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,553
Let me ask you something, too.

229
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,189
Why did you become a doctor?

230
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,594
Well, you said to me...

231
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,864
that if I wanted to get revenge,

232
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,699
I should do it with my skill.

233
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,668
And I did just that.

234
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,439
So I could show people
that I wasn't a pushover.

235
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,277
Because I wanted to make it impossible...

236
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,914
...for those who looked down on me
to look down on me any longer.

237
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,785
Because I wanted to show them that...

238
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,494
...I'm a different human being than them.

239
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,824
But, you know...

240
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,928
...judging from the decisions you make,

241
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,597
you're not much different than them.

242
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,599
Because nothing else works.

243
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,502
Because I have to get to the top,
no matter what it takes.

244
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,604
That's the only way...

245
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,107
I'll be able to face off
against Director Do, or whomever.

246
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,343
So...

247
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,380
...if you accept his offer of a 15
percent raise in your annual salary...

248
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:10,884
...as well as 100,000 dollars for
your research every year you think...

249
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,787
...that'll help you rise in the ranks?

250
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,623
You'll have to become
obedient to Director Do...

251
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,026
...and pledge your loyalty to him.

252
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,729
Yeah?
And then, you'll be promoted to Chief...

253
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,866
...and your name will be in
all of the scientific journals!

254
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:31,471
Will you finally have achieved
the success you so desired then?

255
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,507
Isn't that how the world works?

256
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:39,479
That's what this world
qualifies as "success."

257
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,850
Because if I don't take someone's side,

258
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,619
I'll become less than nothing.

259
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:50,891
So you throw away your self-esteem
and your conscience for that?

260
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,460
And cast your sense of shame...

261
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:54,962
...into the wind?

262
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,064
Can I protect my pride...

263
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,934
...if I live as less than nothing?

264
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,439
Can I protect my conscience when...

265
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,510
...I'm completely powerless?

266
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,788
Do you know how hellish and painful
it is to be walked all over...

267
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:26,727
...just because you have
no money or influence?

268
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,598
Well, greed makes it...

269
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:36,436
...quite easy for people
to spout any sort of excuse.

270
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,139
"My hands were tied."

271
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,109
"I had to do this!"

272
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,247
Hey, Kang Dong-joo.

273
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:53,887
In my opinion,
it's not your conscience that is hurting.

274
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,689
It's your greed that is hurting.

275
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,862
Did you go into my mind and
take a good look around?

276
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,030
Huh?

277
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,665
I'm well acquainted
with the dilemma that arises...

278
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,801
...when a self-destructive
guy like you is...

279
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,355
...torn between his
reality and his ideals.

280
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:18,712
But doctors, especially surgeons
who operate on people...

281
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,382
...need to take on the responsibility...

282
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,952
...that comes with the patient's life.

283
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,956
Remember that.

284
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,836
This is the video footage
of Mr Kim's surgery.

285
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,571
Do with it as you see fit.

286
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,108
You can grill it, or boil it,
or do whatever you want.

287
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,043
Whatever you decide to do,

288
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,313
shoulder that burden.

289
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,457
Do-il! Charge me for the liquor.

290
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:04,525
Oh, okay.

291
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,617
Um, excuse me.

292
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,686
We're done offering
consultations for the day.

293
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,022
I'm not here for that.

294
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,757
Are you checking out for the ER?

295
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,492
In that case,
please head to the register Number 3.

296
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,760
About Kang Dong-joo...

297
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,832
Oh, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

298
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,100
Where are you headed?

299
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,636
To Kang Dong-joo...

300
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,406
He's totally drunk and passed out.

301
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,875
Geez, what a nuisance!

302
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:57,411
He should drink nicely
and not be a nuisance.

303
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,179
Listen, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

304
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:02,616
Or he could've just had a couple of cans
in the staff room and slept.

305
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:03,550
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

306
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:06,653
I'm old, and it's late,
and it's so cold outside!

307
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,088
Do I really need to
drop everything and pick up...

308
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,791
...my drunken colleague, at this age?

309
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,226
Isn't that right, In-bum?

310
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,772
Isn't that right, Section Chief Jang?

311
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,730
What's the matter?

312
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:19,900
This is Dr Kang Dong-joo's mother.

313
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,043
Hello, Mrs Kang. Nice to meet you.

314
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:36,416
This is our ER specialist,
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

315
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,452
Oh, I see.

316
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,686
It's nice to meet you.

317
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:53,634
So Dong-joo spends
his days here, it seems.

318
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:57,504
Yes, there is a dorm for employees
nearby but Kang Dong-joo...

319
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:04,645
...I mean, Dr Kang Dong-joo says
that he likes the staff room better.

320
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,781
I'm sure you're well aware of this,
but that punk...

321
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,149
Oh.

322
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,251
I mean, Dr Kang Dong-joo...

323
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:15,489
...is quite stubborn when
he puts his mind to something.

324
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,157
He is, isn't he?

325
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,825
It's because he takes after his dad.

326
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,129
But still...

327
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,130
He never would've been
able to finish his studies well...

328
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,799
...if it hadn't been for
that stubborn streak of his.

329
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, yes. Of course.

330
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,268
Yes.

331
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,706
Would you like me to
bring you a beverage?

332
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:41,215
I'm not that difficult of a person,
you know.

333
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:43,083
You don't need to be so nervous.

334
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,318
Okay?

335
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,020
Oh. Yes, ma'am.

336
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,525
How dare you?

337
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,026
-Hey, hey.
-Come on.

338
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:54,595
-Do In-bum!
-Ugh.

339
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,163
Two hours in Karaoke, it's on me!

340
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,264
What's with him?

341
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,166
Oh my...

342
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,135
Why did you drink so much alcohol?

343
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,470
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

344
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,705
Dr Kang Dong-joo!

345
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:05,672
Oh.

346
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,343
It's Dr Seo-Jung.

347
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:15,115
Oh, my pretty Yoon Seo-Jung!

348
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:18,243
Hey, what's with you?

349
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,769
Get off me. Get off.

350
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:22,553
Oh, don't be like that!

351
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,825
Why do you treat me like this?

352
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,093
Hey, your mother is here!

353
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,661
Get off, already!

354
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,041
Hey.

355
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:47,114
I really like you a lot, Dr Yoon.

356
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,684
Huh?

357
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,888
Hey. Get it together, already.

358
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:56,924
Get your hands off me, and go away!

359
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,294
Didn't you hear me?

360
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:06,233
I... like you a lot, Dr Yoon.

361
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:08,936
Darn it!

362
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,382
Get off me!

363
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,190
Dong-joo!

364
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,323
Oh no... Kang Dong-joo.

365
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,289
Are you... are you okay?

366
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm sorry.

367
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,026
I'm so sorry!

368
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,194
Hey!

369
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,796
Kang Dong-joo! Are you okay?

370
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,197
Hey! Kang Dong-joo!

371
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,674
It's hot.

372
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,993
What happened to Dr Kang?

373
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:08,981
What's the matter, Dr Yoon?

374
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,164
Did something happen?

375
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:16,336
I want to sink really deep
into the ground right now.

376
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,188
Dong-joo.

377
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,560
Dong-joo?

378
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,730
About that woman
you called "Dr Seo-Jung."

379
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:45,966
Do you like her?

380
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,102
I did.

381
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,005
I did.

382
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,976
Oh, I like her so much.

383
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,548
Oh my.

384
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,247
KANG DONG-JOO IS NOT A DOCTOR.
HE IS A MURDERER.

385
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,851
Kang Dong...

386
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,120
Geez, who put up such a thing?

387
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:43,857
Oh, geez.

388
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:45,926
What a tasteless prank!

389
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,294
Geez...

390
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,764
Huh? Oh?

391
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,074
Oh my goodness!

392
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,546
KANG DONG-JOO IS NOT A DOCTOR.
HE IS A MURDERER.

393
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:19,193
I went around the first and second floors
and took down all the ones I saw.

394
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,395
Oh my...

395
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,132
Oh, all of you are here.

396
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,435
Who...

397
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,505
Who in the world did
such a terrible thing?

398
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,025
I'm curious about the same thing.

399
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,685
The employees are trying to
find out who's responsible.

400
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,544
Has Dr Kang Dong-joo
reported to work yet?

401
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,614
What should we do?

402
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,550
Dr Kang's mother even
came here yesterday night.

403
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,933
KANG DONG-JOO IS NOT A DOCTOR.
HE IS A MURDERER.

404
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:10,777
Mom?

405
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,313
Oh... oh, Dong-joo.

406
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,182
You're up?

407
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,184
What brings you here?

408
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,253
I just came because I missed you.

409
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,721
When did you get here?

410
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,122
Oh, last night.

411
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:25,192
Why did you drink so much alcohol?

412
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,194
You should've drunk in moderation.

413
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,531
Do you want some water first?

414
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:34,401
Oh. It'd be nice if you had honey,
or something.

415
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:35,936
Is there any?

416
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:36,870
No.

417
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:37,871
Okay.

418
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,941
I should buy you some honey and...

419
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,411
...send it over as soon as
I get back to Seoul.

420
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:45,979
Here, drink.

421
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:48,882
Drink up!

422
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,417
Let me see, here.

423
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:52,920
Is there anything for you to eat?

424
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:54,821
Let me see, here.

425
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,816
KANG DONG-JOO IS NOT A DOCTOR.
HE IS A MURDERER.

426
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:28,789
Who are you?

427
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,891
What are you doing there?

428
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,727
Excuse me, what are you doing?

429
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,791
I just asked you what you're doing.
This is a hospital!

430
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,502
I'm protesting.

431
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,637
Stop it right now
before we call the police!

432
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:44,705
Go ahead and call them.

433
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,840
You doctors should
protect each other, after all.

434
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,308
Go ahead and do it.

435
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:50,511
What did you just say?

436
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,779
Even if I get dragged away,
I'll come back and do this again...

437
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,448
...and do this again, and again.

438
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:59,319
I'm going to keep putting these up
until that doctor stops working here...

439
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,386
...so let's just see who wins, shall we?

440
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:17,738
Who are you?

441
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,908
Who are you that you dare to...

442
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:24,044
...put these kinds of things up?

443
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,079
You already forgot?

444
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,516
You killed my father, Doctor.

445
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,821
Because of that Assemblyman Go Man-suk...

446
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,657
...who was the chairman
of the National Assembly...

447
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:38,592
...you pushed back my father's surgery.

448
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:40,961
You don't remember?

449
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,928
What do you mean,
you're pushing back the surgery?

450
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:52,940
Is there some sort of issue
with my father?

451
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:54,675
I'll choose a new surgery date...

452
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,177
...after monitoring him
for a few more days.

453
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:58,512
Doctor!

454
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,453
Mr Seo Myung-woo's guardian.

455
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:08,856
So you remember his name.

456
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,125
Did... he pass away?

457
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:15,195
Yes, he did.

458
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,332
After you pushed back his surgery,

459
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,467
a new doctor was put in charge of him...

460
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,979
...and his surgery kept getting
pushed back more and more.

461
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:26,273
And eventually, he died of acute sepsis.

462
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,846
Why did you push back his surgery?

463
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,315
My father's surgery was scheduled first.

464
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,654
Because that assemblyman was a VIP...

465
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:43,977
...and my father
had no money or influence?

466
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,895
But still, how could you...

467
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:51,315
You shouldn't be treating one life as if
it's more important than another!

468
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,979
Especially not as someone
who calls himself a doctor!

469
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:56,301
You people, of all people,
shouldn't be doing that!

470
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,338
You dare toy with people's lives?

471
00:33:58,572 --> 00:34:01,341
Doctors shouldn't be doing that!

472
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:03,277
My father was first in line!

473
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:06,747
My father was first in line!

474
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,373
My father came in first!

475
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:11,785
My father came in before that man did!

476
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,754
So you should've treated him first!

477
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,031
I'll never forgive you.

478
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,067
I can never forgive doctors like you!

479
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:31,772
I'll make it so that you can't
show your face anywhere again.

480
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:34,508
I'm going to risk
my own life to make sure...

481
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:37,244
...that you can never practice
as a doctor again.

482
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,565
KANG DONG-JOO IS NOT A DOCTOR.
HE IS A MURDERER.

483
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:15,148
Hey, Kang Dong-joo.

484
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,150
There's no need to worry
too much about this.

485
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:20,020
I'll call the police and
resolve this matter for you...

486
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:21,731
...so there's no need for you to worry.

487
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:22,789
No.

488
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:24,191
Don't resolve this for him.

489
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,794
Just watch over him for now.

490
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,096
But Teacher Kim!

491
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,809
If we just leave things as they are,
both Dr Kang Dong-joo's image...

492
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,835
...and Doldam Hospital's image can
become irreparably damaged!

493
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,015
I told you,
there's nothing to worry about!

494
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:41,008
People all forget sooner
or later with time.

495
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,646
For now, just buck up and bear it!

496
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:48,659
The hospital will take care of
cleaning up your image for you later.

497
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,149
This is something that
he has to handle on his own.

498
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:54,821
If he avoids it, or has someone else
solve this issue for him...

499
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:58,142
...this entire matter could pass by
without him learning anything from it.

500
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:59,993
But still, even his mother is here.

501
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,700
And don't worry about
your mother, either!

502
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:04,431
I'll speak to her and
resolve this for you.

503
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:08,368
She needs to be
aware of the true struggles...

504
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,704
...that come with being a doctor.

505
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:16,143
So, did you submit the death certificate?

506
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:22,282
Just get that taken care of first.

507
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,452
And I'll take care of
everything else for you!

508
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,254
Okay?

509
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:30,257
This man killed my father.

510
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:32,059
He's Dr Kang Dong-joo, and he works here.

511
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,361
This man killed my father.

512
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,068
He's Dr Kang Dong-joo, and he works here.

513
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:40,000
This man killed my father.

514
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,002
He's Dr Kang Dong-joo, and he works here.

515
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,705
DEATH CERTIFICATE NAME: PARK JOO-HYUK

516
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:49,676
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

517
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,488
Kang Dong-joo.

518
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,849
You still haven't submitted
the death certificate?

519
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,960
Park Joo-hyuk's parents
have been waiting for it all night...

520
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,987
...and haven't even gone home yet
because of that.

521
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,607
Hey. Dr Kang Dong-joo.

522
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,319
I have some things I need to think about.

523
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,410
Think? About what?

524
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:27,458
Why would you need to ruminate over
what to put on a death certificate?

525
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:28,949
You just have to state the facts.

526
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,885
But the facts aren't always right.

527
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,923
What kind of nonsense is that,
all of the sudden?

528
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,593
He was a deserter.

529
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:42,533
So imagine if it was revealed that
he died an unnatural death.

530
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,498
There would be uproar.

531
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:48,468
That could have
so many detrimental effects.

532
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,305
So I can't not think it over.

533
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,874
Like I said, why do you need to
think about this at all?

534
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,344
You're merely a doctor and the doctor
who was in charge of him.

535
00:37:57,744 --> 00:38:00,113
All doctors have to do
is deliver the facts.

536
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:06,787
Wait...

537
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:11,015
...is stuff like this included
in the terms you agreed to...

538
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,517
...in exchange for your
15 percent pay raise,

539
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,488
and extra 100,000 dollars
for your research?

540
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,503
See, what did I tell you?

541
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,569
I warned you that something
like this would happen.

542
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:26,874
I told you that you'd have to
sell your conscience away.

543
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,876
That's not it, so don't make
baseless assumptions.

544
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:29,843
You're denying it now?

545
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,181
Please, just...

546
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:37,017
...leave me alone for a bit.

547
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,493
It goes without saying
that you should do this...

548
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:50,403
...when it comes to other things
but something like a death certificate...

549
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,538
...shouldn't have its facts altered
due to outside influences.

550
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:55,559
You know that, right?

551
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:59,540
If you find your resolve shaken...

552
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:03,343
...even just a little because of that...

553
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,681
I really...

554
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,357
...may end up truly,
truly disappointed in you.

555
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:18,559
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

556
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,460
The police are outside.

557
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:22,362
This person killed my father.

558
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,264
Excuse me! Doing this here is illegal!

559
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,667
-Let go!
-And this is a hospital!

560
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,003
If you want to protest, you need to get
permission at the police station first!

561
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,238
This person killed my father!

562
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,639
He's Dr Kang Dong-joo, and he works here!

563
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:33,774
-Hey!
-Please read it over!

564
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:34,875
I told you, you can't do this!

565
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:36,043
This person killed my father!

566
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,611
He's Dr Kang Dong-joo, and he works here!

567
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,580
I'm not leaving! Let go!

568
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:09,789
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:10,677 --> 00:40:11,979
What are you doing?

570
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,081
Ma'am, why are you...

571
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,733
That Kang Dong-joo, who works here...

572
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,425
...is my son.

573
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,102
My son did something unforgivable.

574
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,838
This is all due to my own shortcomings.

575
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,340
I guess that's why
he did something like that.

576
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,976
I apologize.

577
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,511
Please, forgive him.

578
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,380
I apologize.

579
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,452
I apologize.

580
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:55,055
Mother...

581
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,401
There's nothing left to say.
You were the one in the wrong.

582
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,492
Apologize to her, now.

583
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:07,167
Have you forgotten
how your own father passed away?

584
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,703
So how could you do that to someone else?

585
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,805
There's no excuse for what you did!

586
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:19,513
Apologize to her 100... 1,000 times
until she's satisfied.

587
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:22,015
Now!

588
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,599
Please...

589
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,635
...leave this person alone.

590
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:42,936
What?

591
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,739
But we received a report,
so I'm afraid we can't.

592
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,407
It's okay.

593
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:52,946
Leave her alone to do as she pleases.

594
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:14,768
I truly have no excuses...

595
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,204
...to offer for what I've done.

596
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,407
I wish I could go back to that moment...

597
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:26,613
...and make things right.

598
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:31,018
I'm filled with regret...

599
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,382
...and am embarrassed of myself.

600
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:38,992
You little brat...

601
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:46,834
I truly... truly apologize,

602
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:49,703
from the bottom of my heart.

603
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,742
You little brat...!

604
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,982
Bring my father back to life!

605
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,784
You little brat...!

606
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,286
Bring my father back to life!

607
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:11,625
Bring my father back to life.

608
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:18,899
Father!

609
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,442
Father!

610
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,049
Father!

611
00:43:38,685 --> 00:43:39,920
Father!

612
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,291
Father!

613
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,598
Father!

614
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,918
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

615
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,058
Isn't that Bu Yong-joo?

616
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:19,960
So that's Bu Yong-joo?

617
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:22,062
It is him! Dr Bu Yong-joo!

618
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:23,530
Why is he here?

619
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,702
Director Do. Yes, it's me.

620
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:30,804
What?

621
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:32,506
Who came to the hospital, now?

622
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,465
You can't do this, sir!

623
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,033
I told you, you can't!

624
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:03,937
I'll call you back later.

625
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,308
Oh ho.

626
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:13,280
What brings you all the way here,
Dr Bu Yong-joo?

627
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:15,616
I have something to say to you.

628
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,151
I'm sure that a phone call
would've been sufficient.

629
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,458
Why did you come all the way...

630
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,324
What the heck are you doing?

631
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:29,496
Hey.

632
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:32,699
Don't ever come back to
Doldam Hospital again.

633
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:37,237
And stop using young people to
satisfy your own greed.

634
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:41,074
Stop clinging on to
Kang Dong-joo and Yoon Seo-Jung...

635
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,141
...and trying to mess with them,
you little brat...

636
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:46,932
Because from this moment on,

637
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,584
I won't just sit and watch.

638
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:51,518
You got that?

639
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:02,963
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

640
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:09,570
What the heck are you trying to do
by toying with some kids, at your age?

641
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:13,774
Pathetic little brat...

642
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:21,849
DEATH CERTIFICATE

643
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:36,930
This is...

644
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,234
...your son's death certificate.

645
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,378
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

646
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:12,900
And this...

647
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,738
...is a recording of the
surgery on your son that I performed.

648
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:20,874
It will definitely
be sufficient evidence.

649
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,877
And if you need my testimony to...

650
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:28,916
...uncover the truth, by any chance...

651
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,705
...please feel free to call me anytime.

652
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:45,933
My wife wants me to tell you
that she says "Thank you."

653
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,250
I apologize...

654
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,254
...for getting this to you so late, ma'am.

655
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,226
Oh, it's okay.

656
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:20,427
We're satisfied enough with knowing
the truth behind our son's death.

657
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:22,669
Thank you!

658
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,539
Thank you!

659
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,165
What the heck is this?

660
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,902
CAUSE OF DEATH: DEATH FROM DISEASE

661
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:57,905
Kang Dong-joo... is he out of his mind?

662
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:02,509
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!

663
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,550
Are you insane?

664
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:05,972
Have you lost your mind?

665
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,715
What the heck are you trying to do, here?

666
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:10,918
All I did was do as I was taught.

667
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:17,491
"A patient's death certificate
is the last bit of courtesy..."

668
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:20,227
"...that a doctor can extend
toward the deceased's family."

669
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,614
Why can't you get what
I'm saying through your thick skull?

670
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:27,334
Director Do's orders were to
nip this matter in the bud.

671
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:31,138
Do you not know what it means to
defy Director Do's orders?

672
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:32,339
I'm fully aware!

673
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,708
And...

674
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:38,545
...I'm aware of how debasing
it'd be to obey him, too.

675
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,481
Is it that hard to
let just one matter slide?

676
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:47,020
I just didn't want
to be caught in the act.

677
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,423
What?

678
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,658
And...

679
00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:55,295
...I thought this might be
an okay place to act as if...

680
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:58,866
...I were actually a decent guy.

681
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,502
That's what I thought.

682
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:07,708
About Doldam Hospital, I mean.

683
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:12,980
By that, are you implying that
you don't care if you never...

684
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:15,549
...go back to the main hospital?

685
00:50:16,884 --> 00:50:19,004
Are you confident that
you'll never regret doing this?

686
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:22,823
Perhaps.

687
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:46,313
I'm sorry you had to see that side of me.

688
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:51,552
Did you think a job that entails
saving lives would be that simple?

689
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:55,622
A lot of things can happen
when you have a job like that.

690
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,195
I don't think I'll be able
to go back to the...

691
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:03,230
...main hospital for the time being.

692
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:08,035
Well, the hospital you're at now
doesn't seem half bad.

693
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:13,473
And... I quite liked that young lady
you called "Dr Yoon."

694
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,876
Young lady I called "Dr Yoon"?

695
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:17,945
You know.

696
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:21,215
The one you call
"Dr Seo-Jung," or something.

697
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,189
The doctor who works in the ER.

698
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:26,854
How do you know Dr Seo-Jung, Mom?

699
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:30,891
You really don't remember anything?

700
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:34,695
Did you really black out completely?

701
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:36,697
What happened?

702
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:42,135
If you're curious, go ask her yourself.

703
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:44,204
You may be my son and all,

704
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:47,140
but I really don't want to
say this out loud.

705
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:50,844
Wait, why are you smiling?

706
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:52,179
Huh?

707
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:29,216
Did you see off your mother well?

708
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,084
Yes. Of course.

709
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,821
And you gave the deceased's family
the death certificate?

710
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:37,357
Yes. I did.

711
00:52:44,898 --> 00:52:46,133
Dr Yoon. About yesterday...

712
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,503
One shouldn't talk about
what people did when they were drunk.

713
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:53,740
That's basic drinking etiquette.

714
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:05,052
But you know, you lost your chance at...

715
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:07,664
...getting a 15 percent pay raise andextra
100,000 dollars for your research.

716
00:53:07,754 --> 00:53:09,356
And you turned your back on Director Do...

717
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:11,543
...because of the incident
with the death certificate.

718
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:15,195
So going back to the main hospital
will be difficult for the time being.

719
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:17,731
Oh well.

720
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:21,602
It looks like you're stuck at
this cruddy excuse for a hospital for now.

721
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,638
Yes, exactly.

722
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:28,375
I lost all those great offers and...

723
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,777
...my chance at returning
to the main hospital.

724
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:33,180
Thinking about spending this
long, long winter...

725
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:36,950
...at this cruddy excuse
of a hospital for now...

726
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:39,620
...makes me feel frustrated already.

727
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:45,993
So... go out with me, Yoon Seo-Jung.

728
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:52,432
Seriously...

729
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:58,772
I can't?

730
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:05,746
I can't go out with you, Dr Yoon?

731
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:08,916
No.

732
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:10,517
You can't.

733
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:17,991
And what's the reason?

734
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:22,496
I want to know why you keep avoiding me.

735
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:24,898
Can't you tell me?

736
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,968
No, I can't.

737
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:33,640
But you like me too, Dr Yoon.

738
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:35,943
Am I wrong?

739
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:40,914
Am I wrong?

740
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,919
Three strikes and you're out, right?

741
00:54:47,254 --> 00:54:48,856
You have one more chance left, then.

742
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,030
What are you doing there?

743
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:32,699
Huh?

744
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:36,703
Oh, I was just heading to the ER.

745
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:53,587
Yes, Father?

746
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:56,123
There's something you must do for me.

747
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:00,060
What?

748
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:02,874
You set a date for me
to be admitted to the hospital?

749
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,131
Yes.

750
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,533
We've finally decided on a date.

751
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,538
You can come in tomorrow afternoon
whenever it's convenient for you.

752
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:15,375
Will we go straight into surgery
after that, then?

753
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:20,981
We'll be checking on your body's condition
for two or three days first.

754
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,518
Oh, with those fancy gadgets
that I bought you, right?

755
00:56:25,252 --> 00:56:28,455
Yes, with those fancy gadgets
that you bought us.

756
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:34,061
If the test results come out okay,
we'll do the surgery early next week.

757
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:36,430
It's a simple procedure,

758
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,499
so you won't have to be
hospitalized for too long.

759
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:47,140
Make sure you're one of the doctors
performing that surgery.

760
00:56:47,508 --> 00:56:49,643
But I'm a general surgeon. How can I...?

761
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,513
That's for you to figure out, obviously!

762
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,047
You have a brain, don't you?

763
00:56:55,649 --> 00:57:00,621
Make sure you report each and
every thing that happens in there to me.

764
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:04,525
I must know everything.

765
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:22,142
Oh, really?

766
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:23,329
Yoon Seo-Jung is doing that?

767
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:26,213
She's been reading books related
to this ever since that day.

768
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,200
I'm quite proud of her.

769
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:30,150
I thought it'd be good for you to know.

770
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:31,485
Oh, yes.

771
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:34,188
Have you decided on
a team for the surgery yet?

772
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:37,357
I do have a rough idea in my mind, but...

773
00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:45,332
...I'm going to think about it for...

774
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:48,802
...a few more days before
I finalize the roster.

775
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,037
I see.

776
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:55,309
It'd be nice for Dr Yoon to
get an opportunity this time around.

777
00:57:56,243 --> 00:57:59,580
That's just my opinion, though.

778
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:01,915
I'll be hanging up now, Nurse Oh.

779
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:06,854
What brings you here?

780
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,829
What? What is it? Go ahead.

781
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:24,471
Regarding Chairman Shin's
artificial heart surgery...

782
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,574
You can't even call it
a full-blown surgery, really.

783
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,710
We're just swapping out the batteries.

784
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:34,081
May I be your main assistant
during that surgery?

785
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,989
But you're a general surgeon.

786
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:46,827
I observed a heart transplant surgery
once when I was an intern.

787
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:49,663
After that, I've observed
one aortic valve surgery...

788
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,832
...and four cardiovascular
bypass surgeries.

789
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:53,367
I've also observed one ECMO surgery.

790
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:55,936
And I've assisted in
two of the surgeries I've observed.

791
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:58,705
But if you come in as my main assistant,

792
00:58:58,772 --> 00:59:00,908
you'll be stealing that opportunity
from Yoon Seo-Jung.

793
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:03,110
Are you aware of that?

794
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:07,114
Is it... not possible then?

795
00:59:15,455 --> 00:59:17,224
Aren't you looking forward to it all?

796
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:23,463
Who will end up on
Teacher Kim's surgical team?

797
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:25,599
Who knows?

798
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,602
We may not know...

799
00:59:28,669 --> 00:59:30,971
...but those who will be
chosen sure are lucky.

800
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:08,459
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
