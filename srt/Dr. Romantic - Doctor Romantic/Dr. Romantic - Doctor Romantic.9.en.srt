EPISODE 9

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,190
What brings you here?

3
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,533
I heard that you were being interrogated.

4
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,769
I'm sure that it hasn't ended yet.

5
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:33,197
How dare you try to do the chairman's
surgery in your lowly position?

6
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,361
Look at you...

7
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:39,231
Looks like you'll lose another precious
disciple because of your stubbornness.

8
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,561
Geez...

9
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,341
Why, you little brat...

10
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,617
Doctor!

11
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,171
You have a guest.

12
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,581
A guest?

13
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,781
Teacher Kim!

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,595
I'm here.

15
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:07,973
I heard you told me to admit
myself to the hospital.

16
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:15,001
I contacted the chairman with the
news just as you told me to, sir.

17
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:22,241
Why are you just standing there?

18
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,931
Hurry up and escort me to my room.

19
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,333
Who told you to do something
stupid like this?

20
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:43,226
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.

21
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,149
I think that there's been a mistake here.

22
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,191
We're not ready to accommodate
you here yet.

23
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:50,401
What?

24
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:51,858
Dr Kim...

25
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,605
You've come such a long way.

26
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,619
I'm sorry to have to send you
back like this.

27
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,668
We'll admit you as soon as we're ready.

28
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,006
What are you doing right now?

29
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,741
Didn't I tell you that you're suspended?

30
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,686
Suspended?

31
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:11,413
Hey... hey.

32
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:15,329
I cannot allow you to treat any patients
until we're done with our investigation.

33
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:19,558
And if you disobey us, you could
suffer an even worse punishment.

34
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,788
Who the heck are you brats?

35
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,229
What do you mean, he's suspended?

36
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:24,760
Says whom?

37
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,978
Let me explain, Mr Chairman.

38
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:28,168
What happened is...

39
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,245
Look here, Teacher Kim.

40
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:32,566
You explain this.
Tell me what's going on here, exactly.

41
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:33,992
And who are they?

42
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,519
The hospital is under investigation
right now, Mr Chairman.

43
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,278
Hey, hey, hey, Kang Dong-joo!

44
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,088
We have no idea why the main
hospital sent investigators down here

45
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:47,358
to us and we have no idea why
they're putting pressure on us, either.

46
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:48,988
Hey. Be quiet.

47
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:50,448
Why should I be quiet?

48
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,098
We're the ones being treated unfairly
when we didn't do anything wrong.

49
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,014
Kang Dong-joo!

50
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:58,058
Sir...

51
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:01,298
You're the Chairman of the Geosan
University Hospital Foundation, correct?

52
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,438
Could I possibly complain about the

53
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:11,838
main hospital pressuring
Doldam Hospital like this for no reason?

54
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,118
Manager Joo.

55
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:21,978
Yes, Mr Chairman?

56
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,448
Call Director Do, now.

57
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:24,728
Mr Chairman...

58
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:28,806
Tell him to come down here now and
explain this situation to me in person.

59
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,033
Right now!

60
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,063
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,168
Tell me what I did wrong.

62
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,918
Why did you call the chairman here?

63
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,444
I couldn't just sit and watch while
Seo-jung was being treated unfairly.

64
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,378
And I figured that we needed someone
to resolve this situation for us.

65
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,828
Do you really think that Chairman
Shin will be the one to resolve this?

66
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:59,148
To be honest, the only one who can
pressure Director Do is the chairman.

67
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:04,228
Furthermore, Chairman Shin is
on your side.

68
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:09,107
If I'd known that you were such
an idiot before...

69
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:13,178
But you know, you really are ignorant
to the ways of this world, aren't you?

70
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,068
You're really naive, huh?

71
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,338
What?

72
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:18,808
What?

73
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,736
Chairman Shin has summoned me?

74
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,509
Yes, but...

75
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:26,200
You needn't put yourself through
the trouble, sir.

76
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:29,848
I'll just watch over the situation
and do as I deem fit, sir.

77
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:32,958
No, there's no need.

78
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,518
Pardon?

79
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,328
What do you mean by that, sir?

80
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:41,208
Our opponents just gave us a light
jab to see how we'd respond but

81
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:45,671
you took that as an opportunity,
and thus escalated the situation.

82
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:54,888
I was actually wondering how that
old man would find out about this.

83
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,065
Good.

84
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,188
They've set the stage for us themselves.

85
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,678
All I have to do now is go and
report the facts to him.

86
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,798
Well, this might actually end up
being a good thing for you.

87
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,608
You'll score some points with
Director Do, at the very least.

88
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,824
Even though Yoon Seo-jung is screwed...

89
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,468
Aren't you being a bit too harsh, sir?

90
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:16,578
What do you mean, she's screwed?

91
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:20,698
You have no idea what kind of
person Director Do really is, do you?

92
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:25,748
He'd be willing to do anything and

93
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,938
everything to get what he wants.

94
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,848
And Chairman Shin is someone
who made a guy like him the

95
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,618
hospital's director and sits idly by
while reaping the benefits from that.

96
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:40,798
He's on my side? Give me a break.

97
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:44,060
He doesn't need me.
He needs my operation.

98
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,630
That's all he cares about!

99
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:47,698
You fool.

100
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,888
We received word that Director
Do Yoon-wan is on his way here.

101
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,698
What are you planning to do?

102
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,547
I'll just have to bear it.

103
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,768
And if worst comes to worst,
I'll let them do what they want.

104
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,410
Well, there's not exactly anything
that I can do for you...

105
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,537
But have this when your blood
sugar gets low.

106
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,903
How did you come to know Bu Yong-joo?

107
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:58,238
Were you introduced to him
by someone, or...

108
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,768
He saved me. Twice.

109
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,808
Can you be a bit more specific?

110
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:10,333
One time, he saved me while I was
passed out in the mountains.

111
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,922
And one time, he treated my wrist
when it had almost lost functionality.

112
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,657
That's how he saved me twice.

113
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:21,903
Wait, no.

114
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,568
He saved me one other time, too.

115
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,928
I survived this time around
because of him, too.

116
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:33,268
So he's saved me three times now, then.

117
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:39,118
Do you still have random moments
in which you feel like you wish to die?

118
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,392
I'm asking you if you still get sudden
urges to commit suicide.

119
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,035
An age in which people ignore
others' pain.

120
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,872
People who don't care about others'

121
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:01,832
pain as long as they can get what
they want.

122
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,372
People who don't care about such

123
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:10,050
things, as long as they can maintain
authority, and...

124
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:14,519
I asked you if you still have any
suicidal urges.

125
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,878
It's all your fault.
It's all because of you that I died.

126
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:27,668
People who can't even get a good
look at the nature of their own pain.

127
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,218
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:43,091
Because all of them justify themselves,
saying that they didn't have time to

129
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:46,480
worry for others when they had
their own situation to deal with.

130
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,468
EPISODE 9
The Limits of Goodness

131
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,648
It's bad enough that those inspectors
barged in here so early in the morning

132
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,058
but now the Chairman of the Foundation
and Director Do are involved, too.

133
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,648
What in the world is going on?

134
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:30,353
Maybe that Chairman Shin guy
called Director Do to yell at him?

135
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:32,413
I have no idea.

136
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:36,498
We even heard that Teacher Kim
isn't allowed to work for the time being.

137
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,872
I heard that this all happened
because of Dr Yoon Seo-jung.

138
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,298
Return to your positions and get
back to work!

139
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,948
Don't make things worse
when the situation is already bad.

140
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,838
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

141
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,679
Don't worry.

142
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:08,809
All you need to do is act as you
did before, as if nothing happened.

143
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:10,488
You know that, right?

144
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,016
Why do you keep doing these
unnecessary things?

145
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:37,528
I told you to send equipment here,
not some darned inspectors.

146
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,688
Please don't misunderstand my
intentions, Mr Chairman.

147
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:45,064
I've even sent important people from

148
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,468
the main hospital down here to obey you.

149
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,532
However...

150
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:50,801
However, what?

151
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:55,820
I heard that things at this hospital are
a bit messier than we'd realized.

152
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,618
Go on.

153
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,988
They must have managed this place
so poorly that a person broke into the

154
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,558
OR and held someone hostage with
a sickle.

155
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:08,639
That's not all.

156
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,618
They even left that criminal alone with
a patient who had been operated on.

157
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,328
And because Teacher Kim was the
one to handle the situation,

158
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,403
nobody was hurt.

159
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:18,298
And they performed an expensive

160
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:21,968
treatment on a patient who cannot
pay for it.

161
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,985
Saving the patient is our priority.

162
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,708
The hospital bill can be taken care
of after that, Director Do!

163
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:29,333
And how are you going to explain

164
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:34,618
the fact that the doctor who ordered
the treatment has PTSD?

165
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,323
PT what? What's that?

166
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,388
It refers to post-traumatic stress
disorder, sir.

167
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:44,128
Dr Yoon Seo-jung made a full
recovery two years ago.

168
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:48,818
I heard that there was a drug overdose
incident involving her recently.

169
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:54,873
And Director Yeo and Bu Yong-joo
were both aware of that.

170
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,709
Yet, they were keeping it hidden.

171
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,938
As such, these two have been
negligent of their duty.

172
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,800
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

173
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,458
What is it that you truly wish to say?

174
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,758
I can't just sit by and watch as

175
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,728
these abnormalities occur at this
poor excuse of a hospital.

176
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:53,231
That's what I truly wish to say.

177
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,779
You mustn't entrust such an important

178
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:58,358
thing as your surgery to this sorry
excuse of a hospital, Mr Chairman.

179
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,998
Please reconsider entrusting your
surgery to Bu Yong-joo, sir.

180
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:04,878
So that's what it is.

181
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:10,078
You caused an uproar just to stop
Teacher Kim from performing the surgery?

182
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,448
Watch your words, Director Yeo!

183
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:12,556
Oh, whatever.

184
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:13,670
That's enough.

185
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:14,918
Mr Chairman.

186
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:20,323
This is my surgery, and I've already
made up my mind regarding this.

187
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,534
So stop arguing about it, already.

188
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:30,925
I'll have things proceed as originally
planned, so just be aware of that.

189
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,885
And let's end things here by firing

190
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,328
that doctor who caused all this trouble.

191
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:42,918
Now stop causing such a ruckus
at this hospital.

192
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,318
We can't, Mr Chairman!

193
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,473
Dr Yoon Seo-jung is...

194
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,938
Let's just end things there.
Okay, Director Yeo?

195
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,883
Geez....

196
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:56,118
You really don't get what's going on
here, do you, Mr Chairman?

197
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:58,395
What did you just say?

198
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,282
Hey.

199
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,030
The one Director Do really wants
to fire is me.

200
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:06,198
That's what he really wants.
Isn't that right, Director Do?

201
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,138
At the very least, you must take

202
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:12,379
responsibility for letting a PTSD
patient treat people.

203
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:15,208
Oh, you got the neuropsychiatrist's
clinical notes already?

204
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:16,638
PTSD, huh?

205
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:19,648
Or did you already decide the results

206
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:23,248
of her evaluation from the start and just
have her interviewed as a formality?

207
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:28,448
You won't be able to avoid shouldering
your part of the blame, either.

208
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:34,658
The duty of ER doctors is to save
dying people, no matter what it takes.

209
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:38,128
Asking them why they used an
expensive treatment on a patient is

210
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:43,708
the same thing as asking why someone
falling from a plane used a parachute.

211
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:44,656
So?

212
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,878
Do you even know how much the
hospital will suffer in losses?

213
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:52,378
Stop giving a doctor lessons in
business administration.

214
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:56,708
You can't get by nowadays by
merely being a skilled doctor.

215
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:01,050
A doctor can only survive if his
hospital does.

216
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:08,961
Wow, you say these things and yet
you call yourself a hospital director?

217
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:11,526
No, the order is all messed up there.

218
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,006
The patient needs to survive for
the hospital to survive.

219
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,298
Those are the basic principles of
being a doctor!

220
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,196
Oh, really?

221
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,877
I didn't realize that you valued
fundamentals and principles so much.

222
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,641
Fine, then. Let's do things that way.

223
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:35,648
We'll maintain our hospital's principles
and continue with the investigation.

224
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,628
And we'll issue proper punishments
for employing a doctor with PTSD

225
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,658
after the official diagnosis comes out,
as per our principles.

226
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:45,268
Look here, Director Do.

227
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:50,008
As the one in charge of Geosan Hospital
and in an attempt to rectify this wrong

228
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:53,948
I'll do what I must to defend our
principles until the very end,

229
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:54,868
Mr Chairman.

230
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,312
Have you finished your conversation,
Director?

231
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,668
Make sure you get them good this time.

232
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,023
No matter how long this may take.

233
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:16,928
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:32,073
What is it that you wanted to say?

235
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:36,348
I'm sorry for continuing to
disappoint you.

236
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,034
The reason I became a doctor was

237
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:44,088
because I wanted to be acknowledged
by you, above all else.

238
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:51,438
Because you saw potential in me and
made me want to become a doctor.

239
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:55,558
And yet, you went ahead and
back-stabbed me instead.

240
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,608
Just let him have this one, Teacher Kim.

241
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,575
I understand that you
treasure your disciple

242
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:21,252
but you can't have this
hospital shut down just because of her.

243
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:25,322
What should we do?

244
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,898
I really don't see a way out of this
one, Teacher Kim.

245
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,914
Why did it have to be Bu Yong-joo,
of all people?

246
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,477
Why were you hiding behind
someone like him, of all people?

247
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,530
There was an incident.

248
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:00,568
And he helped me through that.

249
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:04,028
And did he tell you to hide the
fact that you have PTSD?

250
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,548
I received treatment for 3 years
and thought I made a full recovery.

251
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:10,238
I'm asking you what the heck
he told you to do!

252
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:16,748
Teacher Kim didn't do anything wrong.

253
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:21,012
It's all my fault that the situation
got this out of hand.

254
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:24,072
It's because I'm lacking and incompetent.

255
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:30,328
So... if someone needs to take
responsibility, I'll do it.

256
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:39,188
I...will quit working here.

257
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,866
That's too bad.

258
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:51,170
At the very least, I thought of you
as my own daughter.

259
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,518
I guess you never saw me as
a parent, though.

260
00:18:56,648 --> 00:19:01,088
If you had really needed help, you
should've come and sought me out.

261
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,154
Director.

262
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:04,945
Regarding Doldam Hospital,

263
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,777
I'm going to go by the book
to resolve this.

264
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,222
And as for you...

265
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,298
I don't know you anymore.

266
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,877
Are you looking for something, sir?

267
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,730
Do you want me to help you?

268
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:55,964
No, it's fine.

269
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:04,418
Um... you haven't seen Seo-jung,
have you?

270
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,622
Seo-jung?

271
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:11,628
I haven't seen her since she
dropped by the ER a little while ago.

272
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,802
Oh... really?

273
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,328
All right.

274
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:17,768
Excuse me, Doctor.

275
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,008
Do you want me to call you if I do
end up seeing her?

276
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:29,593
Could you?

277
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:30,847
Thank you.

278
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:57,518
Excuse me, have you seen
Dr Yoon Seo-jung?

279
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,008
No, I haven't.

280
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,878
Oh, really?

281
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:13,958
Has his condition improved at all,
Doctor?

282
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:18,658
Not yet, we'll have to keep
monitoring his progress for now.

283
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,728
How much longer does he have
to remain like this?

284
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,968
It almost feels like I'm clinging to
false hope.

285
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:33,548
The fees for this treatment and for
the ICU are overwhelming enough.

286
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,838
I feel like we'll only end up being
a burden to our kids.

287
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:42,097
I'm sure that things must be hard,
but please don't give up until the end.

288
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,347
And continue talking to the patient
and telling him pleasant things.

289
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:57,998
Am I really doing the right thing
right now?

290
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,438
Did Dr Yoon Seo-jung come by
here, by any chance?

291
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,618
It seemed that she stopped by
the ICU for a bit.

292
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,375
I'm not sure if she's still there, though.

293
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,108
I see.

294
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:34,448
Are we ever making the right decision

295
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:40,397
in front of our patients while they
waver between life and death?

296
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:54,161
Yoon Seo-jung!

297
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,273
What brings you here?

298
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,398
Am I someone who is perfectly

299
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:03,876
prepared to take responsibility for
someone's life?

300
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:08,478
What do you mean, you don't see
Yoon Seo-jung around anywhere?

301
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:11,847
We looked everywhere for her
today, but we can't find her anywhere.

302
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:13,088
She won't pick up her phone, either.

303
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:18,008
I think she heard about you being
suspended from duty back in the ER.

304
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:22,528
-Oh, Teacher Kim.
-Yeah?

305
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:23,728
Yoon Seo-jung stopped by my

306
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,658
restaurant not too long ago and
wanted me to give you this.

307
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:33,546
Letter of Resignation

308
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,009
A letter of resignation?

309
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:38,608
When did she give this to you?

310
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,038
About 10 minutes ago.

311
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:53,930
TEACHER KIM

312
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:09,964
Where are you headed?

313
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:16,857
She's not picking up?

314
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,426
Of course she wouldn't.

315
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:22,078
If she even wrote a letter of resignation
she's really made up her mind about this.

316
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:26,548
Go and get her back here.

317
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:28,988
How would he know where to look?

318
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:31,198
Regardless of that, we have to
start searching first.

319
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:35,188
But...bring her back by the end of today.

320
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:37,578
If you can't bring her back by
the end of today,

321
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:42,022
I really will accept this letter.
You got that?

322
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,218
Oh, Dr Kang Dong-joo!

323
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:54,248
Good thing I ran into you.

324
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,888
Your car just got here, so...

325
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:57,788
That's great.

326
00:24:57,878 --> 00:24:59,088
Well, actually...

327
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,714
I'm busy right now. Let's talk later!

328
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:05,052
That's... a new car.

329
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:30,548
We're here.

330
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:32,257
Where are you planning to go?

331
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:34,778
I don't know.

332
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:38,252
I did come all the way out here,
but I feel a bit lost now.

333
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,958
Maybe I should take this chance
and go to Seoul?

334
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,468
Or maybe I should go to the East Sea
and enjoy the Oceanside?

335
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,308
You have nowhere else to go?

336
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:50,938
No, I don't.

337
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,338
And there's nobody for you to meet
up with?

338
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:54,098
No, no one.

339
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,538
What a hard life you have!

340
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:58,902
I know, right?

341
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,886
It seems bad from the surface,

342
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:05,048
but it's actually a lot worse than
you'd think.

343
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,358
Can you not say things like that
so casually?

344
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:09,588
That makes you look so insensitive.

345
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:13,418
Isn't it better to seem that way
than to seem pitiful?

346
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,228
Well, if you're going to Seoul,
I'll drive you.

347
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,228
Aren't you going to the hospital?

348
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:22,938
I'm taking my monthly day off.

349
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:24,192
Your monthly day off?

350
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:25,848
His monthly day off?

351
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,748
Dr Do In-bum is taking the day off?

352
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:29,137
Yes, that's what he said.

353
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,648
Then call Kang Dong-joo and tell
him to take over.

354
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:37,018
Dr Kang was on duty last night
so he's not working today.

355
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:38,613
Call Teacher Kim, then!

356
00:26:40,318 --> 00:26:41,662
Did you forget?

357
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:46,798
Teacher Kim was ordered to be
off duty from today.

358
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:51,438
Wait, then I'm the only general
surgeon at this hospital now?

359
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,558
Yes.

360
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,653
Looks like things ended up this
way somehow.

361
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,368
Dr Jung! Please come here.

362
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:02,918
Geez, it hurts!

363
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:05,078
Wait just a bit, ma'am.

364
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,608
Doctor, over here, too!

365
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,938
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable...

366
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,235
Seo-jung?

367
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,408
Hey, how would I know?

368
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:33,948
I just saw her for the first time in
five years!

369
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:35,078
Hey, Dr Jung!

370
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:36,618
Are you done treating the patient
with the right lower quadrant pain?

371
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,648
Hey, I'm busy with a patient.
Talk to you later!

372
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:39,978
I'll check right now!

373
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:53,838
JERK KANG

374
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,998
Do In-bum. It's me, Kang Dong-joo.

375
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:06,733
Go ahead.

376
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:07,819
What do you want?

377
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,748
You said that you knew Seo-jung
from before, right?

378
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,351
I have to find her right now.

379
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,548
Do you know where she might have gone?

380
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:19,718
She's next to me right now.

381
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,418
You're on speakerphone.
Say what you need to say.

382
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,728
Where are you right now?

383
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:31,738
We're on our way to Seoul.

384
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:34,468
Turn your car around right now and
come back to the hospital.

385
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:36,028
That's going to be a bit difficult.

386
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:38,028
I'm already on the highway.

387
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,338
Are you listening?

388
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,452
I know it's hard for you right now.

389
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:50,878
I know that, but... come on.
A letter of resignation?

390
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:52,748
You wrote a letter of resignation?

391
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:55,655
Turn the car around right now.

392
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:57,465
Come back. Dr Yoon!

393
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,490
Hey, why did you tell him that
I was with you?

394
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:30,298
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

395
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,694
And why did you tell him that
we're heading to Seoul?

396
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,158
Well, he asked me where I was.

397
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,998
Why did you write a letter
of resignation?

398
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:41,644
None of your business.

399
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,578
Just drive properly.

400
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:45,878
Wow, you sure are coming
on strong, Sister.

401
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,413
I told you, I'm not your sister!

402
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:50,578
Seoul?

403
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:51,648
Where in Seoul?

404
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:53,060
I don't know the details.

405
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,918
I'm just following them there for now.

406
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:58,818
Hey, aren't you a bit too tight on
time to drive to and from Seoul?

407
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:00,758
But still, I have to do as much as I can.

408
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:02,548
All right, then.

409
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:05,458
But you know, things are kind of
crazy back here, too.

410
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:11,605
We all forgot because of Director Do,
but today is Friday.

411
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,138
What are you doing?

412
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,656
I told you to bring a suture set and
lidocaine here!

413
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:20,578
It's been barely 10 seconds since
you asked me to do that.

414
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:21,838
Ugh, seriously.

415
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:25,178
I'm not someone to be treating
people like this!

416
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,878
You should take off your necktie.

417
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:30,178
You concern yourself with doctors'
neckties now, too?

418
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,088
Nurse Park!

419
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,288
Whoa, whoa!

420
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:36,348
Are you okay?

421
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:38,084
Please lie down.

422
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,228
Do you think that it may be
something you ate, ma'am?

423
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:45,023
I had cold rice and soup this morning.

424
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:48,062
But I guess I ate it really fast.

425
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,108
My insides are killing me.

426
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,538
And you didn't have any diarrhea?

427
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:55,667
My stomach is rumbling,
but I haven't had diarrhea yet.

428
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,248
I just vomited a couple of times.

429
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:00,848
Are you feeling pain anywhere else?

430
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:02,888
My chest hurts a little.

431
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:06,528
It may be due to esophageal
damage from vomiting a lot.

432
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:09,758
It seems to be just stomach pain for
now, so we'll give you an injection.

433
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:12,798
Give this patient some metoclopramide
via IV, and hydrate her.

434
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:13,775
Yes, sir.

435
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:20,868
It's okay. I can do it.

436
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:21,908
I'll get her cleaned up.

437
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:24,068
You hurry and give her the injection.

438
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:25,498
Thank you, Ms Yeon-hwa.

439
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,071
What are you doing?

440
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:43,518
Oh, I thought there was something
on her neck.

441
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,418
We have an emergency patient
who was in a traffic accident!

442
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:50,768
She's bleeding from her right calf,
and her BP is 90/60.

443
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,138
And it's falling quickly!

444
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:54,738
Darn it, I'm going to go crazy!

445
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,638
Yes, this is Doldam Hospital's ER.

446
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:58,708
Yes. Yes, I understand.

447
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:00,708
A person who attempted suicide
will be here in 5 minutes.

448
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:02,038
They jumped off the Yeong-gye Bridge.

449
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,138
What?

450
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:21,164
Ms Woo Yeon-hwa?

451
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,240
What are you doing?

452
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:25,628
Nothing.

453
00:32:27,198 --> 00:32:28,245
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,418
You're not working today?

455
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:52,069
Well, the folks from the main hospital
told me not to.

456
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:54,388
You do know that today is Friday, right?

457
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:01,620
We have an ER specialist from the
main hospital here now, too.

458
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:05,404
And even the chief of the surgical
department is down here now.

459
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,578
So why are you so worried?

460
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:09,443
Those people are doctors, too.

461
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:13,148
It's a patient who attempted suicide!
He fell off a bridge!

462
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:14,688
Doctor!

463
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,608
Please come over here!

464
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,318
You call yourself a board-certified
ER doctor?

465
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:20,778
Do your job properly!

466
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:25,258
Oh, yes.

467
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:27,818
Do you think that Dr Yoon Seo-jung
will come back?

468
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,910
Well, I did what was necessary though...

469
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:53,458
I'm so happy!

470
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,196
Don't you feel an endorphin rush
just from looking at this?

471
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,567
Are you serious?
You're eating pizza with a fork and knife?

472
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,851
Come on, you're being rude to the pizza!

473
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:19,638
You're supposed to hold pizza in
your hand, like this.

474
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,803
And give it a big old bite!

475
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:24,685
Got it?

476
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:28,048
You're a mama's boy, aren't you?

477
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:31,158
You've never just rolled in the dirt to

478
00:34:31,248 --> 00:34:33,801
have a good time or disobeyed your
parents, have you?

479
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:36,498
My gosh, "disobedience"? What's that?

480
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:37,997
Is it something you can eat?

481
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,738
Were you always this chatty?

482
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,828
Me?

483
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:43,428
No.

484
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,608
I tend to be more quiet and stoic.

485
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:48,408
Who's the one who's been talking
all by herself for all this time, then?

486
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,178
Well, that's because you chose not
to say anything.

487
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:52,813
I didn't want there to be an awkward
silence.

488
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:55,918
I'm just being considerate to you,
to help you avoid feeling awkward.

489
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:57,608
Are you sure it's not because you
feel uneasy?

490
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:01,118
Um, why would I feel uneasy?

491
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:05,788
Aren't you worried, now that you've
left after writing a resignation letter?

492
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,013
And I bet that you're concerned that
Kang Dong-joo called, too.

493
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:11,686
And the fact that you're here with
me now concerns you a bit too, right?

494
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:16,188
And you're just saying anything that
comes to mind so I don't find out.

495
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:19,821
Whatever. Let's eat.

496
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:28,827
Yeah, I'm worried to death.

497
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:32,858
I couldn't even say a proper farewell
to those people, who were like family

498
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:35,328
to me and I feel so bad about running
off after just leaving a letter behind

499
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:36,358
that I feel like I'll die.

500
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,024
Why did I do that?

501
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:46,404
I should've been more persistent
and begged him to spare me.

502
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:49,248
Why did I go and write that letter
of resignation?

503
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:53,668
I have nowhere to go but Doldam Hospital.

504
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:03,225
I... really have nowhere else to
go but there.

505
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:11,279
So why did you get scared and run off?

506
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:14,018
Nothing has been decided yet.

507
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,116
It's not like that psychiatrist's
report has been released yet.

508
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,848
And that patient undergoing TTM
hasn't died yet, either.

509
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:23,416
Am I wrong?

510
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:37,208
DIRECTOR'S SON

511
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:43,388
JERK KANG

512
00:36:46,018 --> 00:36:48,058
DIRECTOR'S SON

513
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:51,728
JERK KANG

514
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:54,858
Hello?

515
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,156
Where are you?

516
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:58,368
Are you still with Dr Yoon?

517
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,295
Give the phone to Dr Yoon.

518
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,467
Hurry up and give the phone to her!

519
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:06,764
I'm afraid I can't do that.

520
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,145
What?

521
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:12,262
She ran off while we were eating.

522
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:15,168
She said she suddenly remembered
something that she had to do.

523
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,628
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

524
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,868
Hello, Doctor.

525
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:34,955
What brings you all the way here?

526
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:39,273
I came here because of the question
I couldn't answer for you before.

527
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,260
You're a bit too late for that.

528
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,269
I just sent my report to the Director.

529
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:47,844
I've never had that though.

530
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:56,311
I've never once thought that
I wanted to die.

531
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:01,826
Not when my mom died.

532
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:08,423
Not when I got into the accident
with Dr Moon.

533
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:14,800
I...wanted to live,
even through all that.

534
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,374
That's why I was so miserable.

535
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:26,727
Because my desire to live was

536
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:31,583
stronger than the guilt I felt for being
the only one to have survived.

537
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:35,139
Because, despite all that,
I wanted to live.

538
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:39,816
And I felt so bad about feeling this way.

539
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:49,756
Dr Yoon Seo-jung, why did you
become a doctor?

540
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,683
Because I thought that, if I became
a doctor...

541
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:04,312
I'd be able to have my existence
acknowledged by someone.

542
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:08,181
Did you ever have a moment in which
you wanted to quit being a doctor?

543
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:12,889
Every single time...

544
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:21,993
I had to make a decision for the
sake of the patient.

545
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:25,909
I see.

546
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:35,718
Could you give this to Teacher Kim
at Doldam Hospital?

547
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:42,422
It's my report regarding your
mental health evaluation.

548
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,867
I thought it'd be good for your
hospital to have a copy, too.

549
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:47,792
Goodbye, then.

550
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:08,901
This patient's outburst was due to
stress from this past year.

551
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:13,760
She does not exhibit the DSM5
defined symptoms related to PTSD.

552
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:16,246
Furthermore, there is no need for
her to be supervised closely.

553
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:17,777
This little brat...!

554
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,585
I've handed my report over to
Dr Yoon myself.

555
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,148
Fortunately, I was able to hear the
answer that I wanted to hear from her.

556
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:34,541
I almost did something quite
immoral as a doctor.

557
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,399
Is Hyun-ji doing well?

558
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:45,223
You still remember my child's name?

559
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:47,077
Hey, of course I do.

560
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:51,619
She was the youngest patient that
I'd ever had.

561
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:55,422
You know, about Doldam Hospital...

562
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:59,354
I think I understand why you're
remaining there.

563
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,217
Please do a proper evaluation of her.

564
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:07,529
This is a life-and-death issue for
Seo-jung, as a doctor.

565
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:13,028
Please give her a proper evaluation,
despite what Director Do said.

566
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:16,324
Dr Yoon is someone we must have
at Doldam Hospital's ER.

567
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:21,706
Please don't screw her over with
a false evaluation.

568
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:23,078
Here.

569
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,578
These are thank-you-letters that
Dr Yoon's patients have given her.

570
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:30,214
I thought you may want to refer to
them as you write your evaluation.

571
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,583
We'll entrust our Dr Yoon to you,
then, sir.

572
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:38,818
If you write anything strange,
we'll file an appeal against you.

573
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:43,504
Please don't do something to make you
ashamed to face her, doctor to doctor.

574
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:50,544
Well, they're all such strong willed
people.

575
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:57,852
Don't lose to Director Do this time.

576
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:03,319
I'll be going, then.

577
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,190
Thank you.

578
00:43:35,728 --> 00:43:37,024
How did you know I'd be here?

579
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:39,638
I just received word, so I rushed here.

580
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:42,803
What about you?

581
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:46,968
Did you take care of everything you
needed to?

582
00:43:49,308 --> 00:43:50,120
Yeah.

583
00:43:58,288 --> 00:43:59,536
All right, then.

584
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,098
Let's head back now.

585
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:14,433
You're not coming?

586
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:26,758
Are you crying?

587
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:28,103
No!

588
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:32,177
It's just so cold out here.

589
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:37,440
You know how if you suddenly walk
into a bright or cold place...

590
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:40,708
You know how it is. You tear up.

591
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:44,209
It's just that, is all.

592
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:52,087
Oh man, it's so cold! Right?

593
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,408
Huh?

594
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:11,728
Is this the first snowfall of the season?

595
00:45:13,498 --> 00:45:14,419
It seems that way.

596
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:17,072
It's pretty.

597
00:45:20,038 --> 00:45:21,383
Yes, it is.

598
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,114
Your hands are cold.

599
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:03,547
I'll hold your hand just until it
warms up.

600
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:08,642
That's okay with you, right?

601
00:46:43,118 --> 00:46:44,639
But you know...

602
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:49,919
Isn't today Friday?

603
00:46:57,268 --> 00:47:00,005
Ugh, seriously!

604
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:03,046
Why did they bring me to the hospital?

605
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,050
Just let me die, already!

606
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,558
Darn it, I want to die!

607
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:14,066
Hey, how can you say that when
we barely brought you back?

608
00:47:15,278 --> 00:47:17,936
Geez, I have lost my inspiration.

609
00:47:18,988 --> 00:47:20,559
I want to draw something,

610
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:24,351
but I haven't been able to for
three years now!

611
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:27,801
If you can't help me draw again,
just leave me to die!

612
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:29,898
-Why?
-Hey.

613
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:34,042
Mr Go!

614
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:35,468
Please let go!

615
00:47:42,538 --> 00:47:47,141
This is why I told you to take off
your necktie in the ER.

616
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:49,699
-Hey, Dr Jung!
-Yes, Chief?

617
00:47:49,948 --> 00:47:51,174
You take care of him.

618
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:52,884
I can't do this anymore!

619
00:47:57,597 --> 00:47:58,533
Sir!

620
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:01,138
Teacher Kim is in the ICU right now!

621
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,278
Why? What's he doing in there?

622
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,864
He's... just sitting there.

623
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:10,346
What should we do?

624
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:11,775
What do you mean?

625
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:14,119
He's just sitting.
What do you want me to do?

626
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:15,642
-Hey, Nurse Ji.
-Yes.

627
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,255
Can't you see what's going on here?

628
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,549
Don't you see how chaotic it is in
here right now?

629
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:22,716
Not a single person is helping me out.

630
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:44,245
Ma'am. Ma'am?

631
00:48:45,238 --> 00:48:46,306
I'm going to die.

632
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,607
It seems that she has a lot of gas
trapped under her skin.

633
00:48:56,588 --> 00:49:00,128
Miss. Miss, please...

634
00:49:00,258 --> 00:49:02,468
What's the matter? You can't breathe?

635
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:04,168
Miss!

636
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:08,428
Doctor! Doctor!

637
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:10,959
Doctor!

638
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:16,437
Miss.

639
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:28,193
Doctor. Doctor!

640
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:25,567
Ms Yeon-hwa.

641
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:28,095
Nurse Park.

642
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:31,109
Go and get Teacher Kim.

643
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:34,964
He should be in the ICU.

644
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:36,252
Go get him now.

645
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:37,548
Quickly.

646
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,338
The Seoul region, Gyeong-gi-do
Province, and in the mountains of

647
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:50,038
the Gang-won-do Province have
seen their first snowfall of the season.

648
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:51,308
The snow stopped after an hour or

649
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:55,578
two but there will be
a chilly breezestarting tonight...

650
00:50:55,668 --> 00:50:58,078
I'm glad that there won't be
a heavy snowfall, at least.

651
00:50:58,168 --> 00:50:58,978
Isn't that right, sir?

652
00:50:59,068 --> 00:51:00,418
You can't be too sure.

653
00:51:00,638 --> 00:51:02,624
Snowfall at night is the worst!

654
00:51:03,078 --> 00:51:05,950
The roads just freeze over, like icicles!

655
00:51:26,298 --> 00:51:29,878
Man, what's with this snow?
It's making it harder for us to work!

656
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:31,455
Let's just finish this up quickly and go.

657
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:35,648
Oh man, it's quite slippery!

658
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:36,962
Be careful.

659
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,703
Why is the road this slippery?

660
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:12,903
-The ER?
-Yes, Doctor.

661
00:52:13,178 --> 00:52:14,810
There is a problem there.

662
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,390
I think you'll need to head there
for a bit.

663
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:43,349
This seems like subcutaneous emphysema.

664
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,556
And this young lady did this?

665
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:48,249
Yes, we believe so.

666
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:53,321
What were the doctors doing that
they missed this, huh?

667
00:52:58,588 --> 00:53:01,064
All right.
Give this patient antibiotics first.

668
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:04,497
Call Chief Song and contact Dr Nam, too.

669
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:07,178
Tell him that we've scheduled
an emergency surgery.

670
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:08,183
Yes, sir.

671
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:15,115
Hey, you punk!

672
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:16,625
Keep it down!

673
00:53:17,548 --> 00:53:20,015
I can't diagnose the other patients
properly because of you!

674
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,638
Oh... you're here, sir?

675
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:28,721
Just receive treatment quietly and
head home, all right?

676
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:30,269
Yes, sir.

677
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:35,508
What... what just happened?

678
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:38,355
This guy is a regular at our ER.

679
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:42,838
He says that he's a webtoon artist,
but I've never seen his work.

680
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,232
Oh man, what do I do?

681
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,798
Um, I think you'll need to disinfect
this spot here.

682
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:52,953
Get me a dset, please!

683
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:07,451
-Ms Woo Yeon-hwa.
-Yes?

684
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:11,277
Can you explain to me what
happened with that patient out there?

685
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:18,288
We should be there in 20 minutes.

686
00:54:19,238 --> 00:54:21,305
I wonder what Teacher Kim will say.

687
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:23,452
Isn't it obvious?

688
00:54:24,648 --> 00:54:26,786
He'll probably say, "You idiot."

689
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:34,450
"How are you going to be a doctor
when you're so weak like this?"

690
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:36,952
"You still call yourself a doctor
after doing this?"

691
00:54:38,428 --> 00:54:40,989
"Wait, no, you're not.
You're just a helper!"

692
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:45,503
"How dare someone like you just
hand me a resignation letter?"

693
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:48,384
What are you doing?

694
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:51,594
Oh, that was bad, wasn't it?

695
00:54:54,379 --> 00:54:56,112
Don't ever do that again, Yoon Seo-jung.

696
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:03,420
Don't disappear without
a word ever again.

697
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:04,786
Okay?

698
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,896
Look at you, messing with me
again, I am your senior.

699
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:10,469
Don't do it, okay?

700
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:19,491
Fine, whatever.

701
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:22,343
I'll let you off the hook just for today.

702
00:55:25,938 --> 00:55:26,760
Huh?

703
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:33,903
You said that you were Chinese.

704
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:37,297
-Is that right?
-Yes.

705
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:38,624
Are you a medical student?

706
00:55:39,618 --> 00:55:42,619
Ms Yeon-hwa, we're not
trying to scold you.

707
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:44,403
We just want to know the truth.

708
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,322
You must answer our questions honestly.

709
00:55:52,698 --> 00:55:55,983
Doctor, Chief Song won't
pick up our calls.

710
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:02,047
He won't pick up his cell,
and he's not at the hospital, either.

711
00:56:03,478 --> 00:56:06,003
To the city. To the city, please.

712
00:56:06,478 --> 00:56:08,790
I think he's left work.

713
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:11,677
Left work?

714
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:13,669
What is wrong with him?

715
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:16,168
He's well aware of the situation
at the hospital right now, too!

716
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:17,735
So how could he just leave?

717
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:41,323
All right. I'll take over for today.

718
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:43,211
Please prepare the patient for surgery.

719
00:56:43,388 --> 00:56:44,628
Will you be all right, sir?

720
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:48,199
We're not in a situation to be
discussing that now.

721
00:56:49,158 --> 00:56:50,033
Get her ready, please.

722
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,628
So you disobeyed us.

723
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:05,070
I definitely told you what would
happen if you ignored our command.

724
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:09,411
Nurse Park.

725
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:13,226
Get the patient to the OR, now.

726
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:14,970
And prepare her for surgery.

727
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:16,252
Yes, sir.

728
00:57:17,618 --> 00:57:19,053
Stop right there!

729
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:22,364
Are you going to take responsibility if
something bad happens to the patient?

730
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:24,898
-Get out of the way!
-It seems that you're trying to wiggle

731
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:27,805
out of this by using the patient as
an excuse but I can't let you do that.

732
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:30,278
I told you to get the heck out of the
way, now!

733
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:31,838
And I told you that I won't!

734
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,239
Why, you little brat...

735
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:00,945
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

736
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:04,428
No, I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

737
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:07,077
What about you? You're not hurt?

738
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:08,447
Stay in the car.

739
00:58:08,638 --> 00:58:10,113
I'm going to check what's going on.

740
00:58:26,876 --> 00:58:28,406
What's the matter? What is it...

741
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:30,558
There's only one way to know if
a doctor is doing a proper job.

742
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:31,998
Through the way they
treat their patients.

743
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,631
That's the only way.

744
00:59:33,758 --> 00:59:36,768
So is this the "painting" that you
were working on, Teacher Kim?

745
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:38,598
It's just a sketch for now.

746
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:40,438
What do you think about Bu Yong-joo?

747
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:42,038
You think he's a good person?

748
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:44,138
Or do you think that he's
a genius doctor?

749
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:46,248
Are all of those people going
together, too?

750
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:47,508
What do you think?

751
00:59:47,606 --> 00:59:49,062
Want to team up with me?

752
00:59:49,241 --> 00:59:52,978
I'll have to look into it starting now.
