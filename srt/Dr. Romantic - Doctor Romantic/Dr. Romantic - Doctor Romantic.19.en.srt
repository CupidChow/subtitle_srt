1
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:02,682
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,189
EPISODE 19

3
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,191
Can you tell me, Doctor?

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:30,931
Why did you push back
my father's surgery back then?

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,004
I asked you why you pushed back
my father's surgery back then.

6
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:49,449
Back then, I just thought
the hospital told us that they'd waive it.

7
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,685
What is it?

8
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,554
Was there more to it than just that?

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,392
I heard that your son caused over 200,000
dollars in damages at the ER alone.

10
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,395
Yes, it was probably around that much.

11
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,566
That truly would've been an incredible sum
of money 14 years ago.

12
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,769
But you didn't have to pay anything?

13
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,538
We did undergo a police investigation
and all that.

14
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,709
But later on, we ended up
receiving a call like that.

15
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,179
They said they'd cancel the lawsuit and
would not ask for reparations.

16
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,681
All of the sudden?

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,716
Without any reason?

18
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,984
I don't know.

19
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,721
It may have been because
my child's father died at that hospital,

20
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,123
or because my child had been
young back then.

21
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,927
At any rate, that's how we
got through that incident.

22
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,430
That's all I know about it.

23
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,798
I see.

24
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,868
Okay, then.

25
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,204
Thank you for the meal.

26
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,507
Oh, yes.

27
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,876
Your son's name is...

28
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,776
Pardon?

29
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,512
Kang Dong-joo, right?

30
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:56,817
He used to work at Geosan University
Hospital but is now at Doldam.

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,991
Do you know what the easiest thing
to do in the world is?

32
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,860
Destroy relationships.

33
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,665
You don't need to use any money
or effort to make that happen.

34
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,168
Just one simple sentence is
more than enough.

35
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,177
"You're being deceived right now."

36
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,946
Back then,

37
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,116
the person who wasn't treated
due to the VIP patient was...

38
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,054
...my father.

39
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,294
Were you aware of that this entire time?

40
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,346
Yes, I remember it perfectly.

41
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,416
I was on duty that night and had
a patient with an aortic dissection,

42
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,419
and another one who'd had
myocardial infarction.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,922
They'd come in within
five minutes of one another.

44
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,291
Then...

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,597
...was the person who decided to let
my father die...

46
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,000
...and operate on
the VIP patient first instead...

47
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:27,307
not Director Do, but you, by any chance?

48
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,378
That's right.

49
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,016
I'm the one who made
the decision regarding that surgery.

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,756
It has been reported that
there's only a 1 percent chance...

51
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,821
...that someone with type-A aortic
dissection will die within an hour.

52
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,330
On the other hand,

53
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:55,972
the chance that a myocardial
infarction patient will die...

54
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:58,906
...within an hour is 99 percent.

55
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,541
And that patient arrived
within five minutes,

56
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,242
after the dissection patient did.

57
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,911
If you'd been me,

58
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,848
which patient would you have
operated on first, Kang Dong-joo?

59
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,620
It wasn't because he was a VIP.

60
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:18,091
I made that decision based on
whose medical emergency was more urgent.

61
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,793
That's the truth.

62
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,504
Did you call Dr Yang
from Jungil Hospital?

63
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,172
Yes.

64
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,576
He said he'd be here within 10 minutes.

65
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,479
Leave the colitis patient in
Dr Nam Do-il's care.

66
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,249
And have Dr Yang take care of
the aortic dissection.

67
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,383
Yes, Doctor.

68
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,385
I'll go and tell him that.

69
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,531
Do you think you'll be okay to operate on
someone in that state?

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,538
If you don't think you can,
have Do In-bum take charge, instead.

71
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,274
I'll do it.

72
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,612
I said I will perform that surgery.

73
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,746
Really?

74
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,014
Can you really handle it?

75
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,218
Don't worry about me.

76
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,659
Just don't let another
aortic dissection patient die this time.

77
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,494
Dr Kang.

78
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,140
Okay.

79
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,477
I won't.

80
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,725
Can you follow after him, Nurse Oh?

81
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,528
Please.

82
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,431
Okay.

83
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,749
Are you okay, Kang Dong-joo?

84
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,091
Father...

85
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,360
Father!

86
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,728
How?

87
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,831
How?

88
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,169
-Cut.
-Cut.

89
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,972
I'd be nothing but a corpse without
my romanticism.

90
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,808
Good job.

91
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,715
What?

92
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,744
How?

93
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,817
Kang Dong-joo.

94
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,685
I asked you if you're okay.

95
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,956
I'm going to finish this surgery first.

96
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,195
I'll think about it after
I'm done with the surgery.

97
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,965
About whether or not I'm okay.

98
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,712
We'll trim the part of the intestine where
necrosis has already occurred...

99
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,217
...and we'll decide
whether we'll remove it or reconnect it.

100
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,285
Scalpel.

101
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,114
A Righteous Person
and an Untrustworthy Person

102
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,717
What are you guys doing when
an injured person is lying there?

103
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,353
We have some patients whose
conditions are much more urgent.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,689
There's a shard of glass stuck in
my husband's stomach!

105
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,225
How could there possibly be a more
urgent case than this?

106
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,161
Yes, he is in critical condition.

107
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,465
But us, ER specialists, can't make
decisions about who gets operated on.

108
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,968
Transfer him to another hospital
if you can't operate.

109
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,437
There aren't any hospitals that
can operate on him

110
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,771
within an hour and half.

111
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,275
We've been here for over an hour now!

112
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,248
Dr Kang, it's a call
from Dr Jung at the ER.

113
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,782
What is it, Dr Jung?

114
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,618
Hey, Dr Kang.

115
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,720
How much longer do you think
that surgery will take?

116
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,621
Why?

117
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,923
About the patient with
the abdomen-penetrating injury.

118
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,592
His guardian is quite angry...

119
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,095
...that others are getting surgery
before her husband.

120
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,797
Can't you work a bit faster?

121
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,334
I told you to explain to her that
these patients are more urgent.

122
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,670
I did, but she's still really angry.

123
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,174
It'll take at least an hour longer,
even if I work fast.

124
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,142
Yeah, I'm sure,
since you just opened him up.

125
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,144
Okay.

126
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,083
Why, I never...

127
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,320
Dr Kang, take your time, and don't rush.

128
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,089
If Teacher Kim finishes quickly,
he can take care of that patient, instead.

129
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,925
No, I'll take care of it.

130
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,863
We'll have to cut out this portion
from here to here.

131
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,131
I'll speed things up.

132
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,132
Gouge.

133
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,308
Hey.

134
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,043
Gauze!

135
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,313
Hey, where's the blood coming from?

136
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,548
I think I ruptured a mesenteric artery.

137
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,916
Hemostat.

138
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,221
I'll be using the hemostat,
so please prepare some ties.

139
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,995
Dr Jung wanted to know about
the progress of the dissection surgery.

140
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,399
The guardian of the patient
with the abdominal injury is...

141
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,069
...complaining about her husband
not receiving surgery.

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,438
Pump on.

143
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,547
Number eight forceps.

144
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,819
Doctor?

145
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:22,089
Cut.

146
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:22,995
Cut.

147
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,895
Cut.

148
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,801
Cut.

149
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,597
Okay.

150
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,533
What are we supposed to do next?

151
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,501
We wait for the patient's
body temperature to fall,

152
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,603
and put the patient into
circulatory arrest.

153
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,606
Now we wait until the patient's
body temperature falls to...

154
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,008
...75.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

155
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:41,914
Yes, Doctor.

156
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,981
I don't think Teacher Kim's surgery will
be ending any time soon.

157
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,351
He really hates being disturbed while he's
in the middle of a surgery.

158
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,352
Really?

159
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,556
Are you not taking my words seriously?

160
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,025
How long are you going to
leave him like that?

161
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,393
Geez, this is driving me crazy!

162
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,728
Man, this is driving me crazy!

163
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,397
Geez.

164
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,469
Hey, why can't you find it?

165
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,573
Found it.

166
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,309
Ties.

167
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,320
Cut.

168
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,226
Cut.

169
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,456
I'll release the hemostat now.

170
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:33,927
There is no bleeding.

171
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:34,995
Are his vitals okay?

172
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,297
His heart rate did get a bit faster,
but he's okay.

173
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,198
Let's continue.

174
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll perform a functional end to end
anastomosis now.

175
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,134
GIA.

176
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,173
We'll put him into arrest now.

177
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,442
There won't be any selective perfusion,

178
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,711
so we must finish within 30 minutes.

179
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,346
Pump on.

180
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,429
Can I get the GIA one more time?

181
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,325
Scalpel.

182
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,692
Suction.

183
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,928
Metzenbaum scissors.

184
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,336
Specimen.

185
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,576
Specimen.

186
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,913
-Speculum.
-One more, please.

187
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,918
Okay. Graft.

188
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,303
Cut.

189
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,371
Cut.

190
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,407
-Cut.
-Cut.

191
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,409
Please prepare the Hemovac.

192
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,877
Irrigation.

193
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:00,881
-Cut.
-Cut.

194
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,150
Okay.

195
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:04,384
Clamp.

196
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,755
Raise the pump rate slowly.

197
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,757
I'll put the Hemovac in
and finish things up.

198
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,061
Full flow.

199
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,864
Raise his body temperature.

200
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,735
That took 28 minutes, Doctor.

201
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,306
You didn't disappoint today either,
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

202
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,774
We'll finish up within 10 minutes,

203
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,944
and then go right into the surgery for
the abdomen-penetrating injury patient.

204
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,447
Tell the ER to prepare the next patient.

205
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,515
Okay.

206
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,718
Cut.

207
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:38,919
Cut.

208
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,689
Yoon Seo-Jung.

209
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,593
I've prepared the proximal area,
so try stitching it up yourself.

210
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:47,767
What?

211
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:48,962
Me?

212
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,365
It'll take a while for the patient's
body temperature to go up,

213
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,333
so take your time,
and be slow and precise.

214
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,570
I'll assist you, so come here.

215
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,392
No 4 forceps.

216
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,343
Cut.

217
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,250
Cut.

218
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:57,798
Cut.

219
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:58,705
Cut.

220
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:01,935
That's the way.

221
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,073
Get the air out of there,
and take off the clamp now.

222
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,743
Clamp off.

223
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,758
Good job.

224
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,140
The surgery ended well.

225
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,074
I see.

226
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,477
He had an obstructed blood vessel
in his intestines, which led to necrosis,

227
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:45,479
so we cut about 30 cm of it out.

228
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,681
That, that much?

229
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:51,618
We'll have to treat him with medication
and monitor his condition.

230
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,953
Thank you.

231
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,955
Excuse me.

232
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:55,923
Yes?

233
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,394
The surgery did go well, right?

234
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,367
Yes.

235
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,532
When I was signing
the surgery consent form,

236
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,602
they told me that the surgery could
take two hours, or even longer.

237
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,706
But it took you less than an hour and
a half, so by any chance...

238
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,342
The duration of the surgery itself
doesn't mean much.

239
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,647
I did my very best, and we finished
the surgery without any problems.

240
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,516
Thank you!

241
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,684
I'll be going now.

242
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,656
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.

243
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:43,864
There are more surgery patients
than I'd imagined.

244
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,175
You didn't know?

245
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:57,084
This hospital is pretty famous
around these parts.

246
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,587
The doctors here are skilled,

247
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,390
and sometimes...

248
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,392
...they even let you pay
your bill later on.

249
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,261
That's the type of place this is.

250
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:14,034
It seems that you had heart surgery, sir.

251
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:14,968
Huh?

252
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,506
How did you know that?

253
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:24,244
My heart isn't too good, either.

254
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,680
So I know your struggle.

255
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,922
IN SURGERY

256
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,363
There were no serious bowel injuries
based on the CT scan,

257
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,299
so all we have to do is patch it up.

258
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,333
Okay.

259
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:47,601
I'll get started now.

260
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:48,602
Scalpel.

261
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,626
It's all cold.

262
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,404
MOTHER

263
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,612
-Hello?
-Hello?

264
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,947
Isn't this Kang Dong-joo's cell phone?

265
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,183
Yes, it is.

266
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,218
Hello, I'm Yoon Seo-Jung.

267
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:42,289
Oh, so you're "Dr Seo-Jung."

268
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,959
Dr Kang Dong-joo is in surgery right now.

269
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,661
Is it something urgent?

270
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:50,464
No, no, it's nothing like that.

271
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,069
My Dong-joo is okay, right?

272
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,305
Of course.

273
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,573
He's fine.

274
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,642
That's fine, then.

275
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,278
It's just been a while
since I last spoke to him.

276
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,345
I see.

277
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,380
Oh, yes.

278
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,751
How are the side dishes
that I brought over?

279
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,686
Oh, the side dishes and the kimchi?

280
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,806
It's been quite some time
since they disappeared.

281
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,691
To be honest,

282
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,260
I ate most of them since
they were so delicious.

283
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,762
I'm sorry, Mother.

284
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,365
I mean...

285
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,633
Mrs Kang.

286
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,303
No...

287
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,671
Mother?

288
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,875
I'm so sorry!

289
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,644
I have no idea what I should call you.

290
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,547
Of course you should call me "Mother."

291
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,416
"Mrs Kang" is a bit...

292
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,284
...austere, right?

293
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,219
Right!

294
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,821
"“Mrs Kang" isn't quite right,
is it, Mother?

295
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,327
Should I send some more side dishes?

296
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,628
Oh, really?

297
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,264
I really loved your burdock dish!

298
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,365
Really?

299
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,266
What else?

300
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:04,705
The stir-fried anchovies and
the fish cake stir-fry were great, too!

301
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,474
Do you like seasoned black beans too,
by any chance?

302
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,043
Oh, of course!
I only wish I had some here!

303
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh yeah.

304
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,615
Gangwondo Province is famous for
its glutinous corn.

305
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,949
Shall I send you some?

306
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,419
I feel bad for just receiving food without
doing anything in return.

307
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:24,858
DONG-JOO DUMPLINGS

308
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,852
Is that why you helped me back then?

309
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,955
I'm talking about the day
I wreaked havoc in the ER.

310
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,725
You knew that I was
the son of someone who'd died,

311
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,561
because you didn't prioritize him.

312
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,497
Is that why you were so kind to me...

313
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,500
...and even treated my injuries?

314
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,807
What is it that you want to
hear from me, exactly?

315
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,843
Even once...

316
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:22,649
...have you ever regretted
the decision you made back then?

317
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,819
Because despite everything,

318
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,526
a person died due to the choice you made.

319
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,923
Have you ever...

320
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,595
...regretted making that decision?

321
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:38,131
I had to decide between a patient
who was dying right before my eyes,

322
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,935
and another one whose death
I couldn't predict.

323
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,673
And even thinking back on it now,
after all these years...

324
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,945
I believe that I had no other choice
to make, but that.

325
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,415
I see.

326
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,557
So why do I feel this way?

327
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:12,933
My brain understands what the heck
you're saying to me.

328
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,503
But why do I feel like you deceived me?

329
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:26,446
I, as a doctor, completely understand
the situation you were in back then.

330
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:35,689
But why is it that the part of me,
who is my father's son...

331
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,058
keeps on feeling angry about this?

332
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,532
That's not something
you should be asking me.

333
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:50,304
That's something you should
be asking yourself.

334
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:56,577
You're not a weak child who lost
his father anymore.

335
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,681
You're a doctor now.

336
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,059
Why did you say that to Kang Dong-joo?

337
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:48,962
On that day,

338
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:53,667
you didn't know that
the dissection patient had come in first.

339
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,603
You didn't know, which was why you
operated on the VIP patient.

340
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:02,509
Well, I would've chosen to do
the same thing even if I'd known.

341
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,083
Telling him
that I didn't know back then...

342
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,486
...wouldn't have been
of any comfort to him.

343
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:15,389
It'll only sound like an excuse to him.

344
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,561
What are you going to do if he
turns away from you forever?

345
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:23,964
You just barely shaped him up into
a decent disciple, too.

346
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,704
Instead of telling the truth,
which can sound like an excuse,

347
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:35,209
it's sometimes better to be cold,
even if it may be hurtful.

348
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,179
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

349
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:41,715
These are the details of
the articles that...

350
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,217
...the PR team is releasing.

351
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:47,588
Okay.

352
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,555
Have them put it up just as it is now.

353
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:49,990
Yes, sir.

354
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,567
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IS NOW
THE FIRST TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM

355
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,204
ARTIFICIAL-HEART-TO-ARTIFICIAL-HEART
TRANSPLANT SURGERY

356
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,173
The director sure is amazing.

357
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,676
So this is how he's getting back at them.

358
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,413
Director Yeo!

359
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,648
Director Yeo!

360
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,116
Take a look at this!

361
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,423
I can't believe the lengths that
Director Do is going to!

362
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,320
This is such a ridiculous article!

363
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:23,357
FIRST TIME IN KOREA: GEOSAN UNIVERSITY
HOSPITAL'S AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT

364
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:32,299
I'm sorry, we're not open yet.

365
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,768
It's been a while, Nurse Noh.

366
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:36,703
I'm not sure if you'd remember me.

367
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,438
Who are you?

368
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,308
I'm Reporter Oh Sung-jae,

369
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,511
who covered Ms Jang Hyun-joo's
surgery incident 14 years ago.

370
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,315
Oh, so you were reading that article.

371
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:52,686
That surgery was actually performed by
Dr Bu Yong-joo.

372
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,756
But isn't that article a bit strange?

373
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,759
Bu Yong-joo was the one
who performed the surgery,

374
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,228
but his name isn't mentioned
anywhere in that article.

375
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:06,266
He blamed everything on
Bu Yong-joo 14 years ago,

376
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:10,137
but now, you can't find
Bu Yong-joo's name anywhere.

377
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,006
What do you think about that?

378
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,478
I have nothing to say.

379
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,214
I won't write an article.

380
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,349
I don't have a recorder on me,

381
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:25,652
and I won't write anything down in my pad.

382
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:31,992
Please, just tell me
what happened back then.

383
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,863
Tell me only the truth.

384
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,334
What's so important about that?

385
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:43,704
The important thing is to stop the rumors.

386
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,074
That article about
the chairman is spreading,

387
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,243
so we can't just let it
continue to circulate.

388
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:54,481
But it'd tarnish our image to include
Doldam Hospital in the article.

389
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:58,185
Still, how dare you steal Teacher Kim's
surgical accomplishment like this?

390
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,889
Don't be too disappointed in me,
Director Yeo.

391
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:07,828
I did include the names of the other staff
besides Bu Yong-joo in the article.

392
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:12,799
I was actually planning on rewarding
those folks for their hard work.

393
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,903
And I'm seriously considering
bringing them...

394
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:19,673
...all over to the main hospital, too.

395
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,109
Goodbye, then.

396
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,144
I'm quite busy, you see.

397
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,680
What does he mean?

398
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,482
He'll bring them all to
the main hospital?

399
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,450
What will happen to Doldam Hospital then?

400
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,287
To put it simply, we've been screwed.

401
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,888
My thoughts exactly!

402
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,623
Teacher Kim was the talent
behind all this,

403
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,159
but Geosan is reaping all the fruits of
his hard labor for themselves!

404
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,495
And he's planning to take all
the young doctors...

405
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:43,430
...that Teacher Kim trained, too!

406
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,700
Shouldn't we meet up and
prepare some countermeasures, too?

407
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:47,701
How?

408
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:49,703
Let's make Teacher Kim aware
of this fact first.

409
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,672
-Let's do that, and...
-He already knows.

410
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,041
Does he know?

411
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,275
And what did he say?

412
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,678
Oh, just let it be.

413
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,780
How could we possibly do that?

414
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:03,383
We're the ones who worked hard,
but they want the spotlight!

415
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,153
What are you so worried about?

416
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,957
We have too many patients as it is,
even without that kind of recognition.

417
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,725
And we're always suffering because...

418
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,895
...there are never enough beds in the ICU.

419
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:16,530
Teacher Kim!

420
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:24,638
Do you know what the best thing
I ever did was?

421
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:28,775
It was doing away with
the name "Bu Yong-joo."

422
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,479
After I did that, weights were
lifted off my shoulders.

423
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:36,950
And after I let go of success,
I got freedom.

424
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,421
I much prefer living like this.

425
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:44,725
But, Teacher Kim!

426
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,127
All of us?

427
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,028
Yes.

428
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,763
Director Do has invited all of you.

429
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:55,836
He wants to reward all of you for your
hard work during the transplant surgery,

430
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,671
so make sure that all of you are there.

431
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,639
Okay?

432
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,442
Will Teacher Kim be coming, too?

433
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,778
You think Teacher Kim would come
when Director Do summoned him?

434
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,046
Of course he won't go.

435
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,915
If that's the case, I won't be going.

436
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,283
I have no reason to go.

437
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,450
I'll be going now.

438
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,522
I didn't even participate in the surgery.

439
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,657
So I'll be going now.

440
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,332
Well, the most important people are
you three right here, anyway.

441
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,700
You three will be coming, right?

442
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,669
Chief, I…

443
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:32,639
Oh, be on duty at the ER while
these folks are gone, Dr Jung.

444
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:33,574
Got it?

445
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:35,481
Yes.

446
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:40,747
I don't think I'll be able to.

447
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,050
I have tons of patients who need
operations and such.

448
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:44,918
Hey, Dong-joo.

449
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,720
You can't not come!

450
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,689
I'm busy too, because of the chairman.

451
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,225
I don't think I'll be able to
make time for that.

452
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:54,261
Hey, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

453
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,163
Don't be like that!

454
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:58,532
Hey, Dr Do In-bum!

455
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,433
You're not missing this too, are you?

456
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,435
Nobody else is going,
and I don't want to go alone.

457
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:04,137
I don't think that
Father will like that, either.

458
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,279
This can't happen.

459
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,480
Hey!

460
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:14,387
Chief.

461
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:19,152
Am I not a person?

462
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,888
Am I invisible?

463
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,457
When can I go home, already?

464
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:24,925
Why aren't you answering me?

465
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,495
I asked you how long you're going to
leave my husband unattended in there!

466
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,597
What do you mean,
"leave him unattended," ma'am?

467
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:31,798
We've never done that.

468
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:35,135
Why didn't you put the one
who got surgery in the ICU,

469
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,037
and leave him in there instead? Why?

470
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:37,938
As I told you before,

471
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,541
there are no more beds
right now in the ICU.

472
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:41,942
Oh, whatever!

473
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,211
Where's the doctor who's in
charge of him?

474
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,446
I'll talk this over with that doctor.

475
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,556
Did you make amends with Teacher Kim?

476
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,128
So you still don't want to
talk about that with me yet, huh?

477
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,099
Fine, okay.

478
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,435
Oh yeah.

479
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,304
Your mother called.

480
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,872
She asked if you were doing okay.

481
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,575
You talked with my mom?

482
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:18,011
Yeah, because your phone kept ringing.

483
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,245
So I picked up briefly to tell her that
you were in the middle of a surgery.

484
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,183
Was there anything else you talked about?

485
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,788
Well, we discussed side dishes
and glutinous corn, too.

486
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,625
You can manage to hold
a conversation about things like that?

487
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:32,593
Yeah.

488
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:33,894
Why?

489
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:39,032
Doctor, the patient is acting strange.
He's having spasms.

490
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,472
What happened?

491
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,341
The patient just started convulsing
all of a sudden.

492
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,709
I think it may be a spasm.

493
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,549
Give him 3 mg of
lorazepam via the IV first.

494
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:56,850
Yes, Doctor.

495
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:08,795
I've administered the drug.

496
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:10,340
You said this patient is an alcoholic?

497
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,265
Yes.

498
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,731
I think it may be delirium tremens
due to alcohol withdrawal.

499
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,970
Doctor, his heart rate is 180!

500
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,472
One more dose of lorazepam.

501
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,406
Yes, Doctor.

502
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,513
His heart rate still won't go down!

503
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,081
Give him one more dose of lorazepam,

504
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:29,850
and 200 mg of phenobarbital.

505
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:30,784
Yes, Doctor.

506
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:32,719
And 100 mg of hyoscyamine, too, please.
Hurry!

507
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:33,887
Yes, Doctor.

508
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,591
Sir. Sir!

509
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:39,526
Oh no...

510
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,030
Ma'am, please…

511
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,032
What's wrong with my husband?

512
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:48,335
Did something go wrong with
the surgery he had yesterday?

513
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:51,205
No, the part where
he received surgery is fine.

514
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:56,109
But he's displaying severe symptoms
of alcohol withdrawal.

515
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:59,046
That state is called
delirium tremens, and...

516
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,981
What? Delirium tremens?

517
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:04,718
We're doing our best to
get him stabilized with some drugs,

518
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,987
but his condition isn't stabilizing.

519
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,523
If this continues,

520
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,526
it can lead to him having a heart attack.

521
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:14,194
Oh no!

522
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:17,831
Please save him, Doctor!

523
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:21,568
I may hate him,
but I can't live without him!

524
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:22,970
Oh, Doctor!

525
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:24,304
So this is where you were.

526
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:25,205
Look.

527
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:28,108
How long are you going to keep
my husband locked up in the ER?

528
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,009
What?

529
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:29,910
I mean,

530
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:32,045
I'm pissed as it is that
his surgery was pushed back,

531
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:34,047
so why is he being overlooked for
a spot in the ICU, too?

532
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:35,048
Ma'am.

533
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,252
Didn't the head nurse explain
the situation to you, ma'am?

534
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:41,355
It's because we don't have any beds
in the ICU right now.

535
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,423
These people received surgery
before your husband did,

536
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,058
and are both in critical condition.

537
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,928
You shouldn't have accepted
those patients, then!

538
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:53,267
We had no choice because we had
two critical patients come.

539
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,169
We've told you this again and again.

540
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,437
Furthermore, your husband is doing great,

541
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,907
so I was going to monitor him overnight
then move him to a regular room.

542
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,308
Forget it.

543
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,977
Just move my husband to
the ICU right this second.

544
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,312
Right now.

545
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,480
Excuse me.

546
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,382
You really are being too much.

547
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:09,283
What did you say?

548
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:14,087
My husband didn't even receive a proper
surgery because of your husband,

549
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:17,758
and now you're coming up to the ICU and
telling him to give up his bed, too?

550
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:20,594
And just what do you mean by that, ma'am?

551
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:23,730
I heard everything you doctors were saying
yesterday, okay?

552
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:25,999
They told you to hurry up and
finish my husband's surgery...

553
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:29,136
...and just halfass it because of
this woman's husband!

554
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,070
Oh my goodness...

555
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:32,873
What the heck are you saying?

556
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,077
Thanks to your husband coming in,
my husband's surgery was pushed back!

557
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,213
You're the one who barged in here
and cut the line!

558
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,180
What did you say?

559
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,849
What the heck are you even saying?

560
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,116
-Excuse me.
-What?

561
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,352
Calm down, everyone.

562
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,488
I think you've misunderstood
something, ma'am.

563
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:50,991
I've never once halfassed a surgery.

564
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:53,493
I definitely told you that
I gave that surgery my all.

565
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,995
And you, ma'am!

566
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,764
The doctor is the person who decides
which patient takes priority.

567
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,600
Oh, whatever! I don't care!

568
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,069
Move my husband to
the ICU right this moment.

569
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,671
If you don't, I'll sue this hospital.

570
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:06,707
I told you to move him right now!

571
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,608
Doctor!

572
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:08,914
He's going into cardiac arrest!

573
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,580
Oh no!

574
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:16,517
-What's his BP?
-Get the defibrillator, hurry!

575
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,423
Yes, Doctor.

576
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,357
Oh... Honey!

577
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,327
Oh no!

578
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,771
I'll do it.

579
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,741
200 joules!

580
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,112
Step back.

581
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,113
Clear!

582
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:50,584
Oh my goodness!

583
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:53,287
Give him one gram of epinephrine
every three minutes.

584
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,221
Yes, Doctor.

585
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,524
I'll check his rhythm.

586
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:01,261
No response.

587
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,229
200 joules!

588
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:05,265
Clear!

589
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,268
Goodness!

590
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,436
Honey!

591
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:10,470
Oh no!

592
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:13,774
Let's switch. Nurse?

593
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:14,741
Yes.

594
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:24,251
Oh no!

595
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,586
Honey!

596
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,199
It's been almost an hour.

597
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
He's getting a dose of epinephrine
once every three minutes, right?

598
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,972
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

599
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:27,648
Oh...

600
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:43,597
Patient Lee Dong-soo has passed away.

601
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,266
No.

602
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,003
No!

603
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:03,784
Why did you want to do surgery on him,

604
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,153
if you wouldn't even be able to save him?

605
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:11,291
If you'd done the surgery properly...

606
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,229
...my husband wouldn't have died.

607
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,731
Bring him back.

608
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,768
Hurry up and bring my husband back.

609
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,171
Bring him back.

610
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,340
Doctor!

611
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:29,643
It wasn't because of the surgery!
It was because of his alcoholism!

612
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:34,081
I told you, he died due to
delirium tremens, ma'am!

613
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,083
He walked in here yesterday.

614
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,552
I can't believe he's gone today.

615
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:42,623
Hurry up and bring my husband back.

616
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,291
Bring him back.

617
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:47,828
Hurry. Hurry...

618
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:49,496
Oh, Honey.

619
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:51,632
Hurry and save him, Doctor!

620
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,468
Please calm down, ma'am.

621
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,004
We'll give you one final moment with him.

622
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:00,774
You should go and say goodbye.

623
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,678
Honey.

624
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:26,466
Looks like your husband can get
a bed in the ICU now.

625
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:46,053
What was with your attitude just now?

626
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,288
Why did you get angry at
the patient's guardian?

627
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:50,715
Because she kept doubting that
I performed the surgery well.

628
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,995
I put my all into that surgery.

629
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,464
I did my best and took care of
the colitis patient's surgery,

630
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,800
and did my best as I removed the glass!

631
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:04,171
It's not my fault that
there was no space in the ICU.

632
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,039
It's not my fault that he drank so much,

633
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,674
so why is she blaming my surgery?

634
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:08,642
Why?

635
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:12,145
Yes, I know.

636
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:15,616
I know you want to yell back at me.

637
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:21,154
That you had no choice but to make
that decision regarding my father.

638
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:23,891
And that you did your best as
a doctor in that situation.

639
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,259
And so!

640
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:30,931
I shouldn't blame you.

641
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,003
I'm sure that's what you're thinking.

642
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:40,140
I'm well aware of that.

643
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:45,012
I'm so well aware of that I feel like
I'll go crazy with rage.

644
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:50,817
I really want to hate you so badly.

645
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,057
But I can't even do that anymore.

646
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,264
Because I'm a doctor.

647
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:17,411
Do you know what
surgeons hear most often?

648
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:22,216
"Why did you perform surgery on them"
"if you couldn't even save them?"

649
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:27,921
And do you know what the
second most common thing surgeons hear?

650
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,990
"They were fine before,"

651
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,593
"but things went wrong after
the surgery you did."

652
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:39,666
Our job is to save lives.

653
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,602
But, unfortunately,

654
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:47,207
it's also part of the job to accept a lot
of hatred and bitterness.

655
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:49,209
Despite everything,

656
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:52,045
it's a job that entails piercing someone
with a blade.

657
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:58,519
So go upstairs as soon as you calm down,
and apologize.

658
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:03,123
You must do that in order to complete
your patient's treatment.

659
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,124
Got it?

660
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:09,630
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:17,571
I just can't bring myself to accept
what you're saying right now.

662
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,263
Dr Kang Dong-joo.

663
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,037
Let's chat for a bit.

664
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:55,876
Dr Bu Yong-joo didn't do anything wrong.

665
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,245
If he didn't do anything wrong,

666
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,782
why was he kicked out of
the hospital like that?

667
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:06,220
I'm sure it was due to
his sense of responsibility.

668
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:10,791
What do you mean,
you'll fight the hospital?

669
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,194
If I leave without saying a single word,

670
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:17,397
you people will never know
what you did wrong.

671
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:23,003
What you did wrong and
why you can't do things like that.

672
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,404
So, what?

673
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:28,275
Do you think you'll be able to
win if you fight us?

674
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:32,513
What, do you think I can't?

675
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:34,915
You'll end up hurting yourself.

676
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,618
I'm not scared at all.

677
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:38,785
I'm not talking about you.

678
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm talking about the seven staff members
who were involved with the surgery.

679
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,828
Even if you make a huge commotion
out of this incident,

680
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,297
you'll never be able to touch me.

681
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:52,099
And the people who'll be hurt
and kicked out,

682
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:54,234
will be those seven staff members.

683
00:43:57,037 --> 00:44:00,207
What kind of hospital would hire...

684
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,342
...blacklisted staff members like them?

685
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:07,948
Do you think that you'll be able to take,

686
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:10,117
responsibility for those seven lives?

687
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:15,389
Even though three of them have
families to feed?

688
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:20,093
So shut your mouth and disappear quietly.

689
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:23,030
If you're forgotten,

690
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:26,466
those people will be fine.

691
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,435
Got it?

692
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,140
In the end,

693
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,843
Dr Bu Yong-joo took
all the blame for that...

694
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:39,546
...for the sake
of those seven staff members,

695
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:41,481
and left the hospital?

696
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:45,786
Yes, as far as I know.

697
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:53,827
Why are you telling me this?

698
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:58,165
What does Teacher Kim's past have
anything to do with me?

699
00:44:58,232 --> 00:45:00,801
To tell the truth,

700
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:04,304
there was one more person
he protected then,

701
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,306
besides those seven.

702
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,944
On the day of Jang Hyun-joo's funeral,

703
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,114
a middle-schooler broke into the ER,

704
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,184
and came to wreak havoc with a bat.

705
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,723
The hospital was prepared to charge him
with destruction of property,

706
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:26,493
and told the child's mother to pay over
200,000 dollars for damages.

707
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,931
They were also prepared to charge that
middle schooler with a crime.

708
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:36,036
That was more than possible,
since he was over the age of 14.

709
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:43,610
What do you mean by that?

710
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:46,680
Haven't you ever thought that
it was strange?

711
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:48,749
That nothing happened,

712
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:51,718
despite the fact that
you caused all that trouble?

713
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:03,197
We had no courage back then.

714
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:04,665
No.

715
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,568
It'd be more suitable to
call us cowards instead.

716
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:13,707
Dr Bu Yong-joo protected
all of us and left.

717
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:17,444
And we'd been relieved by that.

718
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,782
Let me ask you one more thing.

719
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:27,754
If the person who didn't call for
a proxy surgeon wasn't Dr Bu Yong-joo,

720
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:29,623
who was it, then?

721
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,800
The Deputy Director of
the hospital at the time.

722
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,935
This person, right here.

723
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,909
If I tell you,

724
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,980
do you even have the courage to tell
the world the truth?

725
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:58,085
Create a righteous world.

726
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,521
LIST OF PROXY SURGERIES PERFORMED AT
GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

727
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:29,716
SURGICAL RECORD: JANG HYUN-JOO

728
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:45,766
What is all this?

729
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:49,002
It's a list of the proxy surgeries
that were performed.

730
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:52,739
There are some among them who were aware,

731
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:54,875
that they'd gotten a proxy surgery.

732
00:47:56,009 --> 00:48:00,214
I've even written the amount that
Geosan gave them,

733
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,616
so that they wouldn't sue.

734
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,252
What do you mean?

735
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,988
Well, it's all over now,

736
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,023
so there's nothing that can be done.

737
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:15,229
But I'm sure that this will be
a good weapon to use against Director Do.

738
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,933
Congratulations on your comeback!

739
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,201
Goodbye, then.

740
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:40,888
I wasn't able to reveal
the truth to the world,

741
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:44,625
but I wanted to give this to someone
who must know the truth.

742
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:20,327
Don't worry, Honey!
You'll get better now!

743
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,729
I'll wait right here!

744
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:39,646
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:40,848 --> 00:49:44,785
I apologize for what happened before.

746
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:55,095
But just know this one thing.

747
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:01,935
Doldam Hospital treats
all of its patients equally.

748
00:50:03,403 --> 00:50:08,842
That we're more genuinely invested in
saving patients' lives than anyone else.

749
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:11,044
It's not like I ever said that
you weren't genuine.

750
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,548
Why are you saying this when
I didn't even say that to you?

751
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:27,361
Good job.

752
00:50:40,174 --> 00:50:42,109
Oh, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung!

753
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,544
Come here for a second.

754
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:45,846
You know,

755
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:48,048
we can't just let this matter
pass by like this.

756
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:51,018
Director Do wants to celebrate
your achievements...

757
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:56,356
...so you, of all people, shouldn't treat
Director Do like that.

758
00:50:56,623 --> 00:50:59,393
But still, even Teacher Kim isn't going.

759
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,727
So we can't just go without him.

760
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:02,162
Oh, come now.

761
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:04,798
I told you, he wouldn't go
even if he were invited!

762
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:06,800
-To where?
-You surprised me.

763
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:11,338
Where wouldn't I go
even if I were invited?

764
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:13,207
Director Do told all
the staff involved with...

765
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:15,943
...the artificial heart transplant...

766
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:18,378
...to come to Seoul today.

767
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:19,913
What does Do Yoon-wan want?

768
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,448
What else?

769
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,984
To congratulate those who worked hard,
of course.

770
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:27,120
What, it wasn't enough for him to steal
credit for my work on the press?

771
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:29,890
Why is he telling these busy folks
to come to Seoul?

772
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:32,392
Oh, come on, don't be like that!

773
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:37,231
Because of you, they're all saying they
can't go, even if they want to.

774
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:38,932
Hey, Yoon Seo-Jung.

775
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,267
Is that why you didn't want to go?

776
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:41,268
No.

777
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:42,836
Not at all.

778
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:44,171
See?

779
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:45,873
She obviously is concerned about
what you may think.

780
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,508
No, I'm not, Chief Song.

781
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,210
Don't be like that, and be nice.

782
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,580
Just give them all permission to go.
Just let them go.

783
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:54,515
Okay?

784
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:58,585
He'd originally called over
Nurse Park and Nurse Oh, too,

785
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:02,456
but those folks are diehard fans of yours,
so they won't bite.

786
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,934
But why did you leave me out of this?

787
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:05,058
What?

788
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:06,927
Didn't you say it was to celebrate...

789
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,572
...the successful
artificial heart transplant?

790
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:11,632
I was the one who was
the head surgeon of that operation.

791
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:13,338
So why did you only leave me out of this?

792
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,303
Oh, don't be like that.

793
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,671
You wouldn't have come
even if we'd invited you.

794
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:19,740
Go ahead and invite me,
and see what happens.

795
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:20,707
What?

796
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:23,777
I said, try inviting me.

797
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,081
Would you like to come?

798
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:29,416
Yeah, I'd come.

799
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:30,323
What?

800
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:33,287
Go and get ready too, Yoon Seo-Jung.

801
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:37,291
Let's go and breathe in
some Seoul air, shall we?

802
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,859
That's okay with you, right?

803
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:40,928
Well, yes.

804
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,162
Let's see.

805
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:45,499
I wonder if Nurse Oh has time?

806
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:46,700
Get out of my way!

807
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:50,637
Is something wrong with him?

808
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:51,572
What?

809
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:52,472
Pardon?

810
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,508
Why is everyone so shocked?

811
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:57,845
The main hospital invited all of us to
celebrate our achievement.

812
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,748
So all of us should to go to Seoul and
be congratulated.

813
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:04,484
Go and get ready, Nurse Oh.

814
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,485
Hey, Do-il.

815
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,386
You too, man.

816
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:07,387
Section Chief Jang.

817
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,256
Would you like to come, too?

818
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,390
Me too?

819
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:11,458
Hey, Do In-bum.

820
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,126
You go and get ready, too.

821
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:17,064
What will we do about the ER, then?

822
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,300
We have Dr Jung In-soo and
Dr Woo Yeon-hwa, too.

823
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:24,972
And Chief Song can take care of
any surgeries that need to be done.

824
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:25,939
Me?

825
00:53:26,006 --> 00:53:28,275
No, I have to go to Seoul, too!
What are you talking about?

826
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:30,244
Were you the one who performed
the artificial heart transplant?

827
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,745
Well, no, but...

828
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:33,881
So you stay here and hold down the fort.

829
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,949
We can't go otherwise!

830
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,155
Hey, Kang Dong-joo.

831
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:45,559
You're coming too, right?

832
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:52,799
Yes, I'm coming.

833
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:59,139
I'll go if you go, Doctor.

834
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:00,607
That's good.

835
00:54:00,674 --> 00:54:03,577
Let's all get a nice taste of
some Seoul air, then.

836
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,179
Let's go, Nurse Oh!

837
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:06,613
Okay, then.

838
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,635
What do I do? What do I do?

839
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,070
How can I do that again?

840
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,405
What do I do?

841
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,006
Oh man!

842
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:35,943
Should I let him know?

843
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:36,877
Or not?

844
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,279
Oh, oh, whatever!

845
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,248
I can't tell him.

846
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,685
He'll tell me to stop him at all costs.

847
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,221
But how could I possibly stop
Teacher Kim?

848
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,488
Huh?

849
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:50,624
I can't. I can't!

850
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:09,977
What are you planning to do
when you get there?

851
00:55:10,043 --> 00:55:11,378
What else?

852
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:15,616
I'll do what I couldn't do 14 years ago.

853
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,218
I'll have to do that.

854
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:33,711
GEOSAN HOSPITAL PERFORMED THE FIRST
ARTIFICIAL HEART TRANSPLANT IN KOREA!

855
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,762
CELEBRATING GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL'S
FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART TRANSPLANT

856
00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:03,964
-Oh, hello!
-Hello!

857
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,332
-Congratulations.
-Yes.

858
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:09,303
Just a second.

859
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,239
Yeah, it's me.

860
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:13,207
Where are you?

861
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,341
Yes, well,

862
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:18,478
they should be almost there.

863
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,513
What do you mean, "they"?

864
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,581
Aren't you with them?

865
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:21,487
What?

866
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,350
Well, I...

867
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:26,987
...I just got enteritis, you see.

868
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:28,388
Oh, my stomach!

869
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:30,224
Oh, ow!

870
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,358
I'm sorry.

871
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:34,127
I'm really sorry, Director!

872
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:37,097
I really have to go to
the bathroom, so...

873
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:43,403
Please smile, Director!

874
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,610
Oh, sure.

875
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,207
-Let's take a photo!
-Yes!

876
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:51,345
But when will your guests get here, sir?

877
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,213
I heard that they're almost here.

878
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,781
They'll arrive soon.

879
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:03,023
-Who's that?
-Do you know who that is?

880
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:21,408
Bu Yong-joo?

881
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:31,718
"Geosan Hospital performed the first"
"artificial heart transplant in Korea."

882
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,260
Why are you here?

883
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:44,431
Didn't you say this was a party for
the artificial heart transplant surgery?

884
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:46,733
Then it's only obvious why I should come.

885
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:52,439
Because we're the main characters of
that surgery, after all.

886
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,253
Do you know what is the
hardest thing to do in the world?

887
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,489
Destroy oneself.

888
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:16,129
14 years ago, Bu Yong-joo was a coward.

889
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:20,701
And the truth was that
he didn't know how to win.

890
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,269
And he remained silent.

891
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,505
He didn't want to offer excuses
for himself.

892
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:26,240
And thus, he ran away.

893
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:31,178
By doing that, he thought that
he was taking responsibility.

894
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,614
What is it that you wish to say,
Reporter Oh?

895
00:58:35,782 --> 00:58:40,654
I think that things will be
quite tough on you, Director Do.

896
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,259
What do you mean by that?

897
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,227
So?

898
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:49,563
Are you planning to duke it out with me?

899
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,564
Why?

900
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,133
Are you nervous?

901
00:59:29,456 --> 00:59:34,960
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
