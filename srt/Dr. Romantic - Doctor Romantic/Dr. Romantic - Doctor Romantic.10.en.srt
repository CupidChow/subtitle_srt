1
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,087
Don't ever do that again, Yoon Seo-Jung.

2
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,581
Don't disappear all of a sudden
without a word.

3
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,762
Look at you, messing with me,
I am your senior.

4
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:36,182
Oh no!

5
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,617
Stop it already!

6
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,140
What's the matter? What's going on...

7
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,000
Excuse me!

8
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,290
Wake up, sir!

9
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,192
-Can you walk?
-Yes.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,828
Here, watch your step.

11
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:30,590
Is this 911?

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,830
We're on Interstate 38,
and there's been an accident here!

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,338
Yes, about a six-car collision!

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,071
Just a moment, sir.

15
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,882
-Are you okay, sir?
-I didn't do it.

16
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,950
I really wasn't speeding!

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,671
I was going really slowly!

18
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,720
This isn't my fault!

19
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,620
Calm down, sir!

20
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,902
I got it, so calm down, okay?

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,682
Oh... oh no!

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,174
Just a moment.

23
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,520
Excuse me.

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,821
Are you injured anywhere?

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,190
Do you feel any pain near
your back, neck, or other spots?

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm just a proxy driver.

27
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,800
I didn't do anything wrong!

28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,904
Can you get up, sir?

29
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,032
I'm telling you,
I really didn't do anything wrong!

30
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,744
Excuse me, sir. Can you help this man up?

31
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,710
Staying on the road is dangerous.

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,210
Please go to the side of the road.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,010
Please, get up.

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,161
Let's get you up.

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,652
Let's check the other cars, too.

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,696
I'll look over there.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,065
I'll check the ones in the front.

38
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,567
Oh... you hit me?

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,186
Did you just hit me?

40
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,693
Hey, call the police.

41
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,520
Call the police!

42
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,140
How dare you hit me?

43
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,147
Huh?

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
Do you know who I am?

45
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,350
Can't you see that
this is an emergency patient

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,644
who needs surgery?

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,649
You people always use patients as
an excuse when you're in a tight spot.

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,954
Hey.

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,924
I've been a hospital inspector
for 12 years now.

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,266
I know how you people think better
than I know the palm of my hand!

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,096
How dare you...

52
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,400
Hey, what are you doing?

53
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,560
Call the police, now!

54
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,552
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,641
This is the police, correct?

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,114
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

57
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,326
You have to hurry over here.

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,804
There's been an assault.

59
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,019
Hey.

60
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,401
You're really in for it today.

61
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,164
I won't let you off easy with
just an out-of-court settlement.

62
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,880
Doctor!

63
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,950
Big trouble, sir!

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,020
It's Dr Kang Dong-joo.

65
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,602
He says that there's been
a six car collision on the highway.

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,633
Oh my god...

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,930
How serious there?

68
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,539
There's one patient with a damaged
carotid artery that has already expired

69
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,502
and the four patients
who are still conscious

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,294
are outside of their cars now.

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,359
Including those who are unconscious,
we have about 10 injured patients.

72
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,787
What about Yoon Seo-Jung?

73
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,121
Is she there now?

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,144
Yes.

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,514
She's looking for other
injured people, just in case.

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,019
Nurse Oh.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,513
What's the temperature outside right now?

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
30 degree Farenheit. and it's due to drop
1 or 2 more degrees in an hour.

79
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,065
Hey, Kang Dong-joo.

80
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,872
Children, pregnant women,

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,030
and those with excessive bleeding
are your priorities.

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,181
Send the highest-priority people
over on the ambulances first.

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,784
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,130
And make sure to
keep the injured patients warm.

85
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,997
Make sure that the unconscious patients
are kept warm, no matter what.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,244
Do you understand?

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,484
Yes, sir!

88
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,985
Do you have anything we can
cover people with in your cars?

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,301
Just a moment!

90
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,846
Allow me to inspect you for injuries, sir.

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,148
Geez...

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,744
Do you feel any pain anywhere?

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,653
Are you okay?

94
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,680
What about you, ma'am?

95
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,156
Excuse me for a bit.

96
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,953
Oh, it's cold.

97
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,087
It's so cold.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,077
You have been drinking and driving?

99
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,406
Hey...

100
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,948
Why is it so cold?

101
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:11,237
It doesn't look like
you have any bleeding.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,763
Excuse me.

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,808
Don't move,
and just stay in the car for now.

104
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,950
Please close the door.

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,851
It's so cold.

106
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,370
Blood...

107
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,433
Oh, Eun-seol.

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,233
Eun-seol.

109
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,871
Eun-seol!

110
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,110
Eun-seol. Eun-seol, open your eyes!

111
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,246
Eun-seol!

112
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,874
Somebody, please help!

113
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,531
Help us, please!

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,569
Please help us!

115
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,433
Please help us!

116
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,093
Over here!

117
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,120
Use these.

118
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,802
Here you are, ma'am.

119
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,238
Please stay here for a moment.

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,300
Help us!

121
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,692
I don't think we'll be able to
handle this ourselves.

122
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,320
Call and ask for backup.

123
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,713
-Hurry and get the supplies out.
-Yes, sir.

124
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,820
Please, please!

125
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,220
Save my daughter!

126
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,560
Are you okay, ma'am?

127
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,530
-Please, save my Eun-seol!
-Eun-seol?

128
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,339
Please save my Eun-seol!

129
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,146
Excuse me!

130
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,240
Oh no, my Eun-seol!

131
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,703
My poor baby!

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,464
Eun-seol!

133
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,823
How old is your child?

134
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,165
How old is your child?

135
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:01,863
3 years old!

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,584
She's 38 months old!

137
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,447
Where's your car seat?

138
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,447
You put a toddler in your car
without a car seat?

139
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,601
Eun-seol.

140
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,688
Excuse me.

141
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,853
Can you hear me, sir?

142
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:44,930
Mister!

143
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:45,942
Mister!

144
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,022
You've hurt your leg quite badly, sir.

145
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,714
It needs to be realigned,

146
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,040
so I'll get someone to
help you right away.

147
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,142
So please wait here just a bit.

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,282
Wait just a moment, please.

149
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,375
Just a moment.

150
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:08,580
There's... one... more person. One more.

151
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,064
Honey, are you okay?

152
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,166
Honey!

153
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,965
Can one of you go and get the doctor?

154
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,686
My husband has chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease!

155
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,209
Please go and tell the doctor!

156
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,100
Pul... pulmonary obstructive what?

157
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,957
Honey!

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,569
Oh... oh no!

159
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,260
She seems to have internal
hemorrhaging in the abdomen.

160
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,521
Please hurry and
get her to Doldam Hospital.

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,281
Yes. Please come with us too, ma'am.

162
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,809
You have to live, Eun-seol!

163
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,135
Are you okay?

164
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,959
Yes!

165
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,805
Can you move your neck?

166
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,914
Yes!

167
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,060
Do you have any pain in your hip,
legs, or anywhere else?

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,095
No, I don't!

169
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,631
But... over there.

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,592
Excuse me!

171
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,689
Excuse me!

172
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,910
There's a patient up there!

173
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,872
He has an open fracture on his right leg.

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,614
Please hurry over to him
with something to realign it.

175
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,900
Go over there,
with a stretcher and a bandage!

176
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,477
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

177
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,654
Dr Yoon!

178
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,034
What does that look like to you?

179
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,593
It's a person, right?

180
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,486
All right, please inhale this
when I count to three.

181
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,573
One, two, three!

182
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,293
Okay.

183
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,221
I'll give you some oxygen now,

184
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,444
so just inhale slowly through your nose.

185
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,664
Okay.

186
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,749
Excuse me.

187
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,982
Back up.

188
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,410
Got it.

189
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,250
One, two, three!

190
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,124
One more time! One, two, three!

191
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,491
One more time!

192
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,930
There we go.

193
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,917
He has a lower leg crush
injury on both legs.

194
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,730
There's a lot of bleeding, too.

195
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,126
We'll have to put
a tourniquet on him first.

196
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,519
A tourniquet?

197
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,090
Will this work?

198
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,195
Yeah, one more.

199
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,264
One more?

200
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,792
Here's one more.

201
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,944
Hydration, please.

202
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,140
And get something to realign this,
as well as some fluid.

203
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,117
Yes.

204
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,747
Large bags of warm saline,
clines, Foleys, and intubators.

205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,261
Five of each, please.

206
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,050
-Empty out this hybrid room...
-Where should I go?

207
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,230
and empty all of these beds here, too.

208
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,437
And move all of the patients
in the D-zone inside.

209
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,694
-Teacher Kim!
-Yes?

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,390
The first patient
will be here in 3 minutes.

211
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,747
It's a 3-year-old female child.

212
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,722
According to Dr Kang,
she has some muscle guarding

213
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,373
around her abdomen
so she may have a seat belt injury.

214
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,608
Leave the scene of the accident in
Yoon Seo-jung's care

215
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,184
and call Kang Dong-joo to the hospital.

216
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,570
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,051
-Nurse Park.
-Yes?

218
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,584
What about the female patient with
Boerhaave syndrome?

219
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,489
Dr Nam Do-il is preparing her
for surgery right now.

220
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,453
Call Dr Yang from Jungil Hospital
and entrust the surgery to him

221
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,083
and entrust the 3-year-old girl
coming in now to Dr Nam.

222
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,138
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,263
Are you going to continue being difficult,
Dr Bu Yong-joo?

224
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,830
Seriously...

225
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,812
Hey.

226
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,801
Didn't you hear?

227
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,182
It's a six-car collision.

228
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,940
What are you trying to do here,
when people's lives are at stake?

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,026
I'm just doing my duty.

230
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,533
That's what I get paid to do, after all.

231
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,513
No, you're just on a power trip and
ignoring the situation at hand!

232
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,384
Are you going to take responsibility

233
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,680
if someone ends up dying, at this rate?

234
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,920
Well... none of this would've happened

235
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,189
if you'd just followed orders
from the beginning.

236
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,777
This is your own fault,
so you can't blame us for it.

237
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,100
Geez, you are so ignorant!

238
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,260
We have a patient!

239
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,570
It's a 3-year-old girl,
and she's unconscious.

240
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,970
Her capillary refill time is falling!

241
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,930
We'll have to get her
into the hybrid room!

242
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,419
Doctor, please save my Eun-seol!

243
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,557
Honey.

244
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,870
This person needs an orthopedic surgeon,

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,330
so please take them to a big hospital.

246
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,469
Yes, we will.

247
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,901
You two surgeons head back
to the hospital now.

248
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,821
I'll take a look at the remaining
injured patients before I go.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,785
Wait.

250
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,466
See you at the hospital.

251
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,070
Yeah.

252
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,334
See you at the hospital.

253
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,344
Geez...

254
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,733
What's the matter? Is his condition bad?

255
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,198
He drank so much that
he's throwing up now.

256
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,845
Oh... water.

257
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,863
Give me some water.

258
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,699
Water, okay?

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,857
Do you have any water, Sis?

260
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,826
What's his blood alcohol level?

261
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,346
He refuses to comply.

262
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,663
He says that he'll get
a blood test at the police station.

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,096
I said let's go.

264
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,522
Let's go, man!

265
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,677
I'll let you take my blood
at the police station.

266
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,124
Oh, really?

267
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,101
We'll do that, if that's what you want.

268
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,212
What are you doing?

269
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,023
You're pretty.

270
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,272
Wow, that was fast.

271
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,554
All done.

272
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,270
All you have to do now is to arrest him
when you get the result.

273
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,667
Oh, yes.

274
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,955
Also...

275
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,110
Don't go driving after
you've had so much alcohol.

276
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,282
That's essentially the same as
committing murder, you little brat.

277
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,131
Hey, Sis!

278
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,073
Who are you?

279
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,733
Who do you think you are,
speaking to me so harshly?

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,408
You talking to me?

281
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,924
I'm the Crazy Whale of Doldam Hospital.

282
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,306
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

283
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,573
They want you to step in for a bit.

284
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,858
Her spleen is damaged,
and the capsule surrounding it is torn.

285
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,254
-Doctor.
-Yeah?

286
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,630
We have the results of the CT scan.

287
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,726
Come over here.

288
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,471
This is the spleen.

289
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,426
You see the dark bits?

290
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,105
It means that there's bleeding there.

291
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,240
Is her condition really bad, sir?

292
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,831
Well, she is a toddler, so...

293
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,820
it's risky to even put her
under general anesthesia.

294
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,208
But if we don't operate on her,

295
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,028
she'll be in danger due to
heavy blood loss.

296
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,467
Oh... oh no!

297
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,457
Operating on children is different
than operating on adults.

298
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,230
The only person at this hospital
who can operate on her is me.

299
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,241
Well?

300
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,789
Are you still planning to get in my way?

301
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,568
Rules... are rules, after all.

302
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,687
She may be my daughter, but...

303
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,801
I can't just change the rules
all of the sudden because of this.

304
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,414
Honey!

305
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,540
Geez, you pathetic jerk.

306
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,846
Okay, then.

307
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,454
I'll do my job, so you do yours.

308
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,511
Because I have to operate on this child,

309
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,955
no matter what you choose to do to me.

310
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,323
It seems that you don't quite get it yet

311
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,552
but doctors have only one job.

312
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,770
And that job is to save the patient,
no matter what it takes.

313
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,487
All right, bring this child to the OR.

314
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,104
Yes, Doctor.

315
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,083
We need the guardian to come and
sign the consent form, please.

316
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,509
I see.

317
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,554
We have a patient!

318
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,930
This way, please.

319
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,434
This way.

320
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,296
Yes, this way.

321
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,427
This way.

322
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,410
She's a woman in her 20s.

323
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,595
She was upside down in car,
held by a seatbelt.

324
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,110
Please give her a cervical spine x-ray.

325
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,230
Yes, I will.

326
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,719
-Hey, Kang Dong-joo.
-Yes?

327
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,985
You told me there was a patient
with an open fracture.

328
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,867
What happened with him?

329
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,550
We had two patients with
lower leg open fractures

330
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,274
but one of them had a light fracture
while the other had a severe one.

331
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
They're on their way to a hospital
with an orthopedic surgeon.

332
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,278
Seo-Jung will come back after
the other patients are taken care of.

333
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,136
We have two patients in need of surgery.

334
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,549
One has Boerhaave syndrome and
one is a child who needs spleen surgery.

335
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,987
I'll take care of the child,

336
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,489
but which one of you has
experience with Boerhaave?

337
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,938
I've done it once before.

338
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,651
-With a laparoscope?
-Yes.

339
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,192
Okay.

340
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,105
Then you be the main surgeon, Do In-bum.

341
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,158
And you assist, Kang Dong-joo.

342
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,048
Yes, sir.

343
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,121
I'll go and get ready.

344
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,567
What?

345
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,060
What do you mean,
you still haven't found a hospital?

346
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,982
We've called every single
big hospital nearby,

347
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,680
but all of their ORs are full.

348
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,590
They have no beds in their ERs, either.
What should we do?

349
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,660
The patient's BP isn't too good,
and he's still bleeding out.

350
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,992
Oh man...

351
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,728
I thought you said
you've done this surgery before.

352
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,799
I'm just doing one more simulation.

353
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,620
Is there something wrong with that?

354
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,547
No. I'll go and get ready then,
Dr Do In-bum.

355
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,058
Are you ready, Dr Nam?

356
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,498
Dr Nam.

357
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,996
Yeah. Let's start.

358
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,584
Knife.

359
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,935
Trocar.

360
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,376
Scope.

361
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,804
Scalpel.

362
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,784
I'm opening up the peritoneum now.

363
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,607
Please monitor her vitals.

364
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,654
Okay.

365
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,061
Eun-seol said that
she wanted to see her dad...

366
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,246
and you said that you'd be

367
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,546
staying here longer than
you'd originally thought

368
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,173
so I packed some clothes
and other things for you

369
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,619
and we were on our way to come see you.

370
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,700
Why did you take the car seat out?

371
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,955
Because she kept telling me that
she didn't want to sit in it.

372
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,320
It's not like we knew that
we'd get into an accident!

373
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,645
Please move out of the way!

374
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,815
We have patients coming in!

375
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,920
Hey, how could you
bring orthopedic patients here?

376
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,990
What else were we supposed to do?

377
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,290
Was I supposed to leave them to die
while going from hospital to hospital?

378
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,790
Look at you,
saying unpleasant things again!

379
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,060
There were no supplies in the ambulance

380
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,480
and they're bleeding quite a lot.

381
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,700
We'll find a hospital to transfer them
to while giving them transfusions.

382
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,070
Hey, we're overflowing with
emergency patients as it is!

383
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,557
Light or heavy.
Which one do you want to do?

384
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,600
Light.

385
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay.

386
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,267
Can you hear me, sir?

387
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,970
BP is 90/60, with 120 bpm.

388
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,640
Change the drip from the
ambulance to a warm saline

389
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,719
and put one more line in him for
two total liters of hydration.

390
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,588
Yes, Doctor.

391
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,694
Scissor!

392
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,750
Please bear it for a bit, Patient!

393
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,139
I'll be cutting the bandages off.

394
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,009
Please prepare a bandage
and a splint, please.

395
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,087
Yes, Doctor.

396
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,868
I think it's this side,
but I can't see the perforation.

397
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,655
Pull the scope out a bit.

398
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,324
I told you to pull it out a bit!

399
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,899
What do you want me to do?

400
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,237
Should we call Teacher Kim?

401
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,167
Hey, Dr Do In-bum!

402
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,636
No. I'll do it.

403
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,260
I found it.

404
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,802
Here's the tear site.

405
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,326
Suture number 3.

406
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,236
All done.

407
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,033
We'll be doing the fundoplication now.

408
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,253
One more suture number 3, please.

409
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,365
Hey, how's your patient?

410
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,691
I think we'll have to amputate
both of his legs below the knee.

411
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,194
He has a severe fracture near
the back of his skull, too.

412
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,921
-Is it wide?
-About 10 palms.

413
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,310
Same with this patient.

414
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,457
He has no pulse near his foot.

415
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,038
How did it go with finding
a hospital to transfer them to?

416
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,082
I'm looking into it now,
but it hasn't been easy.

417
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,106
Ask Chief Jang to help us, too.

418
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,566
He has some personal connections.

419
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,760
Will do, Doctor.

420
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,729
All right.

421
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,776
Shall we tend to the
other guests waiting for us, then?

422
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,186
The left side...

423
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,275
and the right side.

424
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,805
The left side.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,890
I'll take care of the
right side first, then.

426
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,637
What do you mean by that?

427
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,624
Why did they bring
orthopedic patients here?

428
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,310
No hospitals would accept them

429
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,429
and their condition isn't
too good, I'm afraid.

430
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh geez...

431
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,836
Looks like Dr Yoon Seo-Jung
caused trouble again.

432
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,556
Are you still having
trouble breathing, sir?

433
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,993
I'm a lot better now.

434
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,200
To be honest, tomorrow is
our 54th wedding anniversary.

435
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,135
Wow, really?

436
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,132
You two have been together
for 54 years now?

437
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,801
My wife married me when she was 19, so...

438
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,708
Oh, stop it!

439
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,703
She's suffered a lot.

440
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,203
The doctor is in the middle
of examining you.

441
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,096
Please take a deep breath.

442
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,001
We'll give you some more oxygen and
get your breathing back to normal.

443
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,266
And what about you, ma'am?

444
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,681
Are you hurt anywhere?

445
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,460
Did you hit yourself
against something hard, or...

446
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,088
Nothing like that, but...

447
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,681
I don't know if it's because
I was so shocked,

448
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,205
but my heart is beating so fast.

449
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,252
My wife's heart hasn't
ever been too good, you see.

450
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,649
Could you give me your hand, please?

451
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,521
Your heart rate is a bit fast.

452
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,967
Does your heart feel stiff?

453
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,800
Or do you feel pain anywhere else?

454
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,066
Oh, I'm sure it's just the shock.

455
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,398
I'm fine, so please get
my husband feeling better first.

456
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,306
Please be sure to tell me
if you feel any pain anywhere. Okay?

457
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,233
Speaking of which, Doctor.

458
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,230
How old are you right now?

459
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,128
Oh, there you go again.

460
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,276
What?

461
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,300
I'm just asking because she looks like

462
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,905
she's about the same age as our youngest.

463
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,126
Please get some more rest.

464
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,251
Okay.

465
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,407
Did you call the kids?

466
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,950
I told them to take their time
since the roads are slippery.

467
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,590
Get some sleep until they get here.

468
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,244
Sure.

469
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,627
Geez, oh my...

470
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,354
Tell me the truth.

471
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,450
This was your first time
doing that, wasn't it?

472
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,536
You were lying about
having done it once before.

473
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,718
Right?

474
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,158
Well, it wasn't really a
difficult surgery.

475
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,271
And it was successful in the end.

476
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,348
Isn't that good enough?

477
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,145
You think that surgery is a joke?

478
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,966
Well, of course it's not.

479
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,718
But it's nothing to risk
your own life over, either.

480
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,143
Looks like he got you this time.

481
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,187
Right?

482
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,897
This is what you like, right?

483
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,120
Coffee with both cream and sugar.

484
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,565
Oh, yes.

485
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,693
Please, have this.

486
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,221
Thank you.

487
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,497
Excuse me, Doctor.

488
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:07,798
Have you ever thought that

489
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:10,160
you wanted to quit your job?

490
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,470
Why are you asking me that
all of the sudden?

491
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,315
When you felt like you wanted to quit...

492
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,315
how did you overcome that
feeling and get through it?

493
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,095
I was just curious.

494
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,954
Well, I don't know.

495
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,113
I feel like I couldn't quit if only

496
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,746
because all my suffering up until now
would've been for nothing.

497
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,522
And I don't have the confidence that
I'd be better at anything else if I quit.

498
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,860
Is that... all?

499
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,732
Don't you have a personal
conviction as a doctor or

500
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,135
feel like you had a personal
calling to this profession?

501
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,333
I think you'd have to work for

502
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,353
at least 10 years to have
either of those things.

503
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,217
Because talking the talk is
different than walking the walk.

504
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,758
I got a call from the ER.

505
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,902
I have to go.

506
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,049
Thank you for the coffee!

507
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,410
What's going on?

508
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,240
His BP is rising and the
bleeding is getting worse.

509
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,298
Decrease the amount of fluids and
get me a Cline and a Foley.

510
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,219
Yes, Doctor.

511
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,661
I'll take care of inserting the Cline.

512
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,727
Can I get the Foley, please?

513
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,109
Doctor!

514
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,889
The patient at bed 5 is
going into cardiac arrest!

515
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,248
Take care of the Cline here for me!

516
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,510
Yes, Dr Yoon!

517
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,531
Doctor!

518
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,454
My wife isn't breathing!

519
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,330
Can you hear me, ma'am?

520
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,413
Ma'am!

521
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,488
Get me a monitor here, please.

522
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,617
Yes, Doctor.

523
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,510
No response, and she's not breathing.
I'll move her to a bed!

524
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,110
Honey! Honey!

525
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,851
Excuse me.

526
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,463
One, two, three!

527
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,543
Connect her to the monitor and
get the supplies for intubation ready!

528
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,194
It seems that his central venous
pressure is quite low.

529
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,696
He's not excreting any urine, either.

530
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,370
If his BP keeps rising
despite him having no blood,

531
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,453
his bleeding will get worse.

532
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,805
Okay, let's hook him up to a tube.

533
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,534
Our target is getting his systolic to 100.

534
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,670
Let me know when you've put it in.

535
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,625
Yes, Doctor.

536
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,434
Get the defibrillator, hurry!

537
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,704
That's enough.

538
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,629
I told you to stop it!

539
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,042
We agreed that
we wouldn't do this, Doctor.

540
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,495
We already did the paperwork to say

541
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,606
that she wouldn't get
this kind of treatment.

542
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,007
I think he's talking about a
‘Do Not Resuscitate' order, Doctor.

543
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,094
Sir!

544
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,460
That's enough.

545
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,170
You can stop now, Doctor.

546
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,899
You sure did suffer
a lot up until now, Honey.

547
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:22,393
You must have suffered
quite a bit while living with me.

548
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,611
Woo Yeon-hwa

549
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,240
Please monitor her input and
output rates carefully.

550
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,340
And make sure you check on
her hemovac drain, too.

551
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,155
-Yes, Doctor.
-All right.

552
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,208
Her spleen is a bit damaged,

553
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:39,828
so we've moved her here but thankfully,
her condition isn't too bad.

554
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,030
We'll watch over her for a day and

555
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,193
move her to a regular
hospital room tomorrow.

556
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,102
Oh, thank you!

557
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,876
Thank you so much!

558
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,179
You can step in for a bit, if you'd like.

559
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,618
Yes, Doctor.

560
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:13,183
What...am I supposed to do?

561
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,634
I don't know what you expected
as a reward for treating my child...

562
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,870
but tell me, sir.

563
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,787
What is it that you want from me?

564
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,085
Go see your child.

565
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,520
I mean, it's good to try and
live a productive life and all

566
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,151
but let's not live bad lives
because of that, okay?

567
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,412
People need to know
what they're even living for,

568
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,461
first and foremost.

569
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,850
What do you mean by that?

570
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,655
They called one of our
orthopedic surgeons to go to Doldam?

571
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,791
Why?

572
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,823
I'm not sure about the reason, sir.

573
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,175
I only heard that it was
the decision of the inspector.

574
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,442
Get me Inspector Choi on the line.

575
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,343
Yes, sir.

576
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,930
There are two
severely injured patients here

577
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,198
due to a six-car traffic accident.

578
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,398
The situation is quite dire,

579
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,398
so I called an orthopedic surgeon
from the main hospital.

580
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,064
Hey, Inspector Choi.

581
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,762
What are you trying to do, here?

582
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,793
I'll report the details to you
once I get back to Seoul.

583
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,478
I'll be hanging up, then.

584
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,847
Yes, Director Do?

585
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,538
Where are you right now,
and what are you doing?

586
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,845
Do you even know what's going on
at Doldam Hospital right now?

587
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,495
Um... did something happen there, sir?

588
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,225
How ridiculous of you to say!

589
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,991
Are you seriously
asking me that right now?

590
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,152
Where are you right now?

591
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,780
Are you out drinking again?

592
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,363
No, sir!

593
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,623
What do you mean, drinking?

594
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,656
Of course I'm not, Director!

595
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,242
Director?

596
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,210
Director?

597
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,369
Bu Yong-joo.

598
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,841
What about Yoon Seo-Jung?
Did she come back?

599
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,446
Yes, but...

600
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,535
A patient expired not
too long ago due to cardiac arrest.

601
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,475
Are you a bit better now?

602
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,268
Yeah... it's not like this is my first or
second time to have this happen.

603
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,623
But I just can't seem to get used to it.

604
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,346
You did your best, though, Dr Yoon.

605
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,073
Isn't that enough?

606
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,351
Did I really do my best?

607
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,759
I'm not so sure about that.

608
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,359
Am I really doing this right?

609
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:11,629
Is my very best the
best for the patient, too?

610
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,524
Doctors are human, too.

611
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,140
And you're human, too.

612
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,180
I'm not sure that's a good enough excuse
for someone who's died, though.

613
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,205
Doctor.

614
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,405
Come with me.

615
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:42,928
Do you want me to come with you?

616
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,076
No, it's fine.

617
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,792
I'm sorry to have been a burden to you.

618
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,487
Go in.

619
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,954
Here, sir?

620
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,318
Hey.

621
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,545
Do you want me to embarrass you
in front of everyone, then?

622
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,940
No, sir. I'll go inside.

623
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,771
Doctor!

624
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,690
Honey, it's the doctor.

625
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,183
She saved you.

626
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:06,106
There's only one way to know
if a doctor is doing a good job.

627
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,305
Through his or her patients.

628
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,132
That's the only way to know.

629
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,584
Don't try to take responsibility for
matters regarding life and death, too.

630
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,107
All you can do is
give it your all while utilizing

631
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,327
what you've learned.

632
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,699
Just focus on that.

633
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,244
As of today, you're no longer a helper.

634
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,880
I'm going to make things
super tough on you from now on,

635
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,112
so prepare yourself.

636
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,690
Yes, I'll prepare myself.

637
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,620
Don't cry.

638
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,023
It'll make you grow on me.

639
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,160
Why are you just standing here?

640
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:54,948
Go in.

641
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,940
Oh, thank you so much, Doctor!

642
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,200
Thank you so much, Doctor!

643
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,869
Thank you so much!

644
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,810
Thank you.

645
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,170
Yes.

646
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,338
Thank you. Thank you.

So you've been working on
something interesting, I see.

651
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,974
Since when have you been sitting there?

652
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,753
It's been a while since I got here.

653
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,600
And I was doing some reading,
since I saw something interesting.

654
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,231
Is this the "painting" you're working on?

656
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,032
You broke into someone else's office
and rummaged through my things?

657
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,640
That's quite a rude habit
you've got there, Manager Joo.

658
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,428
The chairman has been curious.

659
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,706
Can't you go ahead and start now
if you have a plan this detailed?

660
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,223
This is merely a sketch.

661
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,298
And have you chosen the people
to be involved in this "sketch," as well?

662
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,830
May I ask who they may be?

663
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,008
Teacher Kim...

664
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,957
Oh, I'm sorry to have interrupted you two.

665
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,064
What is it, Nurse Oh?

666
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,660
I received word that
an orthopedic surgeon

667
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,790
from the main hospital is on the way.

668
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,417
It seems that
Inspector Choi helped us out.

669
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,441
What should I do?

670
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,137
Call our anesthesiologist, Dr Nam, first.

671
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,960
Have Kang Dong-joo and Do In-bum assist.

672
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,837
And please make preparations
for the surgery with Nurse Park.

673
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,800
And call Yoon Seo-Jung, too.

674
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,788
She's not a surgeon,

675
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,268
but it'll be a good learning experience
for her to assist.

676
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,656
Yes, Doctor. I'll do that.

677
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,043
I'll be going, then.

678
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,250
You're coming too, Dr Yoon?

679
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,627
Yep, I got a call.

680
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,690
The patient's vitals
aren't too stable right now

681
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,037
so we really have
to be ready for anything.

682
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,690
Please prepare 10 packs of RBC
and 10 packs of FFP.

683
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,700
Yes, sir.

684
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,314
Okay, let's get the patient with
two injured legs to the OR first.

685
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,691
Yes, Doctor.

686
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,490
DIRECTOR DO YOON-WAN

687
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,513
What are you doing?

688
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,655
It's nothing.

689
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,663
Go ahead, Dr Yoon.

690
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,300
All right. We'll get started now.

691
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,670
BP is 100/60.

692
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,561
I can maintain that.

693
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,129
Tourniquet on to 280.

694
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,086
Set it for 90 minutes, please.

695
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,557
Will all of these people be
working with you, too?

696
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,729
I don't know.

697
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,060
I'll have to look into it starting now.

698
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,110
-Hello.
-Yes.

699
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,826
Oh, would you like me to
wake up Nurse Oh for you?

700
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:49,025
No, it's okay.

701
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,423
Looks like she was up
all last night, huh?

702
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,340
Yes.

703
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,290
It hasn't even been an hour
since the surgery ended.

704
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,484
Oh, I see.

705
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,617
Everyone must have worked so hard.

706
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,452
That... was the best night ever.

707
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,394
I finally thought of
new characters for my webtoon!

708
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,718
I'll give you this as
a commemorative gift and go.

709
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,692
Wow!

710
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,061
Wow, it's quite cool.

711
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,388
That's nice.

712
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,273
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

713
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,633
You even came to see me yourself.

714
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,730
I wanted to apologize to you for

715
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,630
what happened before
and I wanted to report to you

716
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,636
that the issue regarding
Dr Yoon ended well.

717
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,090
It ended well?

718
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,864
How, exactly?

719
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,479
The psychiatrist's report
about her was good

720
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,489
and the patient who received the
expensive treatment is conscious now.

721
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,795
So you didn't come here to
apologize to me, per Se.

722
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,706
You came to rub all of this in my face.

723
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,940
To say that you were right,
and I was wrong.

724
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,592
That's what you came to say, right?

725
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,894
Even if this incident ended like this...

726
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,905
Director Do won't give up.

727
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,520
He has quite a stubborn streak
about him, you see.

728
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,084
I'm sure that
you're well aware of this too, though.

729
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,210
DIRECTOR DO YOON-WAN

730
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,274
He'll start with what you
consider important

731
00:54:45,924 --> 00:54:49,973
and take them, one by one.

732
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,608
Come on... pick it up quickly...

733
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:05,507
And he'll try and touch whatever
you may consider a weakness.

734
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,606
Are you still confident?

735
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,307
Take it.

736
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,822
What did you want to discuss with me?

737
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,037
And so early in the morning, at that?

738
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,462
How's the car?

739
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,302
Do you like it?

740
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,257
I heard that your car has been scrapped.

741
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,899
So I told them to get you a new one.

742
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,284
I guess you hadn't heard yet.

743
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,701
Oh man, it's cold.

744
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:03,943
What time is it now?

745
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,563
Chief Jang.

746
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,812
What are you doing?

747
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,209
I was just cleaning the trash box.

748
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:39,591
You were doing that, Chief?

749
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,612
What about Ms Yeon-hwa?

750
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,880
I believe she quit.

751
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,461
I guess the work was too difficult.

752
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,463
She just left without a word.

753
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,289
Oh, I see.

754
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,580
That's too bad.

755
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,481
You have to do even
this kind of work now.

756
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:55,134
There's nothing that I cannot do
for the sake of Doldam Hospital.

757
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,534
Well, I'm pretty much
finished cleaning up here.

758
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,269
So I'll get going now.

759
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,672
Ah, that's nice.

760
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,990
Student ID: Jang Hyun-joo

761
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,618
Geosan University.

762
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,309
Surgical Department.

763
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,121
Jang Hyun-joo?

764
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,931
What are you doing?

765
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,411
Teacher Kim.

766
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,271
I'm sorry.

767
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,504
The door was open,
so I came in for a bit.

768
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,609
What do you think about Bu Yong-joo?

769
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,899
Do you think that he's a good person?

770
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,292
Or... maybe a genius doctor?

771
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,635
Is that what you think of him?

772
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,712
I want to know why
you're asking me such things, sir.

773
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,588
I thought I'd have to know that
before trying to win you over.

774
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,695
Get out.

775
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,001
Doctor.

776
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,427
Well?

777
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,398
What do you think about
teaming up with me?

778
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,293
Get out!
