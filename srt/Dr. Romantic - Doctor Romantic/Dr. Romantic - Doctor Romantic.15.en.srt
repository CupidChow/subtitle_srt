1
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:02,702
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,990
You do it.

3
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:28,896
May I ask you the reason as to why
you trust me this much, sir?

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:33,166
I'm someone who's trying to survive,

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:37,037
no matter what and you're someone
who tries to save people, no matter what.

6
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:41,909
All doctors try their best to save
patients, Mr Chairman.

7
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,911
Do you think they'd really do that if...

8
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,682
...they were receiving billions of
dollars not to?

9
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,384
Pardon?

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,254
So, who's the doctor in charge of him?
Is he good?

11
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,115
I'm not sure if you remember him
but he once went by the name...

12
00:00:57,206 --> 00:01:01,895
...Bu Yong-joo and worked
at Geosan University Hospital.

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,897
Bu Yong-joo...

14
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,168
Are you talking about that crazy man?

15
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,670
That's correct.

16
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,438
That's him...

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,218
An era of subordination.

18
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,277
A world that deems the worth of
someone not based on his or her...

19
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:22,015
...ability or character but instead judges
them based on their usefulness.

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,551
Answer our questions, Dr Bu Yong-joo.

21
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,423
Have you ever had your younger colleagues
perform surgery in your stead?

22
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,561
I received a report saying that the two
patients who died on your operating...

23
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,097
...table even before Ms Jang Hyun-joo,
died because of that.

24
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,032
Is that true?

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,435
You're saying I'm the one who told
them to do that?

26
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,352
Did you just say that those surgeries
happened because I ordered them to?

27
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,179
Why can't you say anything?

28
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:56,483
I asked you if I ever asked anyone to
perform surgery in my stead!

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,987
Be quiet, Dr Bu Yong-joo!
I'll be the one asking the questions!

30
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,788
And the only thing you'll be doing is
answering my questions.

31
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,663
A group of elites who operate
according to the textbook.

32
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,600
This world belongs to the people who
know how to be accepted by that group.

33
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:18,639
To think that the results that you've
had here at Geosan University Hospital...

34
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:25,312
...were all due to the illegal, vile
tactics you used that makes me quite...

35
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,148
...ashamed as chief administrator
of this hospital.

36
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:36,757
I'm sorry to say this, but please
entrust that surgery to someone else.

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,825
This person is a presidential candidate.

38
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,162
Make some time this week and
schedule a surgery for them.

39
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,364
There are patients who have waited...

40
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:49,136
...months for me
to perform surgery on them.

41
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,472
I'll operate on those on
the waiting list first.

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,942
In the order that they arrived.

43
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,919
You were arrogant, and did as
you pleased.

44
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,154
Do you not care about what happens...

45
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:13,026
...to your morals as a doctor as long as
you have money and glory?

46
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,595
You people were the ones who...

47
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,065
...shoved me onto this pedestal in
the first place!

48
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,099
That's because we never knew you...

49
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,569
...were such an immoral and shameless
person.

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,074
Are these all the patients you had
other people operate on in my stead?

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,476
Well, you're just so busy and famous.

52
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,179
It couldn't be helped.

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,948
Most of the people who come here
come seeking you out.

54
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,919
Still, how could you deceive patients
and say I performed surgery on them?

55
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,024
If you're getting worked up because you
think there may be a problem due to this,

56
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,260
don't worry too much.

57
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,964
The hospital will cover
all of this up for you.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,235
You little brat!

59
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,572
Who told you to do this?

60
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,706
Huh?

61
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,941
Who was it?

62
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,912
As we can no longer ignore these
actions of yours...

63
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,349
...we'll send an official document to the
Association of Doctors and Hospitals...

64
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,254
...so that you will never again be able to
find work as a doctor.

65
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,660
That is our final decision.

66
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,763
Loyalty to a certain faction becomes...

67
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,932
...something more trustworthy than
anything else.

68
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,301
And skilled people who adhere to their...

69
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,070
...convictions end up becoming used
ruthlessly by these factions.

70
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,807
Such is the strange place that this
world has now become.

71
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,820
That's fine for today.

72
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,455
Take me back to my hotel.

73
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,023
What about the chairman?

74
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,225
I'll see him tomorrow.

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm sure he's sleeping now, anyway.

76
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,866
EPISODE 15
Rough-Around-the-Edges Syndrome

77
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,138
What a nice morning this is!

78
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,373
Oh, is it, now?

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
That's good for you, then.

80
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,577
You don't feel good?

81
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,681
You, Dr Kang Dong-joo,
seem to be in a great mood.

82
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,016
I wonder why that is?

83
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,086
Well, it's just a great morning, is all!

84
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,156
Hello! Good morning!

85
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,192
Oh, you're here, Dr Yoon?

86
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,861
Yeah. Hi.

87
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,614
Oh man, it's so hot!
Why is it so hot in here?

88
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,748
Isn't it hot?

89
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,916
Maybe the day is warming up already?

90
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,719
It is getting a bit hotter, yes.
And it's so early.

91
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,855
I have to go to the staff room now.

92
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,024
Oh, and I have some business to
take care of in the ER.

93
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,026
Okay, then.

94
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,127
Yes.

95
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,437
Yeah. I'll go that way.

96
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,877
Hot?

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,347
It's 28 degrees Fahrenheit outside!
What are they saying?

98
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,385
-The patient has a stomachache, Doctor.
-Yes.

99
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,588
The patient's name is Hwang Ji-soo,
and he's 45 years old.

100
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,457
He hasn't vomited or had diarrhea.

101
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,592
His stomach just hurts and he feels
a bit chilly.

102
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,828
His vitals are 110/80, with 120 bpm.

103
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,673
And his body temperature is
104 degrees Fahrenheit.

104
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,964
Just a moment.

105
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,201
You even checked if he had
gallstones before?

106
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,737
Yes, I thought it may be that so
I asked him...

107
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,740
...but he said that nothing like that came
up during his last check-up.

108
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,953
You did a good, detailed check over
the patient.

109
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,111
Good job.

110
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,017
So, your stomach hurts a lot, sir?

111
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,285
When did it start hurting?

112
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,089
Stomach pains have come and gone
for about a month now...

113
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,126
...but my stomach
hurt a lot yesterday morning.

114
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,863
And then my entire body started
getting achy.

115
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,397
I also came down with a fever.

116
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,367
I'll be propping your legs up a bit.

117
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,737
I'll be touching your stomach a bit.

118
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,339
Does it hurt when I press down there?

119
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,274
Yes, yes. It hurts.

120
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,076
What about here, then?

121
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,778
Oh! That hurts the most!

122
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,613
Do you drink alcohol often,
by any chance?

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,916
Just... about once or twice a week?

124
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,923
Have you ever had stomach pains or
an upset stomach before this?

125
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,625
Recently, a bit...

126
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,694
I see.

127
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,928
I'll be running some tests on you
first, then.

128
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,599
I suspect there may be some inflammation
so I'll have to take a CT scan, too.

129
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh, Doctor!

130
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,637
Can't you do something so the
pain goes away, first?

131
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,671
Sure, of course.

132
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,107
Give him one dose of tramadol
via IV, please.

133
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,343
Let's also run a pre-operation
blood test with an amylase and...

134
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,011
...lipase test and get an
abdomen CT taken of him.

135
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:31,945
Yes, Doctor.

136
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,348
Oh, I'll go to the CT scan room.

137
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,360
Geez, you surprised me!

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,295
So, did you make it?

139
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,329
Pardon?

140
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,566
I'm talking about the necklace.

141
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,336
Oh... well...

142
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,674
Congratulations, Dr Kang Dong-joo!

143
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,277
See, what did I say?
I told you that she'd bite!

144
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,013
I know this is a bit presumptuous of
me to say but...

145
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,681
...I have a good sense for
those types of things.

146
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,116
Oh, I see.

147
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:12,252
Did you put the necklace on her yourself?

148
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,788
Should I do that?

149
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,190
Oh my goodness!

150
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,723
To think that you're unaware of
something so basic.

151
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,861
What do you mean?

152
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:27,201
Do you know why men use all their
hard-earned money on women's gifts?

153
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,904
It's inherently because of
a man's desires!

154
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,708
Men buy women rings so that
they can hold her hand.

155
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,812
And they buy women necklaces so
they can hold her once.

156
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,616
Like this.

157
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,551
Oh, is that right?

158
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:49,056
So, did Dr Yoon have that
necklace on today?

159
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,028
Well, I didn't check, but...

160
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,563
Geez...!

161
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,602
If she didn't wear the necklace, it
must be due to one of two things.

162
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,337
She doesn't like the necklace or...

163
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,106
...she doesn't like the person who
gave it to her.

164
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,675
I don't think that's necessarily
the case.

165
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,743
Come, now.

166
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,078
Don't lower your guard!

167
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,045
Dr Kang.

168
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,615
Could you please check on the
patient in bed number three?

169
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,517
Yes, sure.

170
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,056
What are you doing, Section Chief Jang?

171
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,292
It's none of your concern.

172
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,428
I was jealous so I'm messing with
him just a little.

173
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,730
Oh, you were jealous, right?

174
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,231
Why?

175
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,235
Because I failed, but he made it!

176
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,904
Goodbye, then...

177
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,548
Yes, what is it?

178
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,318
Are you wearing the necklace I gave you?

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,821
Why are you asking me that
all of the sudden?

180
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,929
So you aren't wearing it today?

181
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,470
I'm busy right now.
I have to go to my morning round.

182
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,230
I just want you to tell me if
you are wearing it or not.

183
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,200
Look here, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

184
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,635
We're at work right now.

185
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,636
Don't try to mix business with
pleasure, okay?

186
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,272
Bye.

187
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,540
Dr Yoon!

188
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,646
What is this? Did she really not wear it?

189
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,285
Hello, Mr Chairman! Good morning...

190
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,290
Isn't it?

191
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,797
His daughter?

192
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,701
Yes, the chairman's daughter
has just arrived.

193
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,337
You may know her, too.

194
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,207
She was once Team Leader of the...

195
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,921
...Strategy Planning Department at
the main hospital.

196
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,748
Stop being stubborn and just get
discharged already, Father!

197
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,184
What kind of nonsense is that?

198
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,186
You want a sick person who was...

199
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,721
...admitted to the hospital to be
discharged now?

200
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,990
If you're going to go to a hospital,
go to a proper one.

201
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,992
Go to a hospital that has proper doctors!

202
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,326
Why are you even here?

203
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,929
You should be raising your kids
in Florida.

204
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,564
You're such a nuisance.

205
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,567
Who even called you here?

206
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,402
Was it Director Do?

207
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,939
It's a heart transplant surgery,
of all things.

208
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,774
How could I just sit still when you're...

209
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,877
...insisting on having such a procedure
done at this lousy hospital?

210
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,631
Furthermore, you're the chairman
of the foundation, Father.

211
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,784
If something goes wrong while the
chairman of the foundation gets...

212
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,654
...an artificial heart transplant surgery
at a no-name hospital like this,

213
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,956
what do you think will happen to
Geosan's reputation?

214
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,928
People will talk about how your sense...

215
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:45,599
...of judgment is clouding over and
say that you've gone senile.

216
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,600
What did you say?

217
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:48,936
Senile?

218
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,939
If you don't want people to say that
about you, come to Seoul with me.

219
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,419
I'll go take care of your
discharging paperwork.

220
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,278
Excuse me.

221
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,747
If you want him discharged,

222
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,083
you'll need the doctor in charge of him to
sign off on the paperwork.

223
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,818
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:09,656
If you want to have him discharged,
you'll need his doctor's permission.

225
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,358
I'm the director of this hospital.

226
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,863
Regardless of your position,
I'm way above you in terms of ranks.

227
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,598
Got that?

228
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,506
Mr Bu Yong-joo?

229
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:32,183
What are you doing here?

230
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,250
What else would a doctor be doing
at a hospital?

231
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,285
I'm taking care of patients, apparently.

232
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,712
You were already stripped of the
right to be a doctor again.

233
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,890
So how dare you walk around,

234
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,025
putting on a doctor act with
a doctor's coat on?

235
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,997
Legally, I never did anything that was
worthy of me losing my medical license.

236
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:54,635
And as for me being kicked out,
that was all a scheme by you people.

237
00:13:55,102 --> 00:14:00,207
So, did you talk the chairman into this
so that you could make a comeback?

238
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,680
I knew that he was an old guy with
a lot of money...

239
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:10,717
...but I had no idea he was the chairman
of the hospital foundation.

240
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,253
And to think that he's your father, too.

241
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,323
This is turning out to be quite
surprising.

242
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,259
I'm going to take father and go to
the main hospital right now.

243
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,964
Did the chairman tell you to do that?

244
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,233
I made this decision as his guardian.

245
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,803
I don't want to entrust my father to
a doctor like you for another second.

246
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,805
A doctor like me?

247
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,577
And what is that, exactly?

248
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,511
What?

249
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,380
You'll have to be more precise since...

250
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:44,985
...I have no idea what the hell you
mean when you put things like that.

251
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,988
Answer me properly.

252
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,224
Just what is a "doctor like me," exactly?

253
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,359
Look here, Mr Bu Yong-joo!

254
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,029
Everyone here calls me Teacher Kim.

255
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,664
"Teacher Kim"?

256
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,869
It seems like you think you can hide
your past by changing your name, but...

257
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,604
I'm not hiding it.

258
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,241
It's more to reflect on my past,
if anything.

259
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,245
It's to reflect on the fact...

260
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:16,583
...that I lived cautiously by the words
of you people...

261
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,554
...and I lived only caring about the
same thing you people did.

262
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,456
It's self-punishment for that fact.

263
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,675
The chairman's daughter?

264
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:42,609
Yes.

265
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:48,682
She says that she's way above all
of us in terms of ranks.

266
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,519
And it seems that she has some
bad blood with Teacher Kim, too.

267
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,923
So I was wondering if you knew
anything about this, Nurse Oh.

268
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,457
I told you.

269
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:01,161
I only met Teacher Kim after he
left the main hospital.

270
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,062
Oh, come on.

271
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,998
You've known him for so long, though!

272
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,935
Are you sure you haven't heard anything?

273
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,037
No, nothing. Never.

274
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,316
What are you doing?

275
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,980
Are you dating Dr Kang, by any chance?

276
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,689
Who... said that?

277
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,715
Is Kang Dong-joo going around
telling people that?

278
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:33,460
No, it was Section Chief Jang's hunch.

279
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,730
He said that you two seemed to
be quite close lately.

280
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,432
Is that true?

281
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:40,929
No.

282
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,670
We're not.

283
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,138
Really.

284
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, I see.

285
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,142
We're really not, Nurse Oh!

286
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,478
Please believe me.
You have to believe me.

287
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,013
Okay.

288
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,520
Kang Dong-joo, that little brat...

289
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,957
-Yeon-hwa.
-Yes?

290
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,125
Where's Kang Dong-joo?

291
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,927
He's in the hybrid room.

292
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,916
What do you think this might be?

293
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:21,375
To me, it looks like the pancreas tail.

294
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,677
Right?
It looks like that to you too, right?

295
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,379
I don't think it's the pancreas.

296
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,648
Oh, you don't?

297
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:32,619
It is an abscess, but it seems to be
originating from the bowel.

298
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,021
The bowel, huh?

299
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,656
Does it look that way to you?

300
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,424
Should I call Teacher Kim?

301
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,161
Hey, Dr Kang Dong-joo!

302
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,931
Why would you call him when I'm here?

303
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,435
I mean, isn't it better to have more
input when the scan is ambiguous?

304
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,905
You know, you've been
acting up quite a bit.

305
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,342
You think it's okay to act like that
just because Teacher Kim loves you?

306
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,078
He's never shown any real
affection for me.

307
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,647
Take a good look if you have eyes!

308
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,583
How is the pancreas?
It's obviously the bowel!

309
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,984
But this part is connected here...

310
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:08,222
Are you trying to educate the Chief
of the Surgical Department?

311
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,157
I'm just telling you what I think.

312
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:11,925
It may look like the bowel, but if...

313
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,104
That's why we're saying it
originated from the bowel, obviously!

314
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,263
How could it be the pancreas tail?

315
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,532
Isn't that right, Dr Do In-bum?

316
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,634
Yes, it seems that way to me, too.

317
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,402
-Chief.
-Doctor.

318
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,705
The patient's BP is falling.
It's 80/40 right now.

319
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:30,110
Please prepare a C-line and
a 500-cc full drip.

320
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,212
Mix 30 milliliters of norepinephrine
and give him 10 cc of it.

321
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,680
And prepare a Foley too, please.

322
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:34,848
Forget it!

323
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,750
Don't try to do anything. Move over.

324
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,188
Prepare a C-line and give him
a 500-cc drip.

325
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:42,422
And what else was there?

326
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,158
Mix 30 mL of norepinephrine,
and give him 10 cc of it.

327
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,345
Prepare a Foley too, please.

328
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,396
Dr Do In-bum will be
in charge of this patient.

329
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,533
He's my patient, Chief!

330
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,136
I can't entrust a patient to a doctor
who can't even analyze a CT properly.

331
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,344
Get the C-line first and move
the patient to the OR.

332
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,440
Yes, sir.

333
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:08,954
I'll give him an antibiotic while
you do the C-line.

334
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,123
Sure.

335
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,557
It seems that Dr Kang Dong-joo
is quite angry.

336
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:17,891
It does seem that way, right?

337
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,298
-Oh, Dr Woo Yeon-hwa.
-Yes, Doctor?

338
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,866
Have you ever assisted in
a surgery before?

339
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,334
Yes. I have.

340
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,302
Good.

341
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,137
You assist me today, then.

342
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,206
See you in the OR in 10 minutes.

343
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,358
This looks like it's near the pancreas,
no matter how I look at it.

344
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,391
Can't you knock, Dr Yoon?

345
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,297
What happened with Chief Song?

346
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:58,732
Why did you two fight?

347
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,735
Well, we had different opinions.

348
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,906
But you know, Kang Dong-joo...

349
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,843
Did you say something weird to
Section Chief Jang, by any chance?

350
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:11,912
What do you mean?

351
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,083
Did you say that we were dating,
or anything similar to that?

352
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:23,357
Well I never said that in
those words though...

353
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,627
I wonder why Nurse Oh asked
me such a thing, then.

354
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,329
What did she ask you?

355
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,636
She asked me if the two of us were
dating out of nowhere.

356
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,735
Are you sure you're not the one who
made her think that?

357
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,869
I wasn't!

358
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,172
I'm really good at keeping those
kinds of things quiet!

359
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:46,914
Why didn't you wear the
necklace I gave you?

360
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,416
Why do you keep asking me that?

361
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:54,555
Well, I wanted to know for sure if
we officially started dating yesterday.

362
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,858
This is why I can't start
anything with you!

363
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,759
What?

364
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,961
Are you saying that we haven't
even started anything yet, then?

365
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,163
What about what we did yesterday, then?

366
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,967
Did we do something yesterday?

367
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,235
You mean you don't remember?

368
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,338
Wow, this won't do!

369
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:12,439
Looks like you need a refresher!

370
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:13,907
-See, see?
-What, what?

371
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:14,808
What did I do?

372
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,045
You keep making it so obvious,
so how can I start anything with you?

373
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,513
Making it so obvious?

374
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,414
Me?

375
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,415
No way!

376
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,584
I have a total poker face!

377
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,385
Haven't you ever heard of a poker face?

378
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,653
"Poker face"? Whatever...

379
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,455
It's written all over your face!

380
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:29,823
Why don't you just go ahead,

381
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,892
and tell everyone at Doldam
while you're at it?

382
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,026
Can I do that?

383
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,299
Promise me something.

384
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,206
What?

385
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,470
You will be nothing but professional
to me at the hospital.

386
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,939
I'm Dr Yoon Seo-Jung,
just like I was before,

387
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,041
and you're just Dr Kang Dong-joo.

388
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:52,813
No personal displays of affection,
just like it has been up until now.

389
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,916
We'll just treat each other as we
did before, as coworkers.

390
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,351
Let's only do that, okay?

391
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,219
Okay.

392
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,491
If I promise you that,
can we start dating today?

393
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,261
Well, it depends on you.

394
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,428
What?

395
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,665
When are we actually going to
become official, then?

396
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,766
It depends on you.

397
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,673
Back to work!

398
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:15,702
I love you.

399
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,611
Do you have a death wish?

400
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:25,946
See?

401
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,981
You need to maintain a poker face!

402
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,384
Everyone at Doldam will find out
about us, at this rate!

403
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,952
Don't do that, okay?

404
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,120
Don't do what?

405
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:34,688
Oh. Saying "I love you"?

406
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,789
Seriously!

407
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,658
You don't want me to say "I love you"?

408
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,592
Stop it.

409
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:39,593
All right.

410
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,028
-I won't say "I love you."
-Stop it!

411
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,262
Okay, okay!

412
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,065
I'll never say "I love you" again!

413
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,965
I love you. Wo ai Ni.

414
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:50,882
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

415
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:51,878
Je t'aime.

416
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,170
Aishiteru.

417
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:55,976
I love you.

418
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,113
Stop.

419
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,684
What is it that you're after?

420
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,486
Is it to come back to
Geosan University Hospital?

421
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,758
Isn't there anything you're curious
about regarding the chairman?

422
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,860
It's too bad for you,

423
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,529
but the main hospital is fully under
Do Yoon-wan's control now.

424
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,233
And I'm sure that 99 percent of the
directors will vote him in again.

425
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,803
So there's not much for you there,
even if you were to go back.

426
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,175
The chairman's condition is
worse than we'd thought.

427
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:34,214
It seems that you're looking to succeed in
this transplant surgery no matter what,

428
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,618
and to have your life take
a dramatic turn, but...

429
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,932
You know how to analyze CT scans
at least, don't you?

430
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,463
You graduated from the main hospital too,
if I'm not mistaken.

431
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,727
Whose CT scan is that?

432
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:48,962
The chairman's.

433
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,334
As you can see,

434
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,637
it's terminal stage lung cancer.

435
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,575
Lung cancer?

436
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:06,980
Yes, according to the CT scans.

437
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,160
So treatment is impossible, then.

438
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,729
There are many different types of
lung cancer, Mr Chairman.

439
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:28,969
First, we'll do a biopsy to figure out
what kind of cancer it is,

440
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,238
and then find a way to treat it.

441
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:46,086
How much time will I have
if I don't receive treatment?

442
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:52,426
Less than three months, Mr Chairman.

443
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:57,931
And that's not factoring in
the issue with my heart?

444
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,034
Correct.

445
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:13,180
So, what do you want to do, here?

446
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,816
There isn't much that a doctor can do.

447
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,820
And there is only so much that
I can prescribe for him.

448
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,504
Ms Yeon-hwa!

449
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,207
Are you going into surgery?

450
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:41,241
Yes.

451
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,844
-For the patient with the abscess?
-Yes.

452
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:47,948
Dr Do In-bum asked me to assist him.

453
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,784
Oh, I see.

454
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:55,489
Would you...

455
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,127
Why are you here?

456
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:01,595
Huh?

457
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:02,982
I came here to be your assistant.

458
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,132
Why? I asked Yeon-hwa to do it.

459
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:10,037
Well, something came up.
So I came in her stead.

460
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,193
That's okay with you, right?

461
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:26,520
So how are we going to do the surgery?

462
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,922
It's a peritoneal abscess that seems
to have originated from the bowel.

463
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,549
So we're going to do a bowel resection.

464
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:31,531
Okay.

465
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,194
We'll get started now, then.

466
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,101
Scalpel.

467
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,705
Doctor.

468
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,639
Yeah?

469
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:49,142
Dr Kang Dong-joo wanted me
to give this to you.

470
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,247
Please look over patient
Hwang Ji-soo's CT scan.

471
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:55,148
And where is Dr Kang now?

472
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,255
He's in the OR where Mr Hwang is
being operated on.

473
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:01,788
It's an abscess from the bowel,
and Dr Do is the head surgeon.

474
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:06,193
But Dr Kang thinks that it may have
originated from the pancreas tail.

475
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:12,199
Hwang Ji-soo.

476
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:20,974
Huh?

477
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,052
As for it originating in the bowel...

478
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,188
His bowels look fine to me.

479
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,560
I'll check his pancreas.

480
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,095
I'll perform an omentectomy. Gauze.

481
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:46,333
Gouge.

482
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:54,975
Retractor.

483
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,853
It is indeed the pancreas tail.

484
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:13,193
Really, Honey?

485
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,598
I'll call you back later.

486
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:19,676
What is it?

487
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:24,004
Hey, I heard that Mr Hwang is in surgery
for a bowel-originated abscess.

488
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,939
Oh, about that. Dr Do In-bum...

489
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,842
Kang Dong-joo had a different opinion.
Why did you ignore him?

490
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,010
Did I?

491
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:32,813
I don't really remember.

492
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,149
I heard that you were there and saw
that CT scan with your own eyes!

493
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,385
You saw it,
and yet you didn't even have...

494
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:40,454
...a slight suspicion that it may
have been from the pancreas tail?

495
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:44,057
I mean, at first, I thought that may
have been it.

496
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:48,295
But Dr Do In-bum seemed to be
so sure that it was from the bowel.

497
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:53,300
You should've examined the scan carefully
if two fellows' opinions were different!

498
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,369
Aren't you supposed to be the chief?

499
00:28:56,136 --> 00:29:00,240
Yet, all you did was split the two apart?

500
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,343
Why are you acting like this?

501
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:06,213
I know how to analyze CT scans, you know!

502
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:10,350
Do In-bum and I had the same opinion
so we made that decision!

503
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,886
Aren't you looking down on me too much?

504
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,157
DO IN-BUM

505
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,194
Yeah, Dr Do In-bum?

506
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:21,567
What is it?

507
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,166
After opening him up, it seems that
it didn't originate from the bowel.

508
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:27,707
Really?

509
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,342
If not the bowel, where was it from?

510
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:33,040
The pancreas tail.

511
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,144
Oh, I see.

512
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,213
Well, these things happen.

513
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,816
In surgery, things can turn out
differently...

514
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,651
...than what you expected it to be.

515
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,888
Don't panic.

516
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,591
Going with the flow is all part of
a surgeon's skill, too.

517
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,160
So, what should I do now?

518
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:58,131
Have you ever done
a distal pancreatectomy before?

519
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,070
Yes, once.

520
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:04,923
And I've assisted multiple times, too.

521
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,209
You've done it before?

522
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,777
That's great.

523
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,532
Use this chance
to brush up on your skills, then.

524
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:18,085
And I'll come in anytime if there are
any complications, so don't worry.

525
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,987
All right.

526
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:26,460
They said it was the pancreas.

527
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,795
Oh geez.

528
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,235
Is that true?

529
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:40,240
Have you really done a distal
pancreatectomy before?

530
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,575
Why?

531
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,177
Do you think I'd lie about that?

532
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,683
You lied last time when we had
the Boerhaave syndrome patient.

533
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:53,453
I'll begin the distal pancreatectomy now.

534
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:55,622
I'll start with a dissection.

535
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,529
Forceps.

536
00:30:58,992 --> 00:30:59,832
Gouge.

537
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,018
Could you call Chief Song again?

538
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:25,925
Sure.

539
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:35,762
What are you doing?

540
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:36,897
Aren't you picking up?

541
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,633
Oh, it's an unknown number.

542
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,801
I'll pick up later.

543
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:43,343
DO IN-BUM

544
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,343
What's going on?

545
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,515
Hurry up and tell me what's going on.

546
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:59,820
Dr Do In-bum is doing
a distal pancreatectomy right now.

547
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:00,787
So?

548
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,425
You tell him what the problem is.

549
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:12,132
I wanted to know if you're
supposed to take the spleen out too...

550
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:15,669
...when doing a distal pancreatectomy.

551
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,205
He said he called to ask you.

552
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,239
Hurry up and tell him.

553
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,275
Yes, of course.

554
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:22,176
You're supposed to take them out together.

555
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,278
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

556
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,613
I can't seem to sever
the splenic artery easily.

557
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:30,017
And it seems that it might implode
if I do something incorrectly.

558
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,886
Oh, I see.

559
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:34,221
Geez...

560
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,155
What to do?

561
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,090
What do you mean, "What to do?"

562
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,092
You'll have to crawl into the OR.

563
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,093
Who?

564
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:41,828
Me?

565
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,831
Should I be the one
to crawl in there, then?

566
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,303
All right.

567
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:51,205
Just wait, Dr Do In-bum.

568
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:53,340
I'll head in there now.

569
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,175
Thank you.

570
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,885
How pathetic...

571
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,528
Have you heard of
"spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?"

572
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:15,929
Yes, I've heard of it.

573
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:17,783
But I have no experience with it.

574
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:20,696
If that's the case,
consider this an honor.

575
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,603
Take a good look at what I do.

576
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:23,954
Forceps!

577
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:25,672
Gouge.

578
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,710
Due to its location,

579
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:33,480
the spleen is usually removed
during this procedure.

580
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:37,651
But there have been reports of patients'
immune systems suffering with the spleen.

581
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:39,620
So it's best to just leave it alone
when there aren't...

582
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,089
...any large intestine complications.

583
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,791
I heard it's been quite some time
since you were last in an OR,

584
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:45,993
but you seem to know your way around.

585
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,060
Of course.

586
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:50,007
I am the Chief of the Surgical Department
at the main hospital after all.

587
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:53,233
All right, I'm finishing things up here.

588
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,735
Do this, and then...

589
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:58,172
When it's split, like this...

590
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,376
Good.

591
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:03,644
How's that?

592
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:05,212
Nice and clean, right?

593
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,285
Yes.

594
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:14,655
What? What is going on?

595
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:16,791
I believe the artery has been damaged.

596
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,050
Darn it. Gauze!

597
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,897
Clamp!

598
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,465
Can you see where the bleeding
is coming from?

599
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:26,834
I can't get a good look.

600
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,572
Forceps!

601
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:35,313
Hey, suction. One more!

602
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:38,979
Irrigation.

603
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,483
Suction!

604
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,522
Hey, that's enough. That's enough!

605
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,562
Wow, this won't do.

606
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:58,532
I think we'll have to cut
the spleen off, after all.

607
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,741
Sutures, please.

608
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:08,709
Wait.

609
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,612
What do you mean, wait?

610
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,087
Huh? What are you doing?

611
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,221
Move aside!

612
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:27,327
There's a slight tear at
the splenic artery.

613
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:32,232
I think we'll be able to save
the spleen if we just stitch this up.

614
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:37,738
May I do it?

615
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,707
What are you doing?

616
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:42,976
This is my surgery.
Why are you trying to educate me, huh?

617
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,179
If you're confident, then you do it!

618
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,780
I thought you said you'd done it before.

619
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:53,754
If this goes wrong, it'll all be your
responsibility, Kang Dong-joo.

620
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,355
Will you still do it?

621
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,958
Wow, you're the same as ever, aren't you?

622
00:35:58,892 --> 00:35:59,860
You're here looking for someone...

623
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:02,062
...to blame
as soon as something goes wrong.

624
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:03,664
Stop saying unnecessary things!

625
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,265
Are you going to do it or not?

626
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,048
Loupe, please.

627
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,051
Okay.

628
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:31,692
Number five sutures.

629
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,160
Dr Kang.

630
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,295
Please give it to me.

631
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,776
Focus.

632
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:11,999
Cut.

633
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,180
Okay.

634
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:08,922
Cut.

635
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,831
All right, we'll undo this now.

636
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,568
Irrigation.

637
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,276
There's no bleeding.

638
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,279
I think the spleen will be fine.

639
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,949
Shall I finish things up here?

640
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:57,271
Hey, Do In-bum!

641
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:02,409
How many more times are you going to lie
to get in front of an operating table?

642
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:03,610
What are you talking about?

643
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,179
You did it today, too.

644
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,448
You've never done
a distal pancreatectomy before!

645
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,418
So isn't it only normal that you
and I switch spots?

646
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:12,686
That was my surgery.

647
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,856
I thought I could handle it.

648
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,859
And I've done tons of simulations
with online videos.

649
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:22,896
Hey, a video simulation and
a real surgery aren't the same thing!

650
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:25,432
That's how I always practice.

651
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,336
How else would I gain experience
from all those different cases?

652
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:31,038
You're an irresponsible little brat.

653
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:35,008
A true surgeon needs to know how
to gain experience in all kinds of ways!

654
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:40,714
Nobody knows what'll happen once
a patient is cut open, anyway.

655
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:46,153
So, you're going to continue getting
experience by lying?

656
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,156
Stop acting all high and mighty just
because you happened to save a spleen.

657
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:53,126
I hope that you never hold a scalpel
in your hand using that sort of method.

658
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:57,397
If you do that, I'll cut you open myself.

659
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,335
Coward.

660
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,703
Hey.

661
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:03,804
Hey!

662
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,242
You little brat!

663
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,823
Let go! Let go!

664
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,125
Ow! Let go!

665
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:32,633
Bring your dad here, you punk!

666
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,608
Mr Go!

667
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,202
Let go, Darn it!

668
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,106
Let go!

669
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,707
Let go!

670
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:41,842
Hey!

671
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,016
Stop it already.

672
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,820
Let go!

673
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:58,892
What?

674
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,594
The two of them fought again?

675
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,898
Dr Dong-joo was pretty cool
back there, in the OR.

676
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,701
And thanks to him, Dr Do In-bum
ended up looking a bit pathetic.

677
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:12,439
Kang Dong-joo was cool? How so, exactly?

678
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,308
He was stitching up an artery,

679
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:17,377
and wow, I thought I was watching
Teacher Kim.

680
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:20,180
The way he did it was so similar to
how Teacher Kim does it.

681
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,182
"All right. Concentrate."

682
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,087
"Cut."

683
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,426
So he was acting like Teacher Kim
in there?

684
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,962
No, it wasn't just an act.
He really did well.

685
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:38,498
His technique wasn't as refined
as Teacher Kim's, but it was similar.

686
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,000
What?

687
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,970
He's always complaining about how
Teacher Kim acts all high and mighty.

688
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:45,138
Well, you know.
He may say that, but he's learning.

689
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,608
People grow fond of each other
after hating one another.

690
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:48,976
So?

691
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,802
Where are the two guys who were
fighting now?

692
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:57,651
What is it this time?

693
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,620
Why did you two fight this time?

694
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,477
You're not going to tell me?

695
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,564
He interrupted my surgery and took charge,
so I got mad.

696
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,036
I'll be careful so this doesn't
happen again.

697
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,536
What about you, Kang Dong-joo?

698
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,111
You don't have anything to say?

699
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,442
No, I don't.

700
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,444
All right.

701
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,815
The one who has nothing to say
can go ahead and leave.

702
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:44,698
I heard you two got into a tussle again.

703
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,967
I heard it was a real spectacle,
a dog fight.

704
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,903
Well, he hit me first.
Was I supposed to just take it?

705
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,705
What's wrong with you two?

706
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:55,132
It would be so nice if you could just
get along, since you're the same age.

707
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,845
And both of you have terrible,
stubborn personalities,

708
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,346
so you don't have any friends as it is.

709
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,981
What are you talking about?
I have tons of friends.

710
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,049
What's with you?

711
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:07,955
Sure, that's why none of your friends
have visited since you started here.

712
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,592
Well, that's because they're busy
working and such.

713
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:14,995
And you don't have
any friends either, Dr Yoon!

714
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,142
What are you talking about?

715
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:20,133
Nurse Uhm, Jung... Nurse Park.

716
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,506
And sometimes, I drink beer with
Nurse Oh and Dr Nam Do-il, too.

717
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:26,740
So they're my friends.

718
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:29,009
Oh, so the people around you are
automatically your friends?

719
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:29,943
Sure!

720
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,546
Then the trees behind
the hospital are your friends,

721
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:35,093
and the birds singing in
the trees are your friends too, right?

722
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:37,384
I'll be going now.

723
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,420
Come on, you can't just go.

724
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,789
Didn't you come because you
were worried about me?

725
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:53,100
Make sure you put some ointment
on that wound.

726
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,166
I'll really be going now.

727
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:56,603
I love you.

728
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,606
I told you not to say that!

729
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:01,475
You're really...

730
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,215
That's enough!

731
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:10,517
You should get going now, Dr Yoon!

732
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:22,469
At any rate, you two are grown adults!
Stop hitting each other already!

733
00:44:22,664 --> 00:44:25,700
I told you, Do In-bum punched me first!

734
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:28,202
Well, you must've done something
to piss him off a lot!

735
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:33,207
I know him, and he's not the type to
just go around punching people!

736
00:44:33,273 --> 00:44:36,376
He's someone who never lets his
own hands get dirty!

737
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:39,423
Are you seriously taking his side
right now?

738
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:40,647
That's enough.

739
00:44:41,227 --> 00:44:43,129
Watch yourself from now on, okay?

740
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:46,353
This is a hospital,
not an Aikido learning center.

741
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:00,934
Those two really need to work
on their acting.

742
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:03,904
What is it? Go ahead.

743
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,574
Why do you keep getting mad like this?

744
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:08,575
Me, sir?

745
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:11,211
I've never done that.

746
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:17,184
Kang Dong-joo and I were never
on good terms from the start.

747
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:20,087
And on top of that,
he intercepted my surgery.

748
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:22,289
So I got mad.

749
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:28,829
So you won't tell me the truth
until the end, eh?

750
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:37,137
Or is it that you don't know
how to be honest?

751
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,239
Pardon?

752
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,108
Forget it. Leave.

753
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,812
About Chairman Shin's surgery...

754
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,918
We may not be able to do it.

755
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,754
Chairman Shin has terminal lung cancer.

756
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,825
Go and tell your father that.

757
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:03,330
What do you mean by that?

758
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,933
That's why you're here, isn't it?

759
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:09,903
And that's why you asked to join
my surgical team, right?

760
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:17,845
You know...

761
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:22,149
...I prefer jagged rocks over round,
insignificant ones.

762
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,918
What I'm saying is...

763
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:29,556
...it's better to have your own style
and your own thoughts.

764
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:39,533
That way, when you find yourself
struggling with the world,

765
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,603
you'll find yourself
and your own place there.

766
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:47,841
Not being passive and
just floating by in life,

767
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:49,510
but with edge.

768
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:55,382
You'll have your own philosophies
and principles, and find yourself.

769
00:46:57,851 --> 00:47:02,856
I once thought you were
that kind of a person.

770
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:06,894
You did that empyema surgery that day
when you didn't even need to.

771
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,098
You didn't do it because you believed that
your dad would have your back,

772
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,434
but you did it for the patient's survival.

773
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:17,171
Also, your skills weren't too bad, either.

774
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:22,376
That's why I kept you here, but...

775
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:25,412
But what?

776
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:31,685
I think I misjudged you, after all.

777
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:36,957
Go and report that to your father.

778
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:40,727
Chairman Shin's surgery is ruined now,

779
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:44,731
so he won't need to try so hard anymore.

780
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:52,406
And it'd be best for you to leave
Doldam now, too.

781
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:23,003
Terminal lung cancer?

782
00:48:24,505 --> 00:48:26,039
So he's in the terminal stage of
lung cancer, eh?

783
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:27,140
Yes, Father.

784
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,108
That's how it is.

785
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,511
What about the surgery, then?

786
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,113
What's going to happen with the
artificial heart transplant surgery?

787
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,916
I think it'll be difficult for them to
do it now.

788
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:37,303
Did Bu Yong-joo say that himself?

789
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,687
Did those words come out of his own lips?

790
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,556
Are you sure he said that?

791
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:43,490
Yes.

792
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,592
He said that to me himself.

793
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:47,294
All right.

794
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:48,601
Got it.

795
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:50,864
Father...

796
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:53,567
What?

797
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:54,501
Go ahead.

798
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:59,306
I can come back now, right?

799
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,179
Stay there until the situation
becomes more certain.

800
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,147
And quit your whining.

801
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:26,934
Yes?

802
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:32,039
I'm here, Director.

803
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,247
I rushed here as soon as I heard
the news about Chairman Shin.

804
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:38,712
You must be quite concerned.

805
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,014
Who told you about that?

806
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:45,285
There are a couple of people who are
my eyes and ears at Doldam.

807
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,354
I see.

808
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:51,525
I'm a bit hesitant to say this but in
this situation, it would be best to...

809
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:55,229
...give up on the artificial heart
transplant surgery, wouldn't it?

810
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,138
So, what do you think?

811
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:12,212
Do you think that I should get
the surgery?

812
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,716
Or do you think I should just
give it up...

813
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,422
...since I'm going to die soon anyway?

814
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:30,497
To be honest,
in a situation such as this,

815
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:36,670
the doctor cannot do anything
except respect the choice of the patient.

816
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:43,343
If I said that I wouldn't get the surgery,

817
00:50:45,646 --> 00:50:46,914
what would happen then?

818
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:56,983
I was planning to fix your heart up
and make a huge name for myself.

819
00:50:58,192 --> 00:51:00,928
So first and foremost,
I'd have to give up on that plan.

820
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,629
Geez...

821
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:08,368
How can you make jokes like that
in this sort of situation?

822
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:12,739
There's no way for me to know...

823
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:19,446
...whether your heart or lungs
will be the first to fail.

824
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:28,121
And what if I say
that I still want the surgery?

825
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:37,064
Artificial heart transplant surgery
is quite a dangerous procedure.

826
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,170
So either way, I'm doomed.

827
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,544
All right.

828
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,249
Oh, Director Yeo!

829
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:57,284
Oh! Hello.

830
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,088
Oh, you were here too, Section Chief?

831
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:05,659
Would you like a cup of coffee as well,
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

832
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:07,561
Yes, thank you.

833
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:10,364
About Dr Kang Dong-joo.

834
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,890
He may be a bit cranky on the outside,

835
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:16,351
but he's quite a considerate man.

836
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,604
Isn't that right, Director Yeo?

837
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:18,839
Yes, well...

838
00:52:18,906 --> 00:52:20,474
He does seem to be like that.

839
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:26,280
He does have some stern looking,
arched eyebrows, though.

840
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:31,552
But I'm sure they'll relax a bit
once he finds a woman he likes.

841
00:52:31,618 --> 00:52:32,853
Isn't that right, Director Yeo?

842
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,823
Well, I don't know about
physiognomy, so...

843
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:41,995
He is definitely a good boyfriend
and husband material.

844
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,772
Thank you for the coffee, Section Chief.

845
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:53,173
I'll get going now, then.

846
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,242
Of course. Bye.

847
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:59,446
She really is bad at managing
her facial expressions.

848
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:01,582
Hey, Kang Dong-joo! It's an emergency!

849
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:02,916
An emergency?

850
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:05,986
I think that Section Chief Jang noticed
something about us.

851
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:07,754
-What do you mean?
-Oh my goodness...

852
00:53:09,957 --> 00:53:12,426
I think he's having suspicions about us.

853
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:16,096
He's even saying ridiculous things
in front of Director Yeo now.

854
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:20,934
At this rate, he's going to spread
some weird rumors all over the hospital!

855
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:23,609
So?

856
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:27,894
Let's get into a fight.

857
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:29,943
A fight?

858
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:30,911
Yeah.

859
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,479
A huge one, too.

860
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:33,847
Let's make it look realistic.

861
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:39,520
Dr Yoon Seo-Jung, how could you
give patient painkillers first?

862
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:41,054
Dong-joo, that's because I...

863
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:43,290
Can't you see the patient's in pain?

864
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:44,358
He was in so much pain...

865
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:45,792
I wasn't even that far away!

866
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,695
I could've run here from my office
in two minutes flat.

867
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:50,130
You should've called me first!

868
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:52,566
You should've waited to see
if he needed surgical intervention!

869
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:54,468
That's true... I thought that too, but...

870
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:58,739
Don't you know that nothing besides
NSAIDs affect physical exam results?

871
00:53:58,805 --> 00:53:59,840
I did. I did, but...

872
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,709
From now on, call the surgeon before
treating abdominal pain patients!

873
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:05,145
Do you think this is a traffic
control room or something?

874
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:09,216
All the doctors here are board-certified
and can take care of these things!

875
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:12,019
Are you ER people trying to fight
with the Surgical Department?

876
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,420
Hey!

877
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:14,688
Are you going to be disrespectful
toward your senior?

878
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,356
What's wrong with you two?

879
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,791
I'm the one who made the mistake!
It was me!

880
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:20,460
You didn't do anything wrong.

881
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:25,432
All Kang Dong-joo and Yoon Seo-Jung
ever do is fight when they meet.

882
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,267
Right.

883
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,257
-It's all fake.
-Geez, you surprised me.

884
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,338
Fake? What do you mean?

885
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:34,641
They're trying to hide the fact
that they're dating.

886
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,744
A cover-up, if you want.

887
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:38,979
Oh, no way.

888
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,648
You're overthinking it. It's not.

889
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,328
What are you going to do
if I'm right about this?

890
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:47,187
You can drink for free
at my restaurant for a month.

891
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,189
With free snacks, too.

892
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:51,859
Sure, why not.

893
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:56,330
Why are you two betting when those two
are the ones who may be dating?

894
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:58,984
-Because it's fun.
-Because it's fun.

895
00:55:03,337 --> 00:55:04,271
It's Teacher Kim.

896
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:05,973
Your answer makes no sense!

897
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,013
All right. Everyone, please take a seat.

898
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,050
What's going on, Teacher Kim?

899
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:18,619
Starting today...

900
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:25,792
...we'll put a halt to
the surgery conferences.

901
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:35,035
What do you mean, Doctor?

902
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:37,337
The results of the CT scan came out.

903
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,174
The chairman has terminal lung cancer.

904
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:46,311
So, he's in the terminal stage of
lung cancer.

905
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:48,749
In this situation,

906
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:54,388
doing an artificial heart transplant would
be too much on the patient, I believe.

907
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:58,959
So, what we did up until now...

908
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,001
May we come in for a bit?

909
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,047
It's fine. Sit, all of you.

910
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,958
Are these the staff members who
will be doing my surgery?

911
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,160
Yes, Mr Chairman.

912
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:37,264
They seem quite trustworthy.

913
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,300
Don't you think so, Manager Joo?

914
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,436
Yes, I do.

915
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:50,444
I was actually discussing
your surgery with these folks just now.

916
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,179
Oh, good.

917
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,519
I actually came down here
to talk about that.

918
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,794
Look here, Teacher Kim.

919
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:08,801
Yes?

920
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:15,135
Let's proceed as we'd originally planned.

921
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:17,471
Pardon?

922
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:26,980
Let's do the surgery
as we'd originally planned.

923
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,650
But, Mr Chairman...

924
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:35,728
Since things have come to this,

925
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,624
how about we promote you
from Director to Chairwoman?

926
00:57:45,265 --> 00:57:47,467
We at the main hospital believe...

927
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:50,037
...we need a chairman
who is familiar with our work.

928
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:59,112
You can call this greed
or a result of senility.

929
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,415
But...

930
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:09,122
I want to live every day of my life
without a heavy heart.

931
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:15,495
I'll die anyway, so you can grant me
at least that, right?

932
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,501
Right, Teacher Kim?

933
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,145
Did Bu Yong-joo say
that he'd do the surgery?

934
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,080
Do you think Director Do
will just leave Teacher Kim alone?

935
00:59:07,147 --> 00:59:09,683
He could end up putting everyone
at Doldam in danger.

936
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,518
I'm going to make two offers
to Bu Yong-joo.

937
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:13,187
What? Replacing the staff?

938
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:14,621
And all of the people
at Geosan University?

939
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:15,522
Bu Yong-joo is...

940
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,424
How do you feel about this turmoil?

941
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,459
He'll never allow his staff
to be replaced.

942
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:23,163
If you can't agree to that,
you must agree to my other condition.

943
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,097
Is that okay with you?

944
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:27,534
I'll make him disappear forever
from this society, and from this world.

945
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,544
You're tired, right?

946
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:42,716
Thank you.

947
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,890
Wow, how pretty.

948
00:59:49,957 --> 00:59:52,626
Is that a gift?

949
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,665
It's just...

950
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:07,281
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim
