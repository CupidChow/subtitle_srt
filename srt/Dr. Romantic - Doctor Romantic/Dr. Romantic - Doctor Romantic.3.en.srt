00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:30,082
EPISODE 3

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,763
The wound is small but deep.

3
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:42,263
So we have to reconnect an artery,
a nerve, and two tendons.

4
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,154
So overall five things.
Have you ever done this before?

5
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:49,950
I asked you if you've done this before.

6
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,286
No.

7
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,330
I've only ever seen the procedure
done in videos.

8
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:55,741
This is the first time for me.

9
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,843
If you make even a single mistake
from here on out,

10
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,939
I'll cut your hand off and stick it
on Dr Yoon.

11
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:02,857
Be aware of that.

12
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,824
Let us begin.

13
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:06,777
Scalpel.

14
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,031
I'll be performing a dissection
for the next five minutes.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,540
I'll finish repairing the nerve,
the artery, and tendon within 30 minutes.

16
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,949
Is that even possible?

17
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:22,720
Hook.

18
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,026
Hold this spot.

19
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,512
Suction tube.

20
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:39,281
Her median nerve partial, radial artery,
FPL, FCR, and PL are completely damaged.

21
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:42,284
He's going to finish working on all this
within half an hour?

22
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,609
The 10,000-hour Rule.

23
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,784
If you work on something for three hours
every day for 10 years,

24
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,541
you can become an expert at it.

25
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,494
It's a rule that definitely seems
to have some credibility.

26
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,811
But...

27
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:00,921
...the time it takes to create
one specialist...

28
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,403
...is 20 hours a day,

29
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,639
for 11 years,
which is 80,300 hours in total.

30
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:10,081
One must study like crazy
for those 80,000 hours...

31
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:13,700
...dedicate oneself to learning everything
about one's field...

32
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,454
...and pass the board exam.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,606
ANd one must really give it all to get
a specialization license in 11 years.

34
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,187
But...

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,420
But I didn't try that hard...

36
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:28,984
...and study my ass off,
practice that much, perform dissections...

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,190
...and pull all those all-nighters...

38
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:35,597
...just to be stuck in this wretched
excuse of a hospital!

39
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,320
The present seemed to be as grim as ever.

40
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:40,960
So, what's your point?

41
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,243
And thus, I was more uncertain
about my future.

42
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,175
I'm going to go back to the main hospital,
no matter what happens.

43
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,608
I'll definitely go back there.
No matter what.

44
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,905
That's what I said, but...

45
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,771
The tourniquet has been in place
for five minutes.

46
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,419
Okay, we'll begin
arterial revascularization.

47
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,604
Put the loupe down.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,424
Give me the surgical string.

49
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:14,998
Give me a Number 8 string.

50
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,046
A Number 8 string is almost too thin
to see with your bare eyes.

51
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:34,913
But to think that such speed
was possible...

52
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,914
Who is this man, really?

53
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,321
Dr Kang?

54
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,020
Cut.

55
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,273
Hey, do you want to have your hand
cut off?

56
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:52,543
Cut!

57
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,475
Cut.

58
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:04,724
Cut.

59
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:08,214
Cut.

60
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,427
20 minutes left, sir.

61
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:14,688
Cut.

62
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:20,144
Okay, I'll be reconstructing
the nerve now.

63
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,485
And then we'll begin the tenorrhaphy.

64
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,801
Focus!

65
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:32,648
Cut.

66
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:35,803
Cut.

67
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,901
Cut.

68
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,845
For the next five minutes,
I'll be performing a tenorrhaphy.

69
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,846
What?
You're going to do it within five minutes?

70
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,809
Begin.

71
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,328
Needle.

72
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,002
Right side. Right side!

73
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:06,085
No, not there. Higher!

74
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,358
Five minutes have elapsed.

75
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,527
Okay.

76
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,445
Two minutes left.

77
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:34,958
Cut.

78
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:42,768
Cut.

79
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,493
He's fast.

80
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,655
Cut.

81
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:49,991
Really fast.

82
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,953
One minute left, sir.

83
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:55,391
Cut.

84
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,159
Suction.

85
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,638
Suction!

86
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,126
Cut.

87
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:22,421
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,260
19 seconds left, sir.

89
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,410
Cut.

90
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:33,498
Cut.

91
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:39,901
The nurse assisting him seems to know
what he'd do next and is ready.

92
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:43,307
She didn't make a single mistake
or unnecessary movement.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,081
Her movements were perfect.

94
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:48,183
-Time's up, sir.
-Cut.

95
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,811
Turn the tourniquet off.

96
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,142
-Any bleeding?
-No, sir.

97
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,881
Her BP is 100/70
and her oxygen levels are stable too.

98
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,339
Okay.

99
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,157
Take care of the rest
and close up the wound.

100
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,375
You can do that much, right?

101
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,811
I'm so pissed off.

102
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:36,747
Good job.

103
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:44,424
But there was nothing that I could say.

104
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:49,862
The surgical procedure he performed
was the most perfect one I'd ever seen...

105
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,418
...and in that moment,
I'd been more stupid than I'd ever been.

106
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,185
I'm fine.

107
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:07,428
I'm okay.

108
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,128
Darn it.

109
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:37,835
Yes?

110
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:41,127
We just finished the surgery on Dr Yoon
and moved her to the ICU.

111
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:42,750
I see.

112
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,818
And about Dr Kang.

113
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,862
He's under a total shock right now.

114
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:51,085
Yes, I'll do that.

115
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:58,927
Seems like Teacher Kim was hard
on someone again.

116
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:03,227
He went about it like he always does.
As usual...

117
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,625
Teacher Kim's usual approach.

118
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:08,010
He'll probably pack his bags and leave,
just like all the other doctors did...

119
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:12,152
...while cursing Teacher Kim
and wishing ill upon him.

120
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,348
I need you to explain something to me.

121
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,598
Who are you really, Doctor?

122
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,295
What kind of nonsense
are you spouting now?

123
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,294
I can't understand it, no matter
how much I think about it.

124
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,430
What do you mean?

125
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,244
A hospital doctor came charging at me
in a casino with a knife...

126
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,107
...and your title
is Chief of the Surgical Department...

127
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,074
...yet you work in the ER most of your time!

128
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:49,330
There's no need for you to interfere
in my work or private life now.

129
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:51,458
The surgery you performed this afternoon
made it clear you were a general surgeon...

130
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,160
...but the angiorrhaphy you performed
just now...

131
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:57,328
...was too good to be the skill
of a mere GS!

132
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,168
You have a problem
because I'm too skilled?

133
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,698
What's your specialty anyway, Doctor?

134
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,085
Are you a casino thug,
or are you an ER specialist?

135
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:05,703
Or are you a surgeon?

136
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,280
I'm sure you've specialized
in performing a type of surgery!

137
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,269
Are you a GS?

138
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:11,529
Or are you an orthopedic surgeon?

139
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,174
Which one is your real specialty?

140
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,983
Saving lives.

141
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,152
That's my specialty, okay?

142
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,555
Stop beating around the bush like that!

143
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,071
I'm asking you a serious question
right now.

144
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:24,862
Are you sure
it's not because you're embarrassed?

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
What do you mean by that, sir?

146
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,145
You humiliated yourself
in the operating room.

147
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,500
And it wasn't just
in the operating room, either.

148
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,032
You call yourself a doctor...

149
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,594
...and yet you were sitting at a casino bar,
in the early evening, getting plastered?

150
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:44,309
And you were about to use a defibrillator
on someone choking on their food.

151
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:47,314
Geez.

152
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:53,533
Just how are university hospitals
educating their doctors nowadays?

153
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,042
Don't underestimate me.

154
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,738
Despite that, I passed the national
board exam with the highest marks.

155
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:03,215
Well, why did you try so hard to pass
with the highest marks in the country?

156
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,212
When in a real operating room...

157
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,879
...you can't even tell when I need suction
for a cut and you hesitate.

158
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:11,966
I didn't hesitate.
It's just that you were abnormally fast!

159
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:17,555
Do you know why they put masks
on surgeons in the operating room?

160
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:20,267
Well, that's so everything remains sterile.

161
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,618
No, it's so you keep your mouth shut.

162
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,638
You're to keep your mouth shut
and let your talent do all the talking.

163
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,265
Don't hesitate and act pathetic
in front of a patient...

164
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:31,358
...who's entrusted their life to you
on the operating table.

165
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,326
Stop giving me reasons and excuses.

166
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,558
Being a surgeon is an active battle!

167
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,786
And you were the one who failed back
in the OR.

168
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,561
You got that?

169
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:46,078
I still haven't heard your answer!

170
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,789
I asked you who you really are.

171
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,308
Why, this little brat...

172
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:16,932
Kim Sa Bu.

173
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,420
What?

174
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,543
That's who I really am.

175
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,231
Dr Teacher Kim.

176
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:27,516
Happy now?

177
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,593
Darn it!

178
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:43,474
Did you hear what Dr Kang Dong-joo just said?

179
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,345
He passed the national board exam
with the highest score.

180
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:49,009
Yes, I did. What about it?

181
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,404
If it is true...

182
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,165
Such strange people.

183
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,070
Such a strange doctor.

184
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,573
Hello. This is the investigation team.

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,163
We've found the car that was a part
of the hit-and-run incident

186
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,476
in Doldam Hospital's parking lot.

187
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:33,620
Such a strange hospital.

188
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:36,432
ICU

189
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:41,873
Why are you in a strange place
like this, Dr Yoon?

190
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:50,424
What have you been doing here
for the past 5 years?

191
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:16,275
FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH

192
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:43,016
No!

193
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,459
What?

194
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:53,822
Seo-Jung is?

195
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,620
You mean, Yoon Seo-Jung, AKA Crazy Whale
who disappeared 5 years ago?

196
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,756
Yes, that very same Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

197
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,905
What a surprise! Oh, my God.
Unbelievable!

198
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,674
What a scoop! So, is she doing well?

199
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,109
Did she get married? Have kids?

200
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,795
What?

201
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,711
She's preparing to be a
double certified doctor? Why?

202
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:16,314
I don't know why she's wasting
so much time doing that, either.

203
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,000
No. She can't really talk right now.

204
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:25,837
But can you look into someone
named Teacher Kim for me?

205
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,236
Teacher what? Teacher Kim?

206
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,814
What is that? Is that a name?

207
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,999
I'm not too sure about the details myself.

208
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,866
Everyone just calls him Teacher Kim.

209
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,706
He's the Chief of the Surgical Department
at Doldam Hospital...

210
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,235
...but can you find out his real name,

211
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,748
what school he attended
and what his specialization is?

212
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,430
Also, can you find out
why he came to Doldam Hospital...

213
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,343
Dr In-soo. It's me, Yoon Seo-Jung.

214
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,813
Seo... Seo-Jung! Seo-Jung!

215
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,559
Hey, Crazy Whale!
You were alive this whole time?

216
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:56,773
Everything Kang Dong-joo is saying
right now is crap.

217
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,147
Just forget what he said.

218
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:00,519
Why couldn't we get in touch
with you, Seo-Jung?

219
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,978
Hey, wait... Hello?

220
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,971
Hey... Crazy Whale!

221
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,804
So you're the same as always, huh?

222
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,847
Who's Crazy Whale?

223
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,549
Oh, it's someone named Yoon Seo-Jung.

224
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:17,177
The one who blocked off a splenic artery
with just her index finger.

225
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,424
"Queen of the Index Finger."

226
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,632
She used to be quite successful here.
You've never heard of her?

227
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:22,631
-I guess she was quite skilled.
-Of course.

228
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,551
She was the best
in our department back then...

229
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:25,788
...but she got into a car accident
and quit working here.

230
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,840
Nobody had heard from her since then.

231
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,505
But she was at Doldam Hospital
this whole time!

232
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,470
Doldam Hospital?

233
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:35,028
You know, the place Kang Dong-joo
was unfairly sent off to this time.

234
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,363
It's in Jungsun...

235
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,456
Well, I'm not saying that it was unfair
of the director to have done so.

236
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,029
He did do something wrong, after all.

237
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,527
Do you know someone
called Teacher Kim, by any chance?

238
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,015
You don't, right?

239
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:52,634
I wonder who'd know about this.
I'll have to go ask Dr Ahn.

240
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:56,650
Doldam Hospital, huh?

241
00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,842
What are you doing here?

242
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,855
I'd like to ask you the same thing.
What are you doing?

243
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:03,860
You're digging into people's pasts
behind their backs.

244
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:06,221
What are you even digging
into Teacher Kim's past for?

245
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,532
What are you planning to do
with that information?

246
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,071
Don't you know that you shouldn't be
up and about like this?

247
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,754
Your artery, nerve, and three tendons
were damaged!

248
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,104
Even if the surgery
may have been a success,

249
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,939
you have to stay in the hospital room
and rest for now.

250
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,416
Stop picking at stupid things.

251
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,441
Don't cause any problems. Got that?

252
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,079
Even a small injury could become infected...

253
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:33,104
...and an infection could cause
your blood vessels to get clogged!

254
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,099
I'm saying this as your doctor.

255
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:38,189
Don't make things more complicated
and go back to your room now.

256
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,837
You're the one making my situation
more complicated!

257
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,911
Don't you get that?

258
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,832
I've been working so hard
for the past five years.

259
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:49,632
I tried so hard to get back to this point!

260
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,327
Whatever...

261
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:01,150
I'll just make one request of you, okay?

262
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,483
I don't know how long you'll be
at Doldam Hospital...

263
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,745
...but let's just pretend
that we're strangers while you're here.

264
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:11,499
And let's not even talk
unless it's related to hospital work. Okay?

265
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,628
Dr Yoon...

266
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,665
Don't even initiate any conversations
with me, Dr Kang Dong-joo.

267
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,733
And don't go digging around...

268
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,672
...information about Teacher Kim
as you please.

269
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,763
He is not someone you are allowed
to do such a thing to.

270
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,209
Do you understand, Dr Kang?

271
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:33,355
Do you like him?

272
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:41,220
Is that the reason why you stayed here
for the past five years?

273
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,178
Is that what it is?

274
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,627
Crazy little brat.

275
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,707
Crazy little brat. Crazy little brat.

276
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,285
Oh, Dr Yoo Seo-Jung!

277
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:02,520
-How's your wrist...
-Crazy little brat!

278
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,155
Me?

279
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,340
Crazy little brat! Crazy little brat!

280
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,595
Why did you say that all of the sudden?

281
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:21,795
Man, how embarrassing.
Oh man, so embarrassing!

282
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,636
We have to keep Dr Kang Dong-joo here
no matter what, Mr Director.

283
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,139
Do you know what Doldam Hospital
needs most right now?

284
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:33,607
Money, hospital equipment,
and a medical team.

285
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,541
-In other words, everything.
-You're right about that.

286
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,893
We have problems everywhere!

287
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,983
Such is the reality
of our Doldam Hospital!

288
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,303
And in order for us to solve
all of these problems at once,

289
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,287
we need to have a secret plan
up our sleeve named Kang Dong-joo!

290
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,157
I thought you said before
that he wouldn't even last a week here.

291
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,967
He won't even last a week here.
I'll bet you 50 dollars on that.

292
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,253
Or did you say three days?

293
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,198
I'll bet 100 dollars that all of this
will be decided within three days!

294
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:03,415
Well, I wasn't aware
of who Dr Kang Dong-joo was back then!

295
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,644
But I've now found out that he passed...

296
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:10,481
...the GS board exam
with the highest score in the nation!

297
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:12,479
In other words, he's the cream
of the crop!

298
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,108
We can't just let this bundle of luck
slip through our fingers!

299
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:18,449
The important thing though is how he feels.

300
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:19,951
As long as I am concerned,

301
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,022
he feels that he wants to...

302
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:25,459
"escape this wretched excuse
of a hospital as soon as possible," sir.

303
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,516
Yeah.

304
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,521
That's why we have to do all we can
to entice him into staying!

305
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,775
He got the highest score in the nation.

306
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,855
On top of that, he's young and handsome.

307
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:36,386
Soon enough, even putting up a sign
that says "Dr Kang Dong-joo is here..."

308
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,724
...will be enough to attract patients
from hundreds of kilometers away!

309
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,675
Middle-aged ladies and old women,
in particular!

310
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,956
We'll be able to get all of them in here!

311
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:47,014
Hearing such things come out of the head
of administration's mouth displeases me.

312
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,883
We're in an era in which hospitals
are service centers.

313
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:56,227
The average of our patients' opinions
about our medical team is too low!

314
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,667
What do you think, Nurse Oh?

315
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,756
Shouldn't we hear Teacher Kim's opinion
on the matter?

316
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,480
Tell Teacher Kim to walk on his own path.

317
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,871
Isn't it about time that our hospital
got itself an actually normal doctor?

318
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:14,724
-Then...
-Yes, Mr Director?

319
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:17,408
-First...
-Yes, sir?

320
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,914
Let's hear Teacher Kim's opinion
about this.

321
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,803
Organize these, please.

322
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,731
He hasn't come to work yet, Doctor.

323
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:12,900
Teacher Kim, I mean.

324
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,668
Oh, I see.

325
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,870
Have you had lunch yet?

326
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,069
It's Friday, after all.

327
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,732
So I stuffed myself.

328
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:27,247
-Check this over.
-Yes, ma'am.

329
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:30,397
Is it okay for you to be out
and about like this?

330
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,945
Did your doctor say it was okay?

331
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,616
It's Friday, after all.

332
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,789
I couldn't just lie around and do nothing.

333
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,854
I'm an emergency medicine
specialist in name, at least.

334
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:50,740
This is Doldam Hospital's ER.

335
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,840
Understood. We'll make preparations.

336
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,113
A motorcycle traffic accident!
Five injured!

337
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,277
Will be here in 5 minutes!

338
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,628
Okay!

339
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,563
The patient was in a motorcycle accident.

340
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:06,472
We've done the preliminary treatments,
but he's unconscious.

341
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,435
BP is 100/70, and the four people
behind us were also involved.

342
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:10,760
We'll start with an intubation!

343
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:12,310
Get two lines in him and a drip.

344
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,359
And get him hooked up to a pack of RBC.

345
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:30,611
That man committed a hit-and-run.

346
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm talking about the patient
you treated yesterday.

347
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:38,183
He hit two middle-schoolers,
and fled from the scene.

348
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,204
Don't worry too much, sir.

349
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:45,425
I'll talk to the insurance company
and secure funds to get your car repaired.

350
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,899
Now, would you like to drink this?

351
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:51,214
No. I don't really like fruit juice.

352
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,744
Oh, is that right?

353
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:58,041
MOTHER

354
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,612
Doctor!

355
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:07,534
You've been called by the ER.

356
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:08,741
We have a traffic accident patient.

357
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:09,950
Okay.

358
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:23,365
Our Dr Kang Dong-joo does not
really care for fruit juice.

359
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:27,818
He also does not care for calls
from his mother.

360
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,754
It's a hemoperitoneum.

361
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:42,412
He needs surgery right away.
Can you handle it?

362
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,245
Is the patient's guardian here?

363
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:46,098
We contacted them.
They'll be here in an hour.

364
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:47,273
I think it'd best if you started operating.

365
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,223
We'll have to get a consent form
signed as soon as they get here.

366
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,575
I'll start the operation after that.

367
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:53,759
But it's going to take them an hour
to get here.

368
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,430
He might go into shock due
to excessive blood loss if we wait.

369
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,597
You should start the operation.

370
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,379
The thing you should be
more worried about is your wrist.

371
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:01,869
So don't overwork it.

372
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:04,238
Go back to your hospital room and relax.

373
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,665
I'll take care of this patient myself.

374
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:08,588
Never mind.
I'll take care of this myself.

375
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,300
The GS is the one who decides
whether or not to perform surgery!

376
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,083
I'm the one who gives the orders
around here!

377
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,969
Wait until you get the consent form
signed, Seo-Jung!

378
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:17,422
No. I mean, Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

379
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,293
Are you safeguarding yourself
in case something goes wrong?

380
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,232
I'm just saying that I'm going to go
by the book.

381
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:24,877
Don't you know that doctors
can be charged with malpractice...

382
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:26,728
...if they perform surgery without consent
and something goes wrong?

383
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,037
You should think about saving
the patient first.

384
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:31,691
Why are you worrying about things
that haven't even happened yet?

385
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:35,169
I've seen tons of doctors who have been
grabbed by the collar and sued...

386
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,171
...by the patient's guardian
for being meddlesome like that!

387
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:38,852
And this isn't even my original hospital.

388
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,233
Why should I have to go
through that here?

389
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,743
Seriously.

390
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:44,970
You sure have changed
into quite a dull person.

391
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:47,614
Excuse me, but I've always been this way.

392
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:50,039
I've always gone by the book
rather than with the flow!

393
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,283
I'm not sure if you remember though.

394
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,702
Oh, really now, Doctor?

395
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:58,301
I'm so sorry I didn't see it earlier,
you little brat.

396
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,349
What did you just call me?

397
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:03,830
Never mind.

398
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,825
Move this patient to the OR now.

399
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:08,368
Let go.

400
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,155
From this point onward,
he's a general surgery patient!

401
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:11,469
Geez...

402
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,606
Both of you, stop right now!

403
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,183
Okay. Let's head to the OR.

404
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,384
Tell Dr Nam to get it ready.

405
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,518
Yes, sir.

406
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,720
No, not you.

407
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:33,830
You.

408
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,771
What are you doing?

409
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:38,661
Go get the OR ready.

410
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,640
I'll go, sir. I can do it.

411
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:44,924
No. You get out, Yoon Seo-Jung.

412
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:49,663
I'm fine now, sir. I'll be okay.
I'll do it, sir.

413
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,442
Get the hell away from this patient now!

414
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,199
Medical Code, Article Eight.

415
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,996
According to Article Three, Section 1
of the Mental Health Act...

416
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,886
...a psychiatric patient cannot be
on the medical team.

417
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,761
At the very least, I can't entrust a patient
to someone who harmed herself.

418
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,077
As of today, you're no longer qualified
to work here.

419
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,940
-Doctor...
-That's my decision.

420
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:22,701
And it's final, so don't beg.

421
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:24,582
Get out.

422
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,646
Hey, what are you doing?

423
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:51,542
Aren't you going to ready
the operating room?

424
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:53,469
Aren't you being too harsh on her?

425
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,824
How could you say
she's no longer qualified to work here?

426
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,152
Hey, Nurse Park! Nurse Park!

427
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,450
Yes, sir?

428
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:04,211
Tell Dr Nam to make preparations
for surgery...

429
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,342
and move this patient
to the operating room.

430
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,247
His guardian is still on their way,
though...

431
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:10,257
Then get their consent via phone,
or something.

432
00:28:10,324 --> 00:28:11,640
Yes, I understand.

433
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:20,811
Hey, you be in charge of the ER tonight.

434
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,196
What?

435
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:25,300
Didn't you see the emergency
medicine specialist get kicked out just now?

436
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:28,357
We don't have a specialist to take over,
so you'll have to fill in.

437
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,579
What kind of nonsense is this?

438
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:34,758
Why would a GS be on ER duty?

439
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:36,577
I'm not asking you for your opinion.

440
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,109
I'm giving you an order.

441
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,451
Judging from what I've seen,
I feel like you love orders.

442
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:44,030
So this is a special order from me,
the Chief of the Surgical Department.

443
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,586
So you be on duty tonight.

444
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:50,264
And it's Friday, so be on your guard.

445
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,002
What kind of...

446
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,026
Are you serious?

447
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:03,544
I'll cut into him now.

448
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:06,013
Cut.

449
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:24,892
As of today, you're no longer qualified
to work here.

450
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,841
CHIEF OF SURGICAL DEPARTMENT
AT GEOSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

451
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,863
Yes, Doctor? It's Kang Dong-joo.

452
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,922
Yeah, how have you been?

453
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:07,385
Of course not.
I feel like I'm going to die.

454
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:11,406
I honestly felt really bad
about sending you there this whole time.

455
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:13,875
And surgeons like you
are hard to come by nowadays.

456
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,921
I'm out here golfing with the Director.

457
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:20,146
You think you could come out
for dinner with us later?

458
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:23,085
Excuse me? Do you mean tonight, sir?

459
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:24,934
Yeah.

460
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,440
Come by and see him and get down
on your knees and beg, punk!

461
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:33,089
I'll send you the location
and time by text.

462
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:35,849
It would be good for you
to pick something up on the way.

463
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,405
You understand what I'm saying, right?

464
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:38,834
What are you doing, Chief Song?

465
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:41,785
Yes, I'll be right there, Mr Director!

466
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,419
You have to come, okay?

467
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:44,912
Doctor!

468
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:55,245
7 PM SANJUNGSHIK RESTAURANT
GANG-WON-DO, JUNG-SUN-GUN

469
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,430
37.7 KILOMETERS, 48 MINUTES BY CAR

470
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,692
48 minutes?

471
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,412
I'd have to leave the hospital
by 6 PM at the latest.

472
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:10,237
Man, what should I do?

473
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:13,600
Yes?

474
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,989
Yes, I'm coming.

475
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,375
This is driving me crazy!

476
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,985
You can't play here, kids!

477
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:33,991
What's going on?

478
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,491
They were on a family trip but got sick
after having buffet food for lunch.

479
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:40,839
Are you okay? What are you doing, Doctor?

480
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,687
He's going to die, at this rate!

481
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:43,671
Who's in charge of internal medicine?

482
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:44,993
-Director Yeo!
-Please call him.

483
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,414
Okay. Hey, over there!

484
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,167
Let's have you lay down for a second,
Patient.

485
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:51,256
Hey, let me go!

486
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:55,782
-Just a moment.
-Doctor!

487
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,140
What's going on over there?

488
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,360
It's the patients from the traffic accident.

489
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:02,896
They're fighting about who's the victim.

490
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:05,191
Stop it!

491
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,550
Calm down!

492
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:09,910
Please calm down!
Patient, let me check your injury.

493
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,009
Don't be late. Be there on time. Okay?

494
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,980
We're a lot less busy
than I'd expected, though.

495
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,497
I thought we'd be doing
back-to-back surgeries.

496
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:41,895
How's the newcomer?
Is he a bit better than the others?

497
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:42,896
He's trash.

498
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,964
Oh, what a waste!
He had a good face about him.

499
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,701
-Oh, yeah. Hey.
-Yeah?

500
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,692
I heard you told Dr Yoon to quit.

501
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,205
-Says who?
-Miss Myung-shim.

502
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:56,604
-You didn't mean that, did you?
-Yes, I did!

503
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:59,815
I'd never entrust a patient to a punk
who's so out of it.

504
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:02,900
Hey... hey! Where are you going?

505
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:07,997
Oh, Teacher Kim!

506
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:10,211
I heard that your surgery was over.

507
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,330
What is this about, sir?

508
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:17,297
Well, this little one
was growing so nicely...

509
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,280
...so I was going to leave it here
for you to enjoy.

510
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:22,090
Do you have something to discuss with me?

511
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:30,489
You know, about Dr Yoon Seo-Jung.

512
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,115
You're not really going
to kick her out, are you?

513
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,187
Who said that?

514
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:38,164
Nurse Oh told me!

515
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:39,502
You didn't mean that, did you,
Teacher Kim?

516
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,589
Are you heading out, sir?

517
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,135
Yes.

518
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,134
I'm off to go and enjoy myself.

519
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,321
But it's Friday.

520
00:33:58,388 --> 00:34:01,170
I've left Kang Dong-joo in charge.

521
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:03,112
But still, it's Friday.

522
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,219
Won't it be too much for him
to handle alone?

523
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:09,165
It's not that bad to be overwhelmed,
sometimes.

524
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:11,243
That way, those kids will gain
more experience.

525
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,443
Did you really mean what you said?

526
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,790
Regarding Dr Yoon Seo-Jung?

527
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:19,276
Yes. I meant it!

528
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:23,526
And neither Do-il nor the director
will be able to change that.

529
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:25,831
So just be aware of that, Nurse Oh.

530
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,970
Geez.

531
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:37,845
Yeah.

532
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,615
He couldn't have meant that.

533
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,686
There's no way he'd actually kick me out.

534
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,724
Let's go and try to talk to him
one more time.

535
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,263
If that doesn't work,
I'll get on my knees and beg.

536
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,376
Is Mr Lee Chun-gu's guardian here?

537
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,632
Who's Mr Lee Chun-gu's guardian?

538
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,316
-Please we need an X-ray for that person!
-Yes, sir!

539
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:55,688
THE VIP IS HERE.

540
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,783
Teacher Kim!

541
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,084
Where are you going, Teacher Kim?

542
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,412
What is it, ma'am?

543
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,297
There's a patient from a car accident
in here right?

544
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,090
I'm his family member.
Can I see him for a bit?

545
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:33,287
Oh. Please clean your hands
with this and then go in.

546
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:50,759
Yes, this is the ICU.

547
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:59,288
Mom!

548
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,426
No!

549
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:26,334
You little brat!

550
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:31,367
Oh, no! What are you doing?

551
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,870
Back up!

552
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:39,473
You killed my son,
and yet you're still alive?

553
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,259
Call people over! Quickly!

554
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,156
You can't do this, ma'am!

555
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,166
Let go of him!

556
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:48,813
My son died!

557
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:51,131
Because of you, this little brat!

558
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,476
Please stop it, ma'am!

559
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:56,977
You're even worse!

560
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,556
Why did you save him?

561
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:00,719
Why did you do it?

562
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,628
Why did you save my son's killer?

563
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:07,421
You doctors are even worse!

564
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,216
Please let go of me first, ma'am!

565
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:14,591
Why did you save him? Let go. Let go!

566
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:17,582
Why did you save my son's killer?

567
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:19,075
I'll kill you all!

568
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:20,848
I'll kill you all!

569
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:25,374
I'll kill you all!

570
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,281
I think you've misunderstood something,
ma'am.

571
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,451
But this isn't the hit-and-run driver
who killed your son!

572
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:37,546
That patient was moved
to a different room this afternoon...

573
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:38,592
...and this patient...

574
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,756
...came in here this afternoon due to
a car accident involving a motorcycle!

575
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:47,120
You almost killed an innocent person!

576
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:57,618
Get her out.

577
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,217
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

578
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,914
Let's take a look.

579
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:10,350
What a relief. He's okay.

580
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,574
-Geez...
-Dr Yoon!

581
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,435
-How are you feeling?
-I feel a lot better.

582
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:19,827
Then you can leave as soon as
you're done with the IV.

583
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:20,827
Yes, Doctor.

584
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:28,101
What do I do?

585
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,704
I have to leave now
if I don't want to be late.

586
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,013
Don't be late.
Be sure to be there on time!

587
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,078
Just forget about your pride and all that
and think about what you need to do.

588
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:50,784
Got that?

589
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,306
-Nurse?
-Yes?

590
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:56,014
Put this on the patient
on bed No. 8, and...

591
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,445
Kang Dong-joo.

592
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,114
Let's go.

593
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,643
Leave through that door right now.

594
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:24,980
It's an emergency patient!

595
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,685
He's a male, 48 years old.
And I think he's been poisoned.

596
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,635
Dr Kang!

597
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,673
Dr Kang!

598
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:41,742
No.

599
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,211
Don't turn around.

600
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:47,748
Think of this as your last chance.

601
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,354
The last chance for you to be able to
return to Geosan University Hospital!

602
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:55,259
If I turn around here,
my life will really be over.

603
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,838
Dr Kang!

604
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,114
Please, save my son!

605
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,041
Please, save my son!

606
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:11,351
Doctor! Please, Doctor!

607
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:17,035
Please, save my son! Doctor!
Please, Doctor!

608
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:21,537
Please, save my son! Please, save my son!

609
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,827
Doctor! Please, Doctor!

610
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:26,652
Please, save my son!

611
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:37,764
Please, save my son!

612
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,537
Please, save my son!

613
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,667
Darn it.

614
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:54,713
Male, in his 40s.
He inhaled a lot of pesticides.

615
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:57,789
-Do you know what the chemical was?
-Organophosphate.

616
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:00,618
Get some charcoal ready and find out
how many vials of atropine we have.

617
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,329
Yes, sir.

618
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:02,966
Let's move him to the hybrid room.

619
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,627
Wait. I'd like to ask the guardians
to wait outside, please.

620
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:09,329
This way, please. He'll be okay.

621
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:11,503
Please, this way. He'll be okay.

622
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:17,747
Is someone else supposed to be coming?

623
00:42:17,814 --> 00:42:21,285
Oh, to be honest, I invited Kang Dong-joo.

624
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:24,638
It's not because he did anything right,
or anything.

625
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:27,981
It's because we're lacking fellows
in our surgical department.

626
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:31,033
You know what dire straits we're in, sir.

627
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,513
And kids these days don't really come
to the surgical department anymore.

628
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,823
We have tons of patients, but no fellows.

629
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:41,506
This isn't about Kang Dong-joo.
Please save me, Mr Director.

630
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:45,576
What about the list of cardiothoracic
surgeons who'll be taking care...

631
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:47,139
...of the chairman of the board's surgery?

632
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:48,479
Don't worry, sir.

633
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,786
We're only assembling
the finest surgeons for it.

634
00:42:50,853 --> 00:42:53,814
You do know that we have
a director's meeting in two months, right?

635
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:55,042
Of course, sir.

636
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,242
We'll do our very best for your sake, sir.

637
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:00,408
Please, have some of this.

638
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:01,869
Consider it my sincere feelings
for you, sir.

639
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,679
-How many liters is this?
-7 liters.

640
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:12,847
-What about the ABG results?
-Here you are, Doctor.

641
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:18,409
The pH is 6.8?
Get me five doses of sodium bicarbonate.

642
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,078
-I'll be intubating him now!
-Yes, sir.

643
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:24,538
-I came here just for this.
-Oh, really good.

644
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:40,216
I'll be checking his pulse!

645
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:42,252
One more time!

646
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,195
The defibrillator is ready, sir.

647
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:51,765
Go!

648
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:10,617
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

649
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,586
Has this punk gone mad?

650
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,260
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!
What are you doing, punk?

651
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,495
It's almost 9 PM. Why aren't you here?

652
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:25,040
Did something bad happen?
Or are you trying to piss me off?

653
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,103
Oh, Mr Director. You're already leaving?

654
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,953
I'm tired, so I can't stay long.

655
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,842
Wait, Mr Director. I...

656
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:39,012
Hey, Kang Dong-joo, you little brat!

657
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:41,851
It's the end for you now. You got that?

658
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,389
Please...

659
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:51,815
Dr Kang.

660
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:21,622
You have to declare him dead.

661
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:25,980
It's 9:29 PM right now.

662
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:30,235
Why did I...

663
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,020
Your son...

664
00:46:00,797 --> 00:46:02,244
...has passed away.

665
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:09,460
Listen, could you say that
a bit louder, Doctor?

666
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:16,516
My wife and I didn't bring our hearing aids
because we were in a rush.

667
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,909
I said your son has passed away.

668
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,155
What did he say?

669
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,286
I can't hear you!

670
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,615
Excuse me.

671
00:46:34,682 --> 00:46:38,171
Our son may be a bit older...

672
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:41,736
...but he has to meet a good woman
and get married.

673
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:46,725
So please fix him up well.
Please, Doctor.

674
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:48,881
Why did I...

675
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:52,569
I told you that your son is dead.

676
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,007
He didn't make it and died!

677
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:15,936
Doctor...

678
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:23,829
I need to see his bride before I die.
Please.

679
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:33,186
He's my precious son.
The only one I have.

680
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,201
Please, save him. Please.

681
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:44,131
I'm sorry.

682
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:06,577
Why did I...

683
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:10,357
I'm sorry.

684
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:15,395
My son!

685
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:17,881
Oh, my son!

686
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:29,446
Hey, Kang Dong-joo, you little brat!
It's the end for you now.

687
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:30,572
You got that, punk?

688
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,378
MOTHER

689
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:56,094
Yes?

690
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:58,235
Is that you, Dong-joo?

691
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,673
It's me, Mom!

692
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,003
Have you been busy this whole time?

693
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,893
You haven't called, so...

694
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:17,652
It's been hard, hasn't it?

695
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:01,865
We managed to get through Friday
just fine, thanks to Dr Kang.

696
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:07,372
But you overdid it by leaving the ER
to Dr Kang all by himself.

697
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:08,542
Hurry and head back.

698
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:11,523
I still have some business
to take care of.

699
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,414
I'll head back as soon as
I'm done taking care of it.

700
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:03,230
I heard you had a showdown with the woman
causing a ruckus in the ICU.

701
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:04,295
And with that hand, too.

702
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:15,035
Looks like your fever hasn't gone up.

703
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:25,021
There's no swelling,
and you have no fever.

704
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,937
You're doing a lot better
than I'd imagined.

705
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:30,336
What are you doing?

706
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,074
I'm checking your condition,
as the doctor in charge of you.

707
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,571
I want another doctor.
Assign me a different one.

708
00:51:35,638 --> 00:51:38,628
There isn't anyone else
at this miserable hospital.

709
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,956
Want me to call Teacher Kim,
or something?

710
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:48,033
That'd be a bit tough, huh?

711
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,908
He's the one who dismissed you,
after all.

712
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:52,278
Do you have a death wish?

713
00:51:53,522 --> 00:51:56,183
And here I thought
that you two were super close.

714
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:58,769
He stripped you of your position.
And so easily, too.

715
00:51:58,835 --> 00:51:59,635
Hey!

716
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:03,490
Why did you even come to Doldam Hospital?

717
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:07,014
Why did you come back into my life?

718
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:09,286
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

719
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:11,540
And it just so happened
that you were here when I got here.

720
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,406
Isn't this ridiculous?

721
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:18,001
You and me and at the same hospital at that?

722
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:21,441
No, not anymore.

723
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:24,225
Because you got fired.

724
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:28,215
Wow, you're so mean.

725
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:31,969
Why did you turn into such a weirdo?

726
00:52:33,288 --> 00:52:35,609
I told you, I've always been like this.

727
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:38,718
I think you must have trouble
remembering or something.

728
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:41,636
But I've never been the type
to keep my comments to myself.

729
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:42,837
Sure, sure.

730
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:45,132
It must be so nice to be as great as you.

731
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,257
Why did you take those sedatives?

732
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,301
Whatever. Leave. I'm tired.

733
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:16,606
You're not leaving?

734
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:21,118
I told you, I don't want to see you.
So get out of here.

735
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:25,018
I missed you though.

736
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:32,806
It's true.

737
00:54:11,184 --> 00:54:12,508
Yes, this is Kang Dong-joo.

738
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:16,823
We have four burn victims.

739
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,498
Please hurry downstairs.

740
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,692
Burn victims?

741
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:24,021
Did she say burn victims?
How many of them are there?

742
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:26,531
Four of them.

743
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,519
The patients are here.
Please hurry, Dr Kang.

744
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,073
In fact...

745
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,086
What are you doing? Hurry down there!

746
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:43,229
I've never seen a burn victim before.

747
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,527
What?

748
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,990
One with second-degree burns,
two with first-degree burns.

749
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,660
And there's one with third-degree burns!

750
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,093
Please send the patient with the
third-degree burns to the hybrid room.

751
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,228
And put the rest here!

752
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,329
Yes!

753
00:55:01,157 --> 00:55:02,977
Dr Kang, please take care of the patient
with the third-degree burn first.

754
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:14,163
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get in there!

755
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:28,235
First, get up and intubate the patient.

756
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,097
Intubation.

757
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:33,233
Here you are.

758
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:36,203
Please.

759
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:39,971
His neck is already swollen.

760
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:43,211
It is? Then do a cricothyroidotomy.

761
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:44,302
Please make preparations
for a cricothyroidotomy.

762
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:45,143
Yes, sir.

763
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:49,082
-Wait a second. Tube, please.
-Why a tube?

764
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,276
Hey, what are you doing?

765
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:55,981
Hey, Kang Dong-joo!

766
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:04,031
Please stabilize No. 23.

767
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:16,647
There we go.

768
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,765
Put two lines in him.
Two liters of hydration.

769
00:56:19,832 --> 00:56:21,754
Put two lines in him and give me
two liters of hydration.

770
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:22,672
Yes, sir.

771
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,780
Hey, wait. Warm saline solution!

772
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:27,020
-Warm saline solution, please!
-Yes, sir.

773
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:29,297
Okay, that's good for now.

774
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:31,300
Now it's time to look at the burns.

775
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:33,248
Take a look at the burns
on his back first.

776
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:34,495
Okay.

777
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:35,896
Take this, please.

778
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,000
Please get him on a breathing machine.

779
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,390
-And check on his carboxyhemoglobin levels.
-Yes, sir.

780
00:56:47,173 --> 00:56:49,256
Doctor, the patient's oxygen saturation
level is falling!

781
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,602
Oh, his respiratory system
must be damaged.

782
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:52,012
I'll intubate that patient.

783
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,116
Move over.

784
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,093
Doctor!

785
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:05,248
What happened to your face?

786
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:07,408
Okay, hydrate this patient.

787
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:10,148
Where's the third-degree burn victim?

788
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:14,258
He's with Dr Kang in the hybrid room.
Are you okay, Teacher Kim?

789
00:57:15,744 --> 00:57:18,872
Okay, call the burn center
and ask them to send us a helicopter.

790
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,526
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir!

791
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,112
He'll probably take four weeks
to fully recover from all that.

792
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,180
How did he get beaten up so badly?

793
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:27,516
I know.

794
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:33,665
Okay, you're doing well.

795
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:35,357
Oh? Geez...

796
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:39,244
Dr Kang.

797
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:43,363
What? What is it?

798
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:46,687
It seems that he has no circulation here.

799
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:47,917
His hand is blue.

800
00:57:47,983 --> 00:57:49,899
It must be burned through.

801
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,059
Hurry and perform an escharotomy.

802
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,437
An escharotomy?

803
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:55,117
Cut away the burned skin!

804
00:58:05,962 --> 00:58:07,806
What are you doing?

805
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:10,614
If you don't do it now, his skin will shrivel
and he'll lose all circulation!

806
00:58:10,681 --> 00:58:12,759
And if that happens, he's done for!

807
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,932
Man, how frustrating.

808
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:17,910
What's with him?

809
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:30,444
Doctor.

810
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:41,630
Our Friday night isn't over yet.

811
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:05,241
Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim

812
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:08,542
Why are you acting like an idiot?
You didn't do anything wrong.

813
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:11,795
Dragging Yoon Seo-Jung in like that...
You did that because of the burn victim.

814
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:12,829
It was your fault.

815
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:17,157
All you people who put your lives on
the line for stupid titles are the same.

816
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,492
Stupid little brat...

817
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,052
How dare you say that?
You don't know anything about me!

818
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,332
You don't even know what it's like
to live a proper life!

819
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:27,295
So don't try to teach me
how to live a proper life.

820
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:30,426
Because it's disgusting.

821
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:37,990
