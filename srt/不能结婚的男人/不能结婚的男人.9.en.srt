Episode 9

4
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,923
Why are you here outside my house?

5
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:32,062
Oh, at the shop over here,

6
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,812
I bought meat and was on my way home.

7
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,758
Why?

8
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:46,993
Nothing.

00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,106
<i>{\a6}(*match-making session
with marriage in mind)</i>

10
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:53,135
Ah! I heard you went to a seon* today, right?

11
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,278
You asked about this on the phone earlier too, why are you pretending now?

12
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:01,261
<i>{\a6}(*match-making session
with marriage in mind)</i>

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,274
You heard "today I'm going for a matseon*" then,

14
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,667
my phone ran out of battery.

15
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:10,394
When I got to the seon, I realized that man I met previously showed up again.

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,979
Such things happen?

17
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,339
It seems so.

18
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:23,825
So, you think this is a destined second meeting or something?

19
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,335
Maybe so.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,309
Will you be getting married?

21
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,466
I'm lying. In ten minutes, I was out.

22
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:53,695
What? Why did you lie?

23
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:57,340
Jo Jae Hee also lies, pretending to have a girlfriend, right?

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,653
I never said anything like that.

25
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,575
Since my matseon was unsuccessful, why are you being this happy?

26
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,667
No, that's not it.

27
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:27,131
To be rejected by the same man twice,
now that's funny.

28
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,047
That's not what happened.

29
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,707
Well, no need to be embarrassed.

30
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:38,302
Because of your age,

31
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,100
in future, such things may happen
again in your matseons.

32
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:46,192
You waited for me outside my house just to say such things?

33
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:49,015
I'm here to buy meat.

34
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,726
Don't be too discouraged.

35
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:56,778
Somewhere out there, there's a man who knows the worth of Dr Jang.

36
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,046
Toying with people's feelings, is that fun for you?

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,108
How can a human be so despicable?

38
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:04,434
Ha! Meat?

39
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,094
I should have just ignored you.

40
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,990
Ah, really.

41
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:23,130
Ah! My vertebra.

42
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:05,290
Oh, ahjussi!

43
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,257
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

44
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,128
Oh, why won't you answer me?

45
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,500
We're acquaintance, right?

46
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,396
Right now, some weird guy seems to be following me.

47
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:20,350
If you're afraid of that, you should stay home at this hour.

48
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,425
Hey, I just got off work, you know.

49
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:25,935
Oh!

50
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,961
Oh.

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,131
Mister Jo!

52
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,980
Hello.

53
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:43,176
Why are you looking at me like that?

54
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,474
What is the matter?

55
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,135
You two together, why did you come back from?

56
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:52,481
We're not together, we met over there.

57
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,062
Let's go up.

58
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,232
Where are you going up to?

59
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,313
Of course to your house, Mister Jo. Where else?

60
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,921
This ahjussi won't let anyone into his house.

61
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,914
But this elderly who came all the way here,

62
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,221
are you going to chase me away?

63
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:33,653
Please speak quickly.

64
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,091
The vitality of meat lies in its freshness.

65
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,359
Accept this.

66
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:42,863
What is this?

67
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,739
Do you frequent this place all the time?

68
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,079
No!

69
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,945
I specially provided a meeting place for you two,

70
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,285
I feel so wronged to hear you say that.

71
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,890
This is....

72
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,160
You want it?

73
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,324
No.

74
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,101
This man!

75
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,741
How can you give it away in front of the giver?

76
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,251
Jang Bong Soo Dentist.

77
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:28,271
It's a gift for my patients upon my retirement.

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,343
You were my last patient, weren't you?

79
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:32,539
So I delivered it here myself.

80
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,409
<i>But,</i>

81
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,611
can you not be so fierce towards me?

82
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,546
<i>I like Dr Jang very much,</i>

83
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,080
but her father dislikes me.

84
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,753
So I'm feeling sad.

85
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,707
I really have nothing to do with this ahjussi.

86
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,374
I, too, have nothing to do with Dr Jang.

87
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,099
I have a boyfriend too.

88
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,698
And that guy is my assistant.

89
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,611
That’s right.

90
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,679
Ah, open your mouth.

91
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:56,346
What?

92
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,875
Ah.

93
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,117
Ah.

94
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,409
Ah.

95
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,403
Ah.

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,416
Ah.

97
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,468
Oh, the treatment worked well.

98
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,433
Is this your only motive?

99
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,367
I have a request.

100
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:23,630
Please stop.

101
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,787
Really, it's my final request.

102
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:27,813
I understand.

103
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,663
Hey.

104
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,676
Can you tell me your mother's
telephone number please?

105
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,385
Old man!

<i>Please sit.</i>

111
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,774
What's making you sick today?

112
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:29,277
Ah! The back of my neck is so heavy.

113
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:30,741
The back of your neck?

114
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,703
Give me your arm.

115
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,930
I'm sorry about yesterday.

116
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,015
Yes.

117
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:54,492
Why are you going on vacation during the peak period?

118
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,976
Stuck in all that family travel of other people,

119
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,766
that's even more lonely.

120
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,002
The blood pressure is same as before.

121
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,341
Tightness in the back of the neck and a heavy head,

122
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,080
if it's accompanied by a continuous headache,

123
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,845
then we'll have to suspect obstruction to your blood circulation.

124
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:19,320
Would you like to do further tests?

125
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:24,238
Yesterday....I'm sorry.

126
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,278
There's no prescription for you today.

127
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,219
After complete rest, if your symptoms still don't ease up,

128
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,682
then come again.

129
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:31,767
That's all.

130
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:19,945
Sigh, I'm not doing that anymore.

131
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,748
Never again, I'll never be sucked
into your pace again.

132
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,505
<i>Yes?</i>

133
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,325
<i>Oh, come in.</i>

134
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,574
<i>How do you feel today?
Have you eaten?</i>

135
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,429
Assigned to the shop front?

136
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:14,487
Hey, that's great.

137
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,865
Yes, from today onwards, I'm going to be at the shop.

138
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:21,264
Hyun Kyu, what should I do?
I'm so nervous.

139
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,911
Hey, is it because the other time I helped you with the marketing report?

140
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:25,826
Isn't it?

141
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:29,242
Oh yes, today together with Soo Young and Dr Jang,

142
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,438
we plan to have a celebration party at the shop.

143
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:32,837
You join us too.

144
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:36,640
Party? Of course I have to be there.

145
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,329
Got it.

146
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,551
Where are you going?

147
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:48,050
Why are you suddenly interested in my private life?

148
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:50,769
Interested? Says who?

149
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,077
I'm checking if my employee's way of living,

150
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,907
will affect his work performance the next day.

151
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,893
Segregate work and private life, isn't that what you always say?

152
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,288
A celebration?

153
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,707
For her becoming a permanent employee?

154
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:12,066
One that her friends will show up at?

155
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,876
Should I tell you who else will show up?

156
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,151
I think Dr Jang will be there too.

157
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,800
Why are you bringing up Dr Jang suddenly?

158
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,598
I thought you might be interested to know.

159
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,473
Who says I'm interested?

160
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,761
Forget it, I won't go.

161
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,311
I didn't invite you to go anyway.

162
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,758
Under the current economy, for both of you to get permanent positions,

163
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,170
it's like winning the lottery.

164
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,634
<i>- That's right.
- Yes.</i>

165
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:50,921
Do you get an increase in pay?

166
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:54,477
I don't know.
Maybe a little.

167
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:11,972
You're still not done?

168
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,025
- Just do what you can.
- I'm almost done.

169
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,096
Hello!

170
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:16,979
<i>Oh! Dr Jang.</i>

171
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:19,040
<i>Congratulations on becoming permanent employees.</i>

172
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,315
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

173
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,798
- Congratulations.
- Me too?

174
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,269
Dr Jang, sit here.

175
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,341
So we'll start now,

176
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:58,707
the cake-cutting ceremony to commemorate Yu Jin and Soo Young becoming permanent employees.

177
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:08,267
Did the two of you quarrel?

178
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,124
I think so.

179
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,241
I think they did.

180
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,195
Is this made by Yu Jin?

181
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,215
- It looks delicious.
- Yes, please have this.

182
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,992
Thanks.

183
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,564
What's different?

184
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:29,642
Every time I apologize, you always accepted it.

185
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,904
What's different this time round?

186
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,018
I accepted your apology.

187
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:40,024
But this time it's different from usual, right?

188
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:41,345
Is that so?

189
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:48,060
I don't know what this is about but I think she's still unhappy about something.

190
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,759
See!

191
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,471
Ahjussi, did you do something wrong?

192
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,629
I don't know.

193
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:01,564
Director, women hate that the most.

194
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:06,123
You don't know what you did wrong,
yet you apologize unconditionally.

195
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,908
She's not angry,

196
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,712
she's not friendly,

197
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,664
it's strange and it makes me uncomfortable.

198
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,631
That's why I hate human relations.

199
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,808
If you hate it then don't have any.

200
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,194
If I'm an annoying human relation to Mr. Jo Jae Hee,

201
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,364
then you can just stop it, can't you?

202
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,004
No, it's not that.

203
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:33,710
No, whether that's it or not,

204
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:36,102
you should think before you speak.

205
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:37,756
Words that come out of the mouth of Mr. Jo Jae Hee,

206
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:40,540
already went into my ears,
and affected how I feel.

207
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,618
I'm sorry, Yu Jin, I'll leave now.
Let's have a party later just for us.

208
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,840
- I'm off, sorry.
- Dr Jang!

209
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,810
<i>I'll call you.</i>

210
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,156
Ah, really.

211
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,131
It's all ahjussi's fault.

212
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,595
Director!

213
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,667
Dr Jang seems to be really angry.

214
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:08,091
That means ahjussi made a fatal mistake.

215
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,638
Shall I check it out for you?

216
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,527
Why do you like to interfere in other's business?

217
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,527
Oh!

218
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:19,669
That's the man from the other time, right?

219
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:21,983
A despicable man!

220
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,787
Why? Is he the one who laughed at you for not having a girlfriend?

221
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,081
Well...

222
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,985
Hey!

223
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,436
Hello.

224
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:44,599
You must be real busy lately.

225
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,893
Not as busy as you.

226
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:52,190
What are you doing now?

227
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,869
Pretending to be your girlfriend.

228
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,484
Oh, he looks so greasy.

229
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,079
He sure looks like a playboy.

230
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,817
It's a different girl this time.

231
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:04,940
Ahjussi,

232
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,593
you've never walked with a girl on your arm, right?

233
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:09,789
If a girl hooked arms with you,

234
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,704
you must do this to look comfortable.

235
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,697
Are you embarrassed now?

236
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,868
That's why I hate human relations.

237
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,195
If you hate it then don't have any.

238
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:43,606
If I'm an annoying human relation to Mr. Jo Jae Hee, then you can just stop it, can't you?

239
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,536
Hey, the movers will pack it for us,

240
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,078
why do you bother?

241
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:04,274
No, I must do this myself.
It'll break and it's expensive.

242
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,986
Mom,

243
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,529
can't grandma move there with us?

244
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:14,549
Oh, you just jabbed me where it hurts.

245
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:18,735
Mom,

246
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,645
after we move in with my in-laws,

247
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:22,959
what will you do eating by yourself every day?

248
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:24,972
When you're there, be nice to your in-laws,

249
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,527
don't worry about me.

250
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:29,168
Call oppa often and have dinner together or something.

251
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,419
- Alright?
- Oh, she's nagging again. I know.

252
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,759
How many times have you told me that?

253
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,550
Aigoo, aigoo.

254
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:39,279
Hey, you finish wrapping these up.

255
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,174
I have to check on the porcelain in the living room.

256
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,403
It's all done.

257
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,194
Aigoo, just wrap those up.

258
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,998
Forget it.

259
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,958
I told you, forget it.

260
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,599
Mom!

261
00:18:57,318 --> 00:19:00,055
The error distance is not even 0.01mm,

262
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:02,199
I heard of his achievements in the main hospital too.

263
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,297
I think father is planning to take him in.

264
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:06,892
Call me when you get the results.

265
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,597
Hey, wait a minute.

266
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,113
How about a drink?

267
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,950
Once drinks are mentioned, she calls.

268
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:14,927
<i>{\a6} [My Sky]</i>

269
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,963
Like a ghost.

270
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:17,721
I'm off, pal.

271
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:18,859
Alright.

272
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:21,731
Hi, honey.

273
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:24,031
<i>What should we do? Mom just fainted.</i>

274
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:24,972
What?

275
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:28,933
Oh, I got it.

276
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,684
<i>Mom!</i>

277
00:19:56,717 --> 00:20:00,064
Her blood pressure and pulse are normal.

278
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,882
Her irregular pulse is temporary, is that right?

279
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:03,784
Yes.

280
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,921
She'll turn better once she rests.

281
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:09,379
What's the family history like?

282
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:13,400
The other time, Jo Jae Hee also got admitted into hospital with an irregular pulse too.

283
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:18,653
<i>{\a6}(*irregular pulse, anemic)</i>

284
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:18,681
Your grandmother had ischemic arrhythmia* symptoms too, right?

285
00:20:18,773 --> 00:20:19,688
Yes,

286
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,028
I remember that.

287
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:25,758
Then it's better if we do some tests on her tomorrow.

288
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,333
Oppa!

289
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,817
What happened?

290
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,814
Well, tonight Jae Hee will be here,

291
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,174
so you can go home.

292
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,448
Ye Won must have gotten a shock too.

293
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:43,452
Go on.

294
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:44,249
Honey,

295
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:45,086
what?

296
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:51,883
Shall we postpone moving in with your family, just a little?

297
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,276
What?

298
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,041
The things have all been packed already.

299
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,727
What are you talking about?

300
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:00,021
I know this is because of your mom....

301
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:08,557
If we postpone it, when will we move in?

302
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,047
After oppa gets married and mom lives with him, then?

303
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,380
You might as well say never!

304
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:23,144
Is this the time for you to shout at me?

305
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,386
Huh?

306
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,307
Jo Jae Hee.

307
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:43,510
Yes?

308
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,061
You're awake?

309
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:58,378
I can't leave you behind without marrying you off.

310
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,868
Hey, what are you saying?

311
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,796
You....

312
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:13,620
can you really imagine what it's like to be alone?

313
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:19,743
I've always been alone, right?

314
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,551
After I die then you'd become really alone.

315
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:40,760
No one to truly care for you,

316
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,690
that's such a lonely thing.

317
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:52,014
Independence? By yourself?

318
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:55,087
Hey,

319
00:22:57,423 --> 00:23:03,103
no matter how naughty you are, before I die,

320
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:08,946
you're still the child in my arms.

321
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,695
You naughty fella.

322
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,809
<i>Jo Jae Hee,
are you alright?</i>

323
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,469
Your mother is not terminally ill,
so you don't have to worry.

324
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,394
Dr Jang,

325
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,322
it hurts too much.

326
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,732
But it's alright,

327
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:47,752
because I'm a man. Ah! Ah!

328
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,986
It's done.

329
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:19,457
My mother....is she really alright?

330
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,352
Since her pulse was irregular only temporarily,

331
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:24,178
with rest, she will get better.

332
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:28,008
That old woman, faking her shouts of pain....

333
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,211
Let's go.

334
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:36,565
Now, you're not angry anymore?

335
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,912
You said human relation with me was annoying.

336
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:43,232
Oh that? It just came out.

337
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:50,866
It's always been annoying for me, human relations and such.

338
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:54,480
Whenever I talk to Jo Jae Hee,

339
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:56,663
I always get hurt.

340
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:02,584
Let's go.

341
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,447
<i>{\a6}(*for weaving girl to meet herds boy)</i>

342
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:19,455
Who cares if it's five or six magpie bridge*?

343
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:21,259
Why is the progress so slow?

344
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:23,219
Have you gotten a serial number?

345
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:26,224
Oh, serial number....

346
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,002
The man from the previous matseon raised an objection.

347
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,309
Objection?

348
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:38,201
He said the woman is way older than reported.

349
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:44,938
You must bring the serial number and proof of employment as a medical specialist from SD Hospital.

350
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:47,932
This woman.....it's not as it this is a detective agency.

351
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:51,239
We only believe in what our eyes can see.

352
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,670
Being in charge of a marriage between two families,

353
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,053
how can I not check it out?

354
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,168
This is the next man lined up for the matseon.

355
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:03,573
He's a lawyer.

356
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,880
If he's one looking for funds to set up of his law firm, he's not even worth mentioning.

357
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,190
Next this man here is also a lawyer.

358
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,812
He has a 7-year old daughter,

359
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:21,310
but his grandmother will take care of the child for life.

360
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,859
A married man is definitely out!

361
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:27,911
That's why, that's why,
where is your serial number?

362
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:30,543
Really.

363
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:33,405
I explained before,

364
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:35,798
any prospective bride above the age of 37,

365
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,425
must agree to it even if the man was married before.

366
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:41,177
<i>Sure, this might not be your case,</i>

367
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:45,517
but if the prospective bride is above the age of 39,

368
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:52,115
then the prospective groom's age will be adjusted to 46 and above.

369
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:28,219
Dr Jang, water got in when I bathed.

370
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:29,317
Eun Hee,

371
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,638
Yes?

372
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,603
Please take a look at Mr. Jo Jae Hee here.

373
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,492
But....

374
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,551
- Please come over here.
- Dr Jang.

375
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,076
That hurts.

376
00:28:56,644 --> 00:29:01,651
On the proof of employment, the age will show too.....

377
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,092
Aigoo.
Aigoo.

378
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:07,588
Aigoo.

379
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:09,065
Aigoo.

380
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:12,374
Aigoo.

381
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,433
Hey, look here.

382
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:17,982
How can you be walking around with such things?

383
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,518
As the young people would say nowadays, you're very 'over,' you know.

384
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,622
What do you mean 'over?' The stuff can be shaken off you but,

385
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,590
for me....

386
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,675
here, what are you going to do about this?

387
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:34,555
What do you mean 'shaken off?'
You're trying to scam me,

388
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,111
see if I'll give you 3,500 won?

389
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,823
3,500 won?

390
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:41,274
Aigoo, what a waste of my juice!

391
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:45,540
Aigoo, I came out just to get this.

392
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:50,259
This...is pineapple juice, you know.

393
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,890
Hey, an apology wouldn't even be enough,

394
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,805
this here, what are you going to do?

395
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,857
This is a corner here,

396
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:01,092
the fault lies with both parties.

397
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:03,190
We should each wash our own.

398
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,883
Aigoo, I'm a patient, you know.

399
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:08,954
You shouldn't have shouted at me, right?

400
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:15,080
What? Wash our own?

401
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,152
Hey!

402
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,714
Just take off your patient uniform then let's talk.

403
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,904
Hey!

404
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:22,296
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

405
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,248
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

406
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,843
<i>I'm heading to the office.</i>

407
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:29,751
Mister Jo?

408
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,738
I think this is not the place.

409
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:34,828
This...

410
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:40,658
<i>Your mom is in this state and you're still going to the office?</i>

411
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:43,024
It's getting cold, please eat.

412
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:47,658
Well...

413
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:54,037
the stress of your knee pain will cause irregular pulse as well, mother.

414
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,036
How about take this opportunity to do the surgery?

415
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:00,317
<i>After the surgery, you can even climb mountains,</i>

416
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:01,938
and ride bicycles,

417
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,127
the world gets bigger and you'll have a new life, right? Mother.

418
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:06,181
Aigoo.

419
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:08,510
I don't want to. No surgery for me.

420
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,134
I can live with it.

421
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:13,606
Say something.

422
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:17,275
I think she can't trust her son-in-law.

423
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:20,870
Agreeing with the son-in-law to do the surgery, does that make you uneasy?

424
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:27,248
No matter how hard you try, she's not going to budge.

425
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:29,954
Who says I don't trust my son-in-law?

426
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:33,536
Everything my son didn't do for me, my son-in-law did.

427
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:37,774
Oh, there'll be pain and I'm afraid.
I won't do it.

428
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:41,134
When it gets really unbearable,
then I'll do it.

429
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:44,794
Get out and do your work now.

430
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:46,761
Yes, I'm off.

431
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:49,401
Rest well.

432
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,199
Yes?

433
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:01,971
Oh!

434
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:11,222
This must be about the laundry fee, right?

435
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:17,425
Well, Dr Jang Mun Jung from Internal Medicine dept is my daughter.

436
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,660
<i>My name is Jang Bong Soo.</i>

437
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,307
Oh!

438
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:08,169
What is it?

439
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:10,849
Pervert.

440
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:13,738
Manager Yun!

441
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:15,960
Manager Yun?

442
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,516
Then you're Director Jo?

443
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,361
Oh, you're here.

444
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:28,244
<i>I thought you might know each other,</i>

445
00:33:28,296 --> 00:33:30,152
<i>but may not know each other's exact identify,</i>

446
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,662
I'll introduce you.

447
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,073
Director Jo Jae Hee.

448
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:34,707
Director Mun Seok Hwan.

449
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,544
Well, it might be a little late,

450
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,296
but let's greet each other.

451
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,261
I'm Mun Seok Hwan.

452
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:48,071
I'm Jo Jae Hee.

453
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,166
What is your business here at this office?

454
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:07,284
As an architect just like you,

455
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,441
I respect you, Director Jo.

456
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:11,585
What?

457
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:15,806
Your works are truly the best.

458
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,551
I'm an architect too but when I built my house,

459
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,375
I will definitely entrust that to you, Director Jo.

460
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:30,224
Well, when the time comes and if I'm free, we'll see.

461
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,041
Since you're here, let's start the meeting.

462
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:37,619
Yes, I'll just put down my bag first.

463
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:48,501
What?

464
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,331
So he's much better than I thought, after all.

465
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,477
Director Jo.... do you respect him a lot?

466
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:04,000
Looking at the muscles on his shoulder,

467
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,391
it'll be so easy to make him stumble.

468
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,626
Who are you to make him stumble?

469
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:11,384
Director Jo is in charge of our project, you know.

470
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:16,734
But at the bar, why did he pretend not to know me?

471
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:22,093
I'm one who segregates the private areas from the work areas.

472
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:24,734
Ah, I see.

473
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:25,871
That means,

474
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:30,899
to segregate private and work areas, you pretended not to know me, is that right?

475
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:33,265
Something like that.

476
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,237
What's this?

477
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:46,022
Director Jo Jae Hee,
congratulations!

478
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,987
You know the Wando Sunshine Village, right?

479
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:58,676
That village which will disappear in four months?

480
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:02,453
We managed to get a new address to do that project.

481
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,473
We?

482
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,218
Jo Jae Hee Architect Office,

483
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:10,107
secured this project.

484
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,335
The project we've always wanted to do,

485
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,332
now we finally get to do it.

486
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,292
Sunshine Village, at least 50% can be transferred?

487
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:33,598
Director Mun Seok Hwan did quite a lot to help us out.

488
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:37,990
Has the new address for transfer been decided yet?

489
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:47,707
<i>{\a6}(*1 pyeong=3.3058 square meters)</i>

490
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,284
I've already secured a plot of 6,000 pyeong*.

491
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:47,709
We need 8,000 pyeong*, don't we?

492
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:52,327
Director Mun said he agrees to work under Director Jo.

493
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:59,242
Well, it doesn't matter who it is.

494
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:05,841
Anyhow, my work will proceed without any mistakes according to my plan.

495
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:13,574
Yes, yes. Indeed, just like it is in the grapevine.

496
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:23,320
Anyway, here's to our happily working together.

497
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:30,719
Here.

498
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:37,720
Let's get to the point.

499
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,347
Yes, let's get to the point.

500
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:46,869
Mister Jo pretends to be ill and frequents my daughter's clinic, did you know that?

501
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:48,830
What?

502
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:53,183
I fully understand.

503
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:59,306
A man's confidence is directly proportional to his physical condition.

504
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,574
At age 40, his physical strength starts to drop.

505
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:06,180
So will his confidence too.

506
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,769
He'll think he can't be a real man anymore,

507
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:14,403
so he gets the feeling that he can't say so even when he likes someone.

508
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,738
Hey you!

509
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:18,326
Who's not a real man?

510
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:23,346
No, that's not what I meant,
as a woman, you may not understand.

511
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:26,106
That's the heart of a man, I tell you.

512
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,943
Although I don't know much about a man's physical condition,

513
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,858
I know very well the heart of a woman.

514
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,216
Is Dr Jang a common woman?

515
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:40,197
Otherwise why would she take a patient

516
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:44,380
as someone who likes her, and lie to her own father?

517
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,275
Lie?

518
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,262
So it's not the son pretending to be ill and failing,

519
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:52,478
rather it's the mother coming out as a volunteer now, right?

520
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:57,503
You don't seem to be that sick, you know.

521
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:03,791
Is your daughter worth my putting on a show for?

522
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:08,656
My son is a talented man who nets all the architecture awards given by the country.

523
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:12,591
My daughter graduated from medical school earlier than the rest.

524
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:17,835
Isn't it weird to compare medicine to architecture?

525
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:21,508
So what? She's still not married, is she?

526
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:24,449
Can you even comment on others?

527
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,538
You're quite good at arguing.

528
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:28,577
Let's see how things turn out.

529
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,204
What a joke!

530
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:42,877
I need a doctor's proof of employment, where do I go?

531
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:45,269
Level 3, personnel dept.

532
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:52,125
All kinds of people exist.

533
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:13,601
Grandchild.....you don't have any, do you?

534
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:16,712
Is Dr Jang an only child?

535
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:20,486
You don't even know that about my daughter yet you want her?

536
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,924
You're so pitiful.

537
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:26,970
It's such a meaningful thing to carry a grandchild.

538
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,299
Who doesn't know that?

539
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:33,341
I hate to be at gatherings.

540
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,524
Everyone's showing off their own grandchild but I don't have any.

541
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:46,185
I'm most stressed by that, you know.

542
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:48,838
"Isn't your son married yet?"

543
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,171
I really don't like to hear such things.

544
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:54,936
So you know, I....

545
00:40:55,106 --> 00:41:00,701
I always have in my bag, a photo of my son receiving a prize.

546
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:03,120
I always tell them he can't marry because of the job.

547
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:06,453
You need an excuse like that, you know.

548
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,924
Excuse me, I'm sorry but what time is it now?

549
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:38,577
Oh, it's 10.30pm.

550
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,159
I see, thank you.

551
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,659
Excuse me.

552
00:42:09,587 --> 00:42:11,583
Oh, it's so hot.

553
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,668
It's been hot recently, right?

554
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,186
The aircon is on so I'm not hot.

555
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:23,643
With the aircon on the whole day, that's not good for the body.

556
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:25,147
1,000 won please.

557
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,637
It's real cheap, right?

558
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:30,533
So I'm saying, you need to be hot just nice, cool just nice, for example,

559
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:34,311
the ocean or something, would you like that?

560
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,867
Ocean?

561
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:40,944
Ocean. That means if 3 from my side and 3 from your side go together,

562
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,009
then we'll escort you with free ice-cream....

563
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:44,211
Delicious.

564
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:46,643
But I don't really like the ocean.

565
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,242
DVD,

566
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:54,961
Cheongyang pepper,

567
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:57,641
you're sure in high spirit.

568
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,425
<i>The number you dialed is not answered, please call again later.</i>

569
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:25,948
Why isn't he answering the phone?

570
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:49,271
Ahjussi, wait a minute!

571
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,026
Ahjussi! Ahjussi, ahjussi!

572
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:54,981
Ahjussi!

573
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,157
- What?
- Behind me.

574
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:06,023
That guy?

575
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:10,442
All thanks to you, ahjussi.
Thanks.

576
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:15,786
I was really scared to death.

577
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:21,211
You know that guy had his own phone but he asked me for the time.

578
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,511
<i>I got up the bus and he followed me too.</i>

579
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:27,890
<i>Ahjussi!
Just listen to me, will you?</i>

580
00:44:29,995 --> 00:44:31,197
Good night.

581
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:32,727
Hey, 703.

582
00:44:34,578 --> 00:44:37,114
There's a problem with the way you live.

583
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:38,905
What?

584
00:44:39,297 --> 00:44:42,748
You live apart from your parents so you should constrain yourself.

585
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:44,611
And that balcony wall too,

586
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:46,337
aren't you going to seal it up?

587
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:48,127
I will seal it.

588
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,356
Well, it's connected to your house, what's there to be afraid of?

589
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,082
Just look at yourself.

590
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:58,140
Anyhow, thanks for today.

591
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,303
Lock up and sleep tight.

592
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,826
Yes, good night.

593
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:37,312
Here, it's herbal tea.

594
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:42,293
When the sand all falls down, it's time to drink.

595
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,607
If you leave it for too long, it gets bitter.

596
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:46,750
Bitter?

597
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:48,296
Bitter!

598
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:51,146
Nothing happened, right?

599
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:54,675
Luckily ahjussi appeared so I was fine.

600
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,156
I'm so sorry.

601
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:00,287
When something like that happens to you,

602
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,915
why is it that's exactly when I can't be reached?

603
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,823
What were you doing?

604
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:06,836
Work.

605
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:09,478
I've been busy recently.

606
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:10,694
Oh!

607
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:13,674
You know I can't be reached when I'm busy, right?

608
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:17,360
Ah! You're giving me a warning now before it happens again.

609
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:20,373
Here.

610
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:22,242
What's this?

611
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,281
Pull it. That black string.

612
00:46:25,353 --> 00:46:26,334
This?

613
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:39,076
This is an alarm for help.

614
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,269
From now on, I'll leave my phone on.

615
00:46:41,413 --> 00:46:44,158
If such a thing happens again, just press this,

616
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,380
then run away and call my handphone immediately.

617
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:47,452
You got it?

618
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,275
Yes.

619
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:54,608
It feels like you're really my boyfriend now.

620
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:57,772
Then what was I to you all this while?

621
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:00,216
Thank you.

622
00:47:01,816 --> 00:47:02,993
I have to go now.

623
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:03,868
I have to be at the construction site.

624
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,110
Hey, wait a minute.

625
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:07,215
Drink this before you go.
It's ready now.

626
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:10,091
Of course I have to drink it before I go, you made it for me.

627
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,604
Ready.

628
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:13,683
- It's ready?
- Drink up then go.

629
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:17,670
Hey! Drink some more.

630
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:20,075
Is that alright?

631
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:21,617
- I'm off.
- Bye.

632
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,226
Patient in room 203 looking for you.

633
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:43,269
- Now?
- Yes.

634
00:47:43,347 --> 00:47:44,994
Alright, I know.

635
00:47:51,256 --> 00:47:52,929
203 means.....

636
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:55,055
Jo Jae Hee's mother?

637
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:16,411
Huh.

638
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:26,044
I'm going in there too.

639
00:48:26,345 --> 00:48:27,169
Why?

640
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:29,652
Because the patient is looking for the doctor.

641
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:31,783
Ah!

642
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:54,910
What did we just see?

643
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:56,126
What was that?

644
00:48:56,257 --> 00:48:57,368
Isn't that right?

645
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:04,087
Why?

646
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:06,753
This is my mom's room so of course she's in there.

647
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:07,926
So,

648
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,397
what's up with my father then?

649
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,063
Come in.

650
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:18,360
I don't want to.

651
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:20,413
Father, what do you have up your sleeves again?

652
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,655
You're such.....

653
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,746
a hardworking senior.

654
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,877
Please come in, Dr Jang.

655
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:39,851
Let's get right to the point.

656
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,583
We have a wish.

657
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,491
We?

658
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:48,819
If you can fulfill that wish for us,

659
00:49:48,924 --> 00:49:52,453
I will do that knee operation without another word.

660
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:55,826
And for the rest of my life, I will never bring up about seon* again.

661
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,820
<i>{\a6}(*match-making session with marriage in mind)</i>

662
00:49:56,604 --> 00:49:57,917
Father,

663
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,118
what exactly do you want?

664
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,451
What is your wish?

665
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:03,176
You're asking because you don't know?

666
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:06,967
Pick one.

667
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:09,307
The choice belongs to the two of you.

668
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:10,864
- What?
- What?

669
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,073
All our wishes are in here,

670
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:16,341
you just have to pick one and fulfill it for us, that'll do.

671
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:21,684
Wish....it doesn't seem like what we imagine.

672
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:23,435
I think so too.

673
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,252
All our wishes are within reason, so be at ease and pick one.

674
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:32,151
This situation itself is not within reason.

675
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,465
How can you treat your seniors like this?

676
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:35,968
Pick one.

677
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,792
Please pick one.

678
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:40,191
Yes.

679
00:50:44,784 --> 00:50:46,261
We'll pick one,

680
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:49,372
but if it's totally unreasonable, we'll just head right out of here.

681
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,984
But doing this in front of my own patient is already making me feel guilty.

682
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:56,794
The ones who should feel guilty,

683
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,742
are others, not us.

684
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,255
Abracadabra.

685
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:23,477
No!

686
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:24,489
<i>No.</i>

687
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:31,276
Focus.

688
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:33,734
This?

689
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,953
No, oh!

690
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:53,325
<i>[Take a 3 Day 2 Night vacation together.
Venue: a place 3 hours away from Seoul.]</i>

691
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:57,972
3...3 days? Father!

692
00:51:58,038 --> 00:52:01,842
Oh dear! He got the easiest one.

693
00:52:01,907 --> 00:52:04,012
I told you to take that one out, didn't I?

694
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,672
If this is the easiest one,

695
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:09,372
- what exactly is in there?
- No more chance.

696
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,385
The venue is to be a place 3 hours away from Seoul.

697
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:13,790
Time period of 3 days 2 nights. That's it.

698
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:16,170
Mother-in-law!

699
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,199
What's this?

700
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:19,650
Wait outside.

701
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:20,512
Yes.

702
00:52:25,637 --> 00:52:27,065
You can't sleep together.

703
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,516
Have separate rooms.

704
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,450
Really.

705
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:37,451
Why are we doing this?
Please give it a some thought.

706
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:39,150
That's it. Resolution passed.

707
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:40,758
But father, father.....

708
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:42,471
Father, come out with me.

709
00:52:42,575 --> 00:52:44,039
Hey, hey!

710
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:03,535
No one's here, right?

711
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,339
Why must you plan something like this?

712
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,048
If in the end she still refuses to do the operation, what will you do?

713
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:12,231
Just pretend like you have no way out and just go.

714
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:13,185
I won't.

715
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,068
How can you do this?

716
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:16,519
Father, aren't you a doctor too?

717
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:18,323
Don't you have the compassion of a doctor?

718
00:53:18,506 --> 00:53:21,722
How can you put a patient's health on a slip of paper like a joke?

719
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,356
I like Mister Jo.

720
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:26,035
Then you should just tell Mister Jo that you love him, confess it to him directly.

721
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:28,323
Don't keep dragging me into it.

722
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:32,886
Aigoo, why is my mother-in-law so cute?

723
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:34,781
Cute?

724
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:36,755
She still has a bandage on her head,

725
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:39,448
yet she's trading her own health for her own son.

726
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,078
This is coercion and violence.

727
00:53:42,744 --> 00:53:43,960
It's great.

728
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:46,967
Finally we can do the operation on her.

729
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:48,143
What?

730
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,979
Her knee problem has lasted a long time,

731
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:53,714
now it's not a matter of choice anymore,

732
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,008
it's something she must get done.

733
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,413
Yet she still insists on bearing with it.
What can we do?

734
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,237
Well, we'll take this opportunity to grab her by the ankle, and make her do the operation.

735
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:12,878
You're saying I should make the trip with Dr Jang?

736
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,754
Hey, do you guys have to go for real?

737
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:18,094
And what wrong did Dr Jang do?

738
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:22,204
Her father seems to be really anxious,

739
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:24,191
his daughter is already fully grown up...

740
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:26,466
So?

741
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:32,336
3 Day 2 Night, just pretend you went, that will do it.

742
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:40,441
Really.

743
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:53,721
<i>[Take a 3 Day 2 Night vacation together.
Venue: a place 3 hours away from Seoul.]</i>

744
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:59,368
<i>[Take a 3 Day 2 Night vacation together.
Venue: a place 3 hours away from Seoul.]</i>

745
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,409
Oh, really.

746
00:55:09,148 --> 00:55:10,573
Yes, Vice-President.

747
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:14,959
Yes, that means you just have to pretend you went on the trip.

748
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,763
That's right.

749
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:19,678
Yes, thank you, Dr Jang.

750
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:22,031
She said she'll help.

751
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:27,522
This week's Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

752
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,679
You have to disappear somewhere during this time.

753
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:32,424
Make sure you match with her to say where you guys went

754
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:37,394
All kinds of things sure happen in life.

755
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:42,413
Got it.

756
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:46,673
They said they'll go.

757
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:48,699
What is it?

758
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:52,411
They said they decided to do the trip.

759
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:56,150
Oh, you're so naïve.

760
00:55:56,438 --> 00:56:00,516
So what if they made the trip and came back?

761
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:05,091
A single man and woman spends 3 days 2 nights together some place.

762
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:08,851
Is this a bet?

763
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,655
Do they come back after they did it?

764
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,067
Or do they come back without doing it?

765
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:13,544
Indecent!

766
00:56:14,315 --> 00:56:17,235
This is the document of alliance.

767
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,893
<i>[Friday (the 1st day)]</i>

768
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:30,494
<i>[Take a 3 Day 2 Night vacation together.
Venue: a place 3 hours away from Seoul.]</i>

769
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:32,939
Fake schedule.

770
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:35,932
Friday.

771
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,733
10am.

772
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:40,210
Set out.

773
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,576
Destination...

774
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,244
There's the Wando Sunshine Village, right?

775
00:57:00,453 --> 00:57:03,198
Ah, Wando!

776
00:57:10,142 --> 00:57:12,835
Then we must eat some insects.

777
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:29,733
Okay.

778
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,747
We should have a rehearsal first.

779
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:37,237
First, we take the plane,

780
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,224
arrive in Gwangju,

781
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,904
rent a car.

782
00:57:57,634 --> 00:58:00,928
Ah! I don't drive.

783
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:10,964
Why don't you drive?

784
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,232
That is because....

785
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,290
Ah, if it's too long then don't tell me.

786
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:16,225
Let's not quarrel.

787
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,427
Alright.

788
00:58:17,558 --> 00:58:23,229
Ah! This is the 1989 version of Johanne Brahms 4th symphony conducted by Guilini.

789
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,281
- Wow!
- It's a masterpiece.

790
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,942
Can I hold your arm?

791
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:38,804
Yes, if you want.

792
00:58:45,102 --> 00:58:47,821
Come and get me!

793
00:58:50,422 --> 00:58:53,364
Mun Jung, my little greedy.

794
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:56,708
Wow!

795
00:58:56,826 --> 00:59:00,695
All this architecture will be preserved through your hands, is that right?

796
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:14,310
This is so pretty that it's such a pity to eat it.

797
00:59:14,362 --> 00:59:16,417
Then we shall just enjoy looking.

798
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:20,626
We should still eat it.

799
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:31,465
Oh, the wind.

800
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:03,355
<i>[Saturday (the 2nd day)]</i>

801
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:05,957
<i>[Sunday (the 3rd day)]</i>

802
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:17,310
I can't eat flatfish.

803
01:01:18,232 --> 01:01:19,585
Why can't you eat that?

804
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:22,682
I dislike the fishy smell so I don't eat seafood.

805
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:26,577
That's because you haven't had fresh flatfish before.

806
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:29,192
You want me to memorize all this?

807
01:01:29,362 --> 01:01:32,901
Since it's a fake schedule anyway,
we don't have to take it this far, do we?

808
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:35,516
We should just have more photos of us together,

809
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:37,659
that's even more useful, isn't it?

810
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,561
Alright.

811
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:48,855
I went to Wando, saw Jo Jae Hee's construction site and ate seafood,

812
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:51,809
I also saw some romantic landscapes, right?

813
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:52,857
And this....

814
01:01:52,923 --> 01:01:56,583
these are the buildings we saw from the magazines for our trip, right?

815
01:01:56,962 --> 01:02:02,099
From this hilltop if you look down,
you can see the whole village before you.

816
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:05,905
Must I even know the angle at which to look?

817
01:02:06,258 --> 01:02:09,984
If you were really there to see it, it'd be much better.

818
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,435
Is that so?

819
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,489
I'll do the homework.

820
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,454
Don't you hate telling lies?

821
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:26,911
What?

822
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:30,924
Ah, about us faking the trip?

823
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:35,518
Jo Jae Hee, you're good at telling lies, aren't you?

824
01:02:35,897 --> 01:02:37,544
I don't tell lies.

825
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:40,302
Going round and round saying weird things, making people misunderstand,

826
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:42,132
that's a kind of lying too.

827
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,696
If I made things clear for people,

828
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:46,023
they'll say I'm arrogant again or something.

829
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:50,298
Even if you hate it, do go on with this lie.

830
01:02:50,376 --> 01:02:53,513
Your mother's health hinges on it, what else can you do?

831
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,017
We can make it not a lie as well.

832
01:03:00,762 --> 01:03:02,344
Once you tell a lie.....

833
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:09,246
This trip...you want to go for real?

834
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:17,328
Ah, well, if that's what you want.

835
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:19,132
Really.

836
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:23,851
Because you don't want to lie so you want to make the trip for real, does that make sense?

837
01:03:26,668 --> 01:03:29,570
That's not all of it.

838
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:34,812
So?

839
01:03:37,473 --> 01:03:41,343
The trip will come in to add more to Dr Jang's life.

840
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,828
There's no need for you to worry about my life.

841
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,527
Mr. Jo Jae Hee,

842
01:03:54,272 --> 01:03:59,851
no man on earth will ever use such a strange reason, to invite a woman for a trip.

843
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:03,628
And there's not a woman who'd be happy to go on the trip with such a reason.

844
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:10,880
If you have something to say then be frank.

845
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:14,018
If you have nothing else to say then please leave.

846
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:43,250
I'd like to show you.

847
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,929
Show it to you, Dr Jang.

848
01:04:47,524 --> 01:04:48,844
What is it?

849
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:50,862
Seafood.

850
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,620
Some romantic landscapes.

851
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:58,849
The work I do.
