00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:45,379
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

4
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:58,833
Mr. Jo Jae Hee.

5
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:02,167
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, to room number one, please.

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,168
Episode 2
<Privileges of a Bachelor>

7
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,330
Why hasn't he entered yet?

8
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:13,983
There is no need to lie down today.

9
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,795
The last time you wouldn't take
your pants off even if it killed you,

10
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:26,332
now you take them off willingly.

11
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:33,728
Please take a seat.

12
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:40,288
Any sign of bleeding or pain?

13
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:41,822
No.

14
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,124
The operation was a success.

15
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,284
Oh, it has ended?

16
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,991
Yes. Diagnostic and treatment has ended.

17
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,931
I'll take my leave then.

18
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,808
The detailed diagnostic report is
out already.

19
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:58,798
The poly pathology report came back
as benign.

20
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,250
But, if you look over here...

21
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,850
Your cholesterol count is 296,

22
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,787
your LDL is 188,

23
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:09,408
and HDL is 320.

24
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,222
That's is a very high figure
for the fat in your blood.

25
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:13,778
High fat levels?

26
00:03:13,898 --> 00:03:16,898
I'm saying that your cholesterol level
is high. Blood pressure also.

27
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:22,376
If diabetes is considered too, that's the
3 contributing factors to the path of death.

28
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,694
You really like to make things sound worse.
Three contributing factors for death.

29
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,868
Luckily your body weight is normal.

30
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:31,319
Include me being overweight
that's 4 contributing factors, right?

31
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,385
Yes.

32
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,367
Then the 5th contributing factor?

33
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,047
I'm not sure.

34
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,582
Do you want me to tell you?

35
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:41,798
Tell yourself when you go home.

36
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,804
Back to what I was saying.

37
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,289
If your high blood pressure
and cholesterol persists,

38
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,911
it will cause your blood vessels walls
to harden and the heart to clog up.

39
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,403
You have to improve your diet.

40
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,697
Replace meat with fish, abstain from smoking
and alcohol and eat more vegetables, right?

41
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,338
Wow, you know it very well!

42
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,468
Yes.

43
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,367
Just need to follow what you say.

44
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:04,054
I've always wondered.

45
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:08,558
From the perspective of a doctor, seeing
a patient more often will bring in more money.

46
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:11,521
Why give me all these healthy living tips?

47
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,500
It's not even special secret.

48
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,206
There are a lot of patients who ignore
doctors' advices.

49
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:19,720
We are tired of it too.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,510
If you feel like eating then eat.

51
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,000
Do what you feel like doing, living like
that till the end, isn't it good?

52
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,355
And if I die fast...

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,991
Why don't you think about the people around you?

54
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:36,377
Ah, there is no one to feel sad
for you, right?

55
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,244
May I ask, were you born with such
a personality?

56
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:47,637
My mom said that when I was a child,
I was very innocent.

57
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,429
I was so innocent,

58
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,626
that when my mom said drinking milk will
make me taller, I drank 5 liters.

59
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,971
Take good care of your body.

60
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,431
Yes.

61
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:21,062
Mr. Jo Jae Hee's treatments are
finally over.

62
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:22,234
Yes.

63
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,515
It has been hard on you.

64
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:25,709
No kidding.

65
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,394
I still want to bicker with him.

66
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,122
What a pity.

67
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:33,447
Yes. I am most afraid of meeting guys
like him.

68
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,003
I'll learn from this example.

69
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:37,965
Old guys who look good but cannot
be married.

70
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:38,913
Have to be careful of them.

71
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,406
<i>If someone is still single at this age,
there must be some reason.</i>

72
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:46,578
<i>Right?</i>

73
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:48,902
No...

74
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:55,550
You know I'm not referring to you, right?

75
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,302
Suddenly I have such empathy for that guy.

76
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:06,169
Yes, ST hospital.

77
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,258
Yes.

78
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,560
- Please hold on for a while.
- Who is it?

79
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,494
It's your father.

80
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:21,917
Yes, Father?

81
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,964
How heavy are you?

82
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:34,010
Why are you suddenly asking me about
my weight?

83
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,610
Well... how heavy are you?

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,507
52kgs.

85
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,291
Once you start taking high blood pressure
medication,

86
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:42,507
you have to always take it, so be careful.

87
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:48,488
Change your diet and do more exercise.

88
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:53,650
With your clothes, you really look like
a parent.

89
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,312
And when I wear comfortable clothes,

90
00:06:57,313 --> 00:07:00,112
you say I look like a old pregnant woman
who has never drunk seaweed soup.

91
00:06:57,313 --> 00:07:00,112
{\a6}*seaweed soup is given to women after they've birthed their child

92
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:04,202
I'm just doing what I have to do.

93
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,163
I'm able to forget my age as I work.

94
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:09,211
While you, my father lives by counting
your daughter's age.

95
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:12,637
It's because you forget your age that
you can't act your age.

96
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,920
Keep at it, Dad, and we'll end up most
likely distant strangers.

97
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,417
I don't mind if I'm married or not.

98
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:23,473
There are its advantages and disadvantages.

99
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,819
I'm not going for blind dates again.

100
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,123
Don't use your blood pressure to
force me anymore.

101
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,031
You should know as a medical professional,
can I control my own blood pressure?

102
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,736
Aigoo.

103
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:45,466
Forget about the problem regarding me
getting married.

104
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:49,303
Can't we just live in harmony, have a
close father and daughter relationship?

105
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:53,626
Yes, we were like that a few years ago.

106
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,246
Right?

107
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:03,047
We grow old at the speed of light!

108
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,871
Director, we have a patient.

109
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,175
Go back to work.

110
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,715
Let me buy you a meal before I go.

111
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,958
Father, what is this?

112
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,058
Now you're paying for matchmaking services!

113
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,079
There's a patient.

114
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,769
You kids be good, wait there and
don't run about.

115
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,943
Don't worry about us.

116
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:02,319
Ahjumma, you're sitting on my comic.

117
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:06,104
Ahjumma, open you mouth for a while.

118
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,216
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:14,927
Don't just call anyone Ahjumma.

120
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,675
Then what should I call her?

121
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:21,861
Unmarried women get upset when they're
called Ahjumma, stupid.

122
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,635
Well she does look like an ahjumma!

123
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:40,152
Who are you calling Ahjumma?

124
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:44,458
Concept A is the one with the building
specifications you all want.

125
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,701
While concept B is a new design which
we came up with.

126
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,024
We did away with the wall between
the dining room and the kitchen.

127
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:53,711
And put in the another design concept
for the kitchen.

128
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,885
You can decide on what features you want,

129
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:58,784
after you have decided which concept to use.

130
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:01,840
It's very nice!

131
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,781
This is the concept we designed for
the house.

132
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,766
It' spacious and easy to live in.
Other people are also very satisfied with it.

133
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,159
Is this style for concept B?

134
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,524
Yes.

135
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,114
It will be good if it's like that, Hubby.

136
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,670
<i>My sentiments exactly.</i>

137
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,226
But I'm worried about the difference between
how it looks here and how it builds up.

138
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:28,288
We have to calculate if there is a need
to pump in more money.

139
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:05,880
If you decide on concept B, the dining room
and kitchen will look like this.

140
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:11,036
Wow! The atmosphere of the house is
totally changed, Honey!

141
00:11:11,156 --> 00:11:13,233
It's great! its great!

142
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:18,263
Let's look at the design for concept A.

143
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,531
This is the design for concept A.

144
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:43,710
Is that all?

145
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:55,043
This is just a sketch, after your decision,
we'll make more detailed drafts for you.

146
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,264
Here it is.

147
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,389
Please take your time deciding.

148
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,819
- We'll get in touch again.
- Yes.

149
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:06,353
Thank you.

150
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,165
Yes. let me help you.

151
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,901
It's understandable that they're worried.

152
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,052
After all, deciding on a concept that has a
difference of 2 million won isn't easy.

153
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,550
Not an easy decision at all.

154
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,483
Hell definitely go along with
his wife's decision.

155
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,233
They said they will get in touch,
we'll just have to wait and see.

156
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,133
You want to buy insurance?

157
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:32,808
That client earlier is a self employed
insurance agent.

158
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:34,982
I figured I'd take this chance to buy one.

159
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,647
If the both of you want to buy,
just let me know.

160
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,968
I've already bought 4 insurance policies
for cancer.

161
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,823
From the looks of my family medical history,

162
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:46,608
the odds of me dying of cancer is as
high as 87%.

163
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:48,335
I'll definitely get cancer.

164
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:51,600
You really have a lot to boast about!

165
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:57,641
If I'm really diagnosed with cancer, by
selling the house and the cash from the policies,

166
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:03,478
I can buy a yacht and live on the sea,
travelling everywhere for fun.

167
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,303
Are you going to die alone at sea?

168
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:07,505
That's the privilege of being single!

169
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,781
I don't have to live a life with a wife
and child while I'm dying.

170
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,451
Don't have to keep saying that it's
the blessing of God.

171
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:19,124
This is the privilege of enjoying
life to the fullest and dying quietly.

172
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,985
I heard you went to the hospital.
What did they say?

173
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,192
Is your death in sight?

174
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,822
No, they said I'll live a long life.

175
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,457
Your treatment is finished, right?

176
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,089
Director.

177
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,954
How did it feel?

178
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:38,480
For someone who doesn't like to see it
or show it

179
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,251
so much that you won't even go to
the public bath.

180
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:44,914
How did it feel to show that most private
part of your body to,

181
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,914
of all the people in the world,
a female doctor?

182
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:52,028
The doctor who operated on you
was a woman?

183
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,298
Yes, why?

184
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,199
What kind of lady is she?

185
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,466
What do you mean what kind of lady is she?

186
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,830
Pretty?

187
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:08,062
Not even a patient, and yet pale faced,

188
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,165
and oddly enough, not really much make-up...

189
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:17,065
Despite her age, her face looks like
as round as a child's.

190
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,381
Her voice...

191
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:22,759
Yes, very pretty, right?

192
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,008
Does all that mean she's pretty?

193
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:34,973
Let's go for a meal together.

194
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,765
The house has been completed and you are
out of the hospital.

195
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,237
A meal together is good!
What shall we eat?

196
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:42,857
Meat!

197
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:51,249
Ah! Telephone.

198
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,789
What?

199
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:06,434
Dr. Jang just showed me your
blood test report.

200
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:09,482
It looks very serious.

201
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:11,417
Why are you passing that around?

202
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,585
Why don't you come have dinner at my place?

203
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,350
I'll feed you something that really
nourishes your body.

204
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,972
Will eating one meal have any effect?

205
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:25,763
No. You have to take care of
your own body.

206
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,753
Without a wife to take care of you,
you treat yourself too badly.

207
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:35,207
At our age if we don't take care and
don't exercise, we'll be in big trouble!

208
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:39,463
I regret to say I have a dinner gathering
tonight.

209
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:45,587
Top quality grilled beef!

210
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:48,549
Delicious animal fat texture and oil.

211
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,918
Maybe I'll absorb even more fat into
my bloodstream!

212
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:56,493
Well then, good work.

213
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,126
Gosh, this rascal, really.

214
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,633
Come in.

215
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,448
Did you warn Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

216
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,231
If he eats meat again, he'll get
another illness.

217
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,659
Yes, I did tell him.

218
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,453
But since he was young, that rascal
just refuses to listen.

219
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,288
Good work!

220
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:26,968
My friend, not everybody can do that.

221
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:34,622
This was definitely thought of
in a blink of the eye.

222
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,455
How?

223
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:41,552
Your director is a special person who has
received the prestigious building award twice.

224
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,385
How can you forget that?

225
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,902
Are we getting off work?

226
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,132
Aren't we having dinner together?

227
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,460
We are having dinner together today?

228
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:03,040
I have an appointment.

229
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,908
Hey, I've gotten hyped up for high quality
grilled beef for our dinner tonight!

230
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:08,944
Why are you crashing my hopes?

231
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,829
We finally agreed on eating beef!

232
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,683
How long...

233
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,398
Why didn't you say so earlier?

234
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,684
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,370
It's a high school friends' reunion.

236
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:27,984
Then, forget about me. You two go ahead.

237
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:34,059
Shall we?

238
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,233
I can't make it today neither.

239
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:42,242
I have to see the building authority
officials.

240
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:47,818
Forget it.

241
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,721
Goodbye.

242
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,419
He's already 40, and he's getting angry
over things like a dinner gathering.

243
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:04,069
How can you blame me for forgetting?
He doesn't even look like he's an architect!

244
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:08,140
When a person gets old,
they get angry over small things.

245
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:12,211
Do you think I have such weird moments too?

246
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:15,655
The last time when you were on a diet.

247
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,211
A little.

248
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,853
Right. Didn't you have a reunion
last time?

249
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,389
Why do you meet up so often?

250
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,139
You were lying earlier, weren't you?

251
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:38,346
What you're saying is usually said to
your husband.

252
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:42,459
Director and you have to get married quickly.

253
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:45,547
No matter how famous of a designer you are,
how can you be like this?

254
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,537
Eating this everyday. Having biscuits,

255
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,244
That's why you are grumbling.

256
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,966
You mouth should be in tune with
your love life!

257
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:59,471
Besides eating, it is a very useful
feature of the body.

258
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,561
One look and I know it's not a reunion.
It's probably a date with a girl.

259
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:05,819
These lips, I wish you good luck
with and have a pleasant evening.

260
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:06,779
I'm leaving!

261
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:12,231
What an office, none of them have
a personal life.

262
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,702
These lonely souls, really...

263
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,726
<i>Welcome!</i>

264
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,325
Yu Jin.

265
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,781
I didn't think you'd call.
Gave me a shock.

266
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,385
Didn't we agree to call if we thought
of each other?

267
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:44,304
Even so, I heard that you were back on
good terms with your boyfriend.

268
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,818
That's why I didn't raise my hopes.

269
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,631
What? Who said that?

270
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,935
My director.

271
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,549
That guy called Sanggu always goes
to your place.

272
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,509
Sanggu?

273
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:05,343
This is Sanggu.

274
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,061
A dog?

275
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,824
Ah, that man really.

276
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:19,946
I've got to warn that neighbor,
saying all these weird things.

277
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:20,516
He's definitely not a bad guy.

278
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,769
Just one with a unique way of communicating.

279
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:25,333
Yes.

280
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,860
You haven't had dinner right?
Let's go and eat.

281
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,231
OK.

282
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,265
Italian? Is that alright?

283
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,058
Yeah, that'll be good.

284
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:45,674
Why did you hit me?

285
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:50,007
This is really spicy.

286
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,895
Is this place really nice to eat?

287
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:01,352
It's very delicious!

288
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,898
Do you want to order?

289
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,434
I want the fried chicken.

290
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,484
Wait a minute.

291
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:12,998
- The seafood special is discounted by 300won?
- Yes.

292
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,589
- I want that then.
- Yes.

293
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,401
- I can use my coupon, right?
- Yes.

294
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,628
The 50% discount one.

295
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,676
You're not ordering?

296
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,948
I'd like a carbonara.

297
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,025
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

298
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,548
I'll use the 70% discount one then.

299
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,146
<i>Yes.</i>

300
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:54,886
Uncle!

301
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:56,817
What?

302
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,569
Who is that?

303
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:10,852
Without this, it'd be more spacious and
welcoming... who's the designer?

304
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:13,736
Oppa, don't pick at things and take a seat.

305
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:16,977
What's with the floor?

306
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:21,921
Where is the cucumber dish?

307
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:22,736
<i>I'll find it.</i>

308
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:29,112
So happy that Oppa came?
Want to feed him everything?

309
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:33,212
Didn't you say that you had dinner plans?

310
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:35,258
Oh...

311
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,314
It's nice to come over to eat once
in a while.

312
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,602
How long has it been since we ate together?

313
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:43,271
You say it as if you're the host.

314
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:45,614
This person, comes very often?

315
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,037
This, you

316
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,811
It's him who allows her to come very often.

317
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,257
Yes. Come more often.

318
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,412
You live so near after all.

319
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,027
Didn't you say that you had dinner plans?

320
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,412
My husband is better than Oppa, right, Mom?

321
00:22:58,832 --> 00:22:59,886
Need you even say?

322
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:04,466
It's such a surprise that you came to eat
with us, Uncle.

323
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:08,693
Ye Won, don't drop your rice.

324
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,836
Uncle is the type of person who gets
a stomachache

325
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:13,236
if he sees someone drop things
while eating.

326
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,116
Really?

327
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:15,684
Yes really.

328
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:19,441
I'm really sorry I gave birth to such a
strange child, Ye Won.

329
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:21,712
What is this?

330
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,913
Mushroom rice.

331
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:27,855
My in-laws all have diabetes. He and Ye Won
need to watch what they are eating.

332
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,900
Oppa, you have high fat cholesterol in
your blood, right?

333
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,012
Then you have to eat mushrooms, onions...

334
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:40,868
No, when you are leaving later,
I'll write it all down for you.

335
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:43,019
- Fernbrake, Chinese bellflower, spinach, sea algae.
- That's enough.

336
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,769
Is he not eating right because he doesn't know?
There's nothing he doesn't know in this world.

337
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,645
He needs a wife.

338
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:53,261
Men need to be forced to eat right.
Otherwise, they won't take care of themselves.

339
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:58,031
Dear, what about Dr. Jang Mun Jung?

340
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,043
What about her?

341
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:01,641
To be his wife?

342
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:06,857
Of all the illnesses in the world, they met
because of his hemorrhoids.

343
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,331
<i>It's not very nice.</i>

344
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,361
What? Who? Doctor who?

345
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,009
Dr. Jang Mun Jung, Grandma.

346
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,345
The doctor in charge of treating him.

347
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:19,078
She looks good and I've got a good
impression of her.

348
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:22,111
Wait a minute.
How old is that doctor?

349
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:23,577
How does she look like?

350
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:25,243
Wait a minute.

351
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:33,464
Where?

352
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,463
<i>Here she is, Jang Mun Jung.</i>

353
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,440
What's there to see?

354
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,490
Give it to me, hurry give it to me.

355
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,001
Really. Give it to me!

356
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:43,493
Really.

357
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:49,866
You're still here?

358
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:50,889
Yes.

359
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,958
I still got things to do.
You're not getting off work?

360
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,616
I'll leave when I'm finished with this.

361
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,474
Eun Hee, do you want to go eat
grilled meat together?

362
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,881
Grilled meat?

363
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:09,204
I've been craving meat these past few days.

364
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,446
I've been eating so many flour-based
dinners lately,

365
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,946
it's about time to eat a stamina
replenishing meal.

366
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,822
If you don't have an appointment,
let's go together.

367
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:20,102
OK. I'll change and be right back.

368
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:22,282
OK, see you in 10 minutes by the front desk.

369
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:25,393
- I'll finish this up and come out.
- Yes.

370
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,438
Meat?

371
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,988
Didn't you just have ddukbokki
with me earlier?

372
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:35,972
I couldn't say that I had eaten already.

373
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:39,340
I missed the opportunity to say
that I've eaten.

374
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,237
<i>It's always like that.</i>

375
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:44,964
<i>She always eats alone everyday,
so we can't refuse.</i>

376
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,223
Accompany her occasionally.

377
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:52,221
Every time she gets off work, she always try
to catch someone to have dinner with her.

378
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:54,089
I feel bad seeing her like that.

379
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,350
Gave me a shock.

380
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,993
I thought it was Dr. Jang Mun Jung.

381
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:20,587
Eun Hee, what should I do?
I suddenly have something urgent to do.

382
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,477
We'll eat together next time. I'm sorry.

383
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:26,899
It's okay. You go ahead then. I'll have a chat with
Tae Young and then go home.

384
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,774
Sorry. Good work!

385
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:29,862
Sorry!

386
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,247
Goodbye!

387
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:11,257
I'm already 26 years old.

388
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,303
Having a first date at a place full of
high school kids.

389
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,093
That's too much.

390
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:19,965
But the worse is the use of the
discount vouchers!

391
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:23,460
Even worse, they were cut out from a magazine!

392
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:27,020
Coupons? That's a foul!

393
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,343
He's not a high school kid anymore.

394
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:32,479
There are some lines that must be honored.

395
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,355
<i>How is he like?</i>

396
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:38,192
He's not bad.
Very humorous and capable.

397
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:42,054
Very knowledgeable about food,
music and arts.

398
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:46,722
If you can connect with him, then see
him once more.

399
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:48,555
I don't know.

400
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:52,215
I wanted someone to warm my heart with
some love.

401
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:55,327
He just makes me frustrated.

402
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:02,053
Yes. He's been working in a building
company for a year already.

403
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,696
<i>Does he get paid a lot?</i>

404
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:11,240
I don't know about that.
but that director is a bit

405
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:15,466
Yes. Haven't you seen him before?

406
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:23,664
What happened? Something's wrong?

407
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:28,332
Nothing, I'll call you later.

408
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,193
Hello.

409
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:48,182
Are you feeling better?

410
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:51,102
Why?

411
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:55,808
Nothing. It's just there was nothing
to say, that's why.

412
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:01,392
If there's nothing to say, then you
shouldn't say anything.

413
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:03,525
I see.

414
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:23,029
What's wrong with him.?

415
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:27,341
We are neighbors, that's why I
greeted him, right?

416
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,662
How did your date go?

417
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:54,021
It cannot be considered a date.

418
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,279
How did you know?

419
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,470
I know you like the back of my hand.

420
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:07,350
Well, it was okay.

421
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:11,024
Hm, high school reunion?

422
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:13,588
That...

423
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,929
What did you eat last night?

424
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:18,681
If you used discount coupons, then it's over.

425
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:21,886
Do a model for this.

426
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,124
What do you mean by that?

427
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:26,042
What did Yu Jin say?

428
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:29,475
That she doesn't want to meet a high school
student like you again.

429
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:33,277
She's funny.

430
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:35,707
- She was the one that contacted me first.
- And also...

431
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:40,115
Don't use the knowledge I taught you
as your own.

432
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,052
When did I do that?

433
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:43,642
What did she say exactly?

434
00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:46,601
They have decided.

435
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,512
How did it go?

436
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:52,816
It was as you said, his wife won
and decided on concept B.

437
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,127
Let's get started on the design.

438
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,528
What is this?

439
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,432
You're already done?

440
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:10,841
Still have to make the model.

441
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,311
The design...

442
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:20,408
What if they had chosen the other one,
what would you do?

443
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:25,613
How about dinner together tonight?

444
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:27,466
Let's do just that.

445
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,798
Sorry, I have an appointment tonight.

446
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:32,222
You two go ahead.

447
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,502
Let's just all agree on a date and
go together.

448
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:35,949
Is that okay?

449
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,566
Grilled beef is only good when there
are many people.

450
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,487
I'll do that then. Give it to me.

451
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:48,344
Hey, you know how I always eat
meals by myself?

452
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:50,909
But I cannot go to a grill restaurant
by myself.

453
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,374
But for some reason, I can't seem to go
to a grill restaurant by myself.

454
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,379
<i>You can never go alone to places where
you have to grill or cook.</i>

455
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,937
<i>Yes. Fine dining restaurants too!</i>

456
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,324
A group of strange people.

457
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:14,927
Welcome!

458
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,869
Table for six?

459
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,702
I'm alone.

460
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,662
Follow me, please.

461
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,696
Are you ready to order now?

462
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:38,012
Yes.

463
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:43,703
Can I have half of this and
this to make a serving for one?

464
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:45,701
Eh?

465
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,740
Don't worry about it.

466
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,266
First of all,

467
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:54,240
First, Yukhoe (seasoned raw beef) for one,

468
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,565
Premium Saeng Deungshim (Scotch fillet)
for one,

469
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:03,323
Premium Got Deungshim (prime rib fillet)
for one, and a bottle of red wine.

470
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,742
We'll prepare it right now.

471
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,363
<i>What do you feel like eating, Oppa?</i>

472
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:12,901
<i>Before looking for something to eat
and drink,</i>

473
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:16,674
<i>it's more important to look for someone to eat
and drink with.</i>

474
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:23,132
For dining alone is leading the life
of a lion or wolf.

475
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:25,604
Those are the words of Alain de Botton.

476
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,212
It's one of my favorite quotes.

477
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:33,819
Those are Epicurus' words, Alain de Botton
merely borrowed it.

478
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,057
Ignoramus.

479
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,258
Welcome!

480
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:49,566
Please give me a bowl of
Haemul Kalguksu (Seafood noodle).

481
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,224
Please serve the food over here.

482
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:26,858
<i>Yes.</i>

483
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,853
I can tell it's your first time.

484
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:31,025
Huh?

485
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:34,213
You feel embarrassed eating alone
in the restaurant, don't you?

486
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,705
Is it that obvious?

487
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:38,476
And I was trying to act nonchalant.

488
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:44,156
Hiding in a corner reading a book and
listening to music, pretending to look busy.

489
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:48,696
I don't know where to focus my eyes on
if I haven't got a book.

490
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:51,701
But you seem to behave very differently,
Doctor.

491
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:54,094
Of course, I've done it for many years.

492
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:56,340
Hang on a minute.

493
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,392
Ahjummonim,
is it okay if I switch the TV channel?

494
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,238
Drama time.

495
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,894
Wow, fabulous!

496
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,388
Oh! This little feeling of superiority!

497
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,160
Doctor, shall we order
a Bindaeduk (Mung bean pancake)?

498
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,503
Alright!

499
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:17,372
Can we have a Bindaeduk...
and a bottle of beer, please?

500
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,566
<i>Yes.</i>

501
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:20,846
Do you normally dine out?

502
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:24,059
When I first became independent,
I tried cooking for myself.

503
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,773
It was a very short time frame,
and I really put my heart into it.

504
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:31,808
But I got sick of it afterwards, and
realized that restaurant food is still the best!

505
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:33,811
I still think so.

506
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,104
Me too?

507
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,160
Thank you.

508
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:03,441
Let's ditch the polite terms.

509
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,448
May I do so...? Can I?

510
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,740
Have I been watching too much TV?

511
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,177
On TV, doctors are always running around
in their lab coats,

512
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:26,177
and fighting death with heart patients.

513
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:27,648
But you're not like that at all.

514
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:31,745
You go to internet cafe, and you're
watching daily dramas in places like this.

515
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:37,948
Why must my private life be exposed
in this kind of place?

516
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:40,957
Ah! I haven't been to the
internet cafe since that day.

517
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,257
Why not?

518
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:47,223
Well, I'm bored and have nothing to do,
and those games are a form of stress relief.

519
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,356
But the players I meet in the game

520
00:37:49,357 --> 00:37:53,056
always ask me how old I am,
and what I do for a living...

521
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:56,274
Instead of a stress relief, it's becoming
another form of stress for me.

522
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:05,114
Looks like you've gotten over the break-up.

523
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,119
Yes, I'm over it.

524
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,406
Anyway, he and I are like a vehicle
running out of fuel.

525
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:17,366
You mean the love is not there anymore?

526
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:21,317
Yes. What about you, Doctor?

527
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,051
You haven't dated for a long time, right?

528
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,443
Can you sense it from me?

529
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,470
A little.

530
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,994
How long ago has it been?

531
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:49,983
Oh, you are my woman...

532
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:52,278
"You're Lovable" by Kim Jong Kook?

533
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:53,344
That's it!

534
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:58,310
Wow I was listening to that song when
I went home after my break-up.

535
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:02,530
It was very popular at the time.

536
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,037
You haven't dated since then?

537
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,596
Wow, how long ago was that?

538
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,887
I was in college then.

539
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,150
Those college students are now in
the workforce.

540
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:19,851
The singer who sang that song has finished
his military service

541
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:22,351
and is now back in the entertainment
industry.

542
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:25,441
It seems that time has only stopped for me.

543
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:30,096
Cheers?

544
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,761
Cheers!

545
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,799
Cervical cancer vaccination...
it's good to immunize yourself.

546
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:14,593
They said it's better to get immunized
when you're younger.

547
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:18,213
We have a gynecology department at the hospital,
so come and do it when you have the time.

548
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,771
Yes, I can just go to you, Doctor!

549
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:23,034
Even though I haven't done anything wrong,

550
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:26,334
I feel embarrassed going to the
gynecologist near my place.

551
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:28,764
Should I get an ultrasound too?

552
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,791
I haven't had a check-up for a few years.

553
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,341
Does he have to make the meal look like
such a serious affair?

554
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:54,751
He looks like a priest who's about
to eat a bible.

555
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:58,311
But is that Ahjussi eating by himself?

556
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:03,485
It can't be. His partner must have gone
to the toilet.

557
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:07,684
He's alone!

558
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:09,346
He is alone indeed.

559
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,292
Doctor, do you eat meat by yourself too?

560
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:13,103
I've not done that in a restaurant before.

561
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,959
Not everyone can achieve that.

562
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,939
He's occupying a four-seat table by himself!

563
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,394
They're changing another grilling plate.

564
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,729
He hasn't had enough yet.

565
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:29,994
I warned him to cut down on his meat intake.

566
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:33,304
You can tell that he's
the type who doesn't heed advice.

567
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:36,672
Let's go.

568
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:41,126
Wine! Doctor, he even ordered wine.

569
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,193
High school kid?

570
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,963
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

571
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,798
<i>Since when was I talking behind your back?</i>

572
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:14,663
High school kid?

573
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,368
What high school kid?

574
00:42:16,488 --> 00:42:19,203
I have never said that!

575
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:22,635
I told you I haven't said it.

576
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,353
Fine, so what if I have?

577
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:26,556
What's wrong with calling you
a high school kid when you're one?

578
00:42:26,676 --> 00:42:28,850
What? Are you an elementary student?

579
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:55,292
Director.

580
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,617
I still think it's really weird.

581
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,559
Did Yu Jin really call me a
high school kid?

582
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,080
What are you talking about?

583
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:06,706
What? You told me so yesterday!

584
00:43:06,826 --> 00:43:09,200
Do you know how ridiculous
I thought it was and how mad I was?

585
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,589
I wanted to thrash it out with her over
the phone but I ended up sounding like a nutcase.

586
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:15,381
You should be responsible for the
trouble you caused.

587
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:27,056
What are you doing?

588
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:33,088
I should do some exercising after
eating all that meat.

589
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:38,328
Director!

590
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:40,651
Why did you have to do it here
by the lumber?

591
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:55,258
Thank you.

592
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:00,045
<i>How's your menstrual cycle?</i>

593
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:07,241
Last year the cycle was 28 days,
but this year I've only had it 4 times.

594
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,054
But why have you only come for a
check-up now?

595
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:14,467
Isn't it just a hormone imbalance?
Haven't I reached that age now?

596
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:16,127
Your problem is that
you think you know everything.

597
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:21,519
You didn't have a sex life in the
past few years, did you?

598
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,501
Even though this is a very common
question to be asked by the gynecologist,

599
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,952
why do I feel like this is an invasion
of my privacy?

600
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:30,935
It does encompass a certain
amount of my own curiosity.

601
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:34,394
How can you live like this?

602
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:39,692
If you don't want to get married, at least
find someone to have a relationship.

603
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:42,985
If it's so easy to have a relationship,
I'd have been married a long time ago.

604
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:48,130
Looks like a cyst.

605
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:49,166
What?

606
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:53,433
<i>From the position and size, it shouldn't
look like it's anything to worry about,</i>

607
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:57,994
but there seem to be a muscle imbalance here.

608
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:01,864
This means that we need to consider
the possibility that it may be malignant.

609
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:06,681
<i>We'll do a CT and a biopsy on you.</i>

610
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,001
When will the results be out?

611
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:16,451
In 2 weeks.

612
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,427
You'll be fine, right?

613
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:20,727
Did you get a shock?

614
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:24,436
Didn't you get a shock, doctor? How can
you behave like nothing has happened?

615
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:27,286
That's because you're worrying
about me like it's happening to yourself,

616
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,119
so it makes me feel like
there's nothing to worry about.

617
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:32,082
Of course I'm worried,
I'm a woman too.

618
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:34,788
It still feels really strange,
no matter what.

619
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:36,856
Thanks.

620
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:39,974
Actually I'm a little scared.

621
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:44,073
I have not even had children yet,
but this part is already getting rusty.

622
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:46,929
It doesn't make me feel good.

623
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,826
I'll be going now.

624
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,398
- Take care.
- Alright.

625
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:54,639
Doctor, thanks for keeping me company today.

626
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:58,284
Me too. I'm thankful that I get to do a
check-up because of you, Yu Jin.

627
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:00,290
- I'm going now.
- Go.

628
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,292
Alright.

629
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,928
What happened?

630
00:46:23,932 --> 00:46:25,701
Workplace accident.

631
00:46:27,108 --> 00:46:30,220
You're really fated to be at the hospital.

632
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,698
It's not a fracture, is it?

633
00:46:33,146 --> 00:46:35,512
Sorry, I took too long on the phone.

634
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:46,980
Ah! This is... that person?

635
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:52,245
That person?

636
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:59,180
This guy here has given you a lot of
trouble, hasn't he?

637
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,610
N... No.

638
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:08,009
<i>I'm Yun Ki Ran.</i>

639
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,693
<i>I'm Jang Mun Jung.</i>

640
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:11,313
<i>Mr. Jo Jae Hee!</i>

641
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,184
I'll do it.

642
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:25,534
I'll settle the account for you,
just sit here.

643
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,462
Why?

644
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:34,648
You do have.

645
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,586
What?

646
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:36,623
A person like her.

647
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,488
What kind of person?

648
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:44,047
Done, let's go.

649
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,568
Why are you here?

650
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:23,573
What other scores do you have to
settle with me?

651
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:27,818
Firstly, Id like to apologize for what
I said over the phone last night.

652
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,610
Well, forget it.

653
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:34,979
You really didn't say anything
to the Director, right?

654
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,537
I told you I haven't!

655
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:42,149
Don't tell me he was pulling my legs?

656
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,284
To tell the truth, the coupons were
a bit lame.

657
00:48:46,817 --> 00:48:50,517
Of course I know you're young and
don't earn much,

658
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,245
and the economy isn't very strong right now,
so it's good to be frugal.

659
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:58,643
But from my point of view,
to dine in that manner during a first date,

660
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:02,011
makes me feel like I'm a cheap date.

661
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:04,976
It makes me feel like the type of woman

662
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:08,576
who can be wooed by 30% coupons
and cheap utensils.

663
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,607
Is that really what you mean?!

664
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,100
I'm trying to convince myself
that this may be what you're feeling.

665
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:23,813
Nevertheless, the spaghetti was pretty good.

666
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:27,124
Yes! I really wanted you to try
the spaghetti!

667
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:31,131
It's funny not to use the coupon when
I have it in my wallet.

668
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,327
I see...

669
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:37,208
Yu Jin, the manager is looking for you.

670
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:40,795
I have to go. See you.

671
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,111
I'll call you again!

672
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:48,391
Hurry up and go in!

673
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:50,335
He's really cute!

674
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,656
What cute?!

675
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:57,878
Have I not told you to make a copy
of the results and send it off on time?

676
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,312
Go make a copy and send it off.

677
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,462
Yes.

678
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:14,917
The doctor has been in a bad mood
since just now.

679
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,697
I don't know why either.

680
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:41,236
Yes, Yu Jin?

681
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:45,307
Doctor, shall we have dinner together
if you don't have an appointment today?

682
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:47,753
Shall we?

683
00:50:47,873 --> 00:50:48,733
Yes.

684
00:50:48,853 --> 00:50:51,419
I'll make you something delicious.

685
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:53,678
Alright.

686
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:02,593
If you can't use your arms,
why do you bother buying so many things?

687
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:04,467
You can walk a little slower too!

688
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:10,804
Here, here.

689
00:51:18,714 --> 00:51:22,465
You should offer me some
money to buy a meal for my effort.

690
00:51:22,585 --> 00:51:25,500
If I do that, I'll be insulting the word
"volunteer".

691
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,821
Go, go!

692
00:51:26,941 --> 00:51:28,910
Damn, I'm really hungry!

693
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,148
It's really beautiful!

694
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,535
This is Dr Jang Mun Jung from ST Hospital.

695
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:49,368
And this is Park Hyun Kyu.

696
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:51,542
Ah, so this is that person!

697
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:57,037
Yes, it looks like I am that person.

698
00:51:58,764 --> 00:52:00,235
But why are you here?

699
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:03,687
I invited her to my house for dinner.

700
00:52:04,716 --> 00:52:06,528
It must be good!

701
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:09,768
I haven't had dinner because
I've been busy till now.

702
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,674
Care to join us for dinner?

703
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,292
Can I really?

704
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,110
Are you okay with it?

705
00:52:15,494 --> 00:52:19,190
No problem, it'll be good to have
dinner together.

706
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,241
Come over then.

707
00:52:23,413 --> 00:52:25,864
See you then! I'm going with them.

708
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:34,133
See you.

709
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,116
<i>Sanggu!</i>

710
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:42,332
Tada!

711
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,783
Oh my, how did you do it?

712
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:51,341
- It looks delicious!
- Surprise, surprise! It looks really delicious!

713
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,344
Doctor, I am a woman who can cook.

714
00:53:58,517 --> 00:53:59,881
Wow, can I have a try?

715
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,416
Where did you learn how to do this?

716
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:04,656
When you live by yourself,
you'll eventually learn how to do it.

717
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:06,532
Then what about me?

718
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,431
Please go ahead.

719
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:11,754
It's delicious.

720
00:54:52,888 --> 00:54:55,233
That girl went to France,
and I went to Spain.

721
00:54:55,353 --> 00:54:57,594
We went our separate ways
without exchanging our address.

722
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:58,596
Why?

723
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:00,844
She said we were strangers before,
so we should part as strangers too.

724
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,613
So I told her it's up to her.

725
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:04,422
Are you lying?

726
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:08,010
It sounds like a drama script
about passion and rationale.

727
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,634
This is really the story of my first love!

728
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:13,296
Listen to me first,

729
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:16,877
I met the girl again after almost a year,

730
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:19,341
in a club at Itaewon.

731
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:21,515
- And so?
- Did she get booked?

732
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,137
Doctor.

733
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:26,098
Haven't you been to a club?

734
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,554
Isn't it like a nightclub?

735
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:30,762
You really don't know?

736
00:55:31,486 --> 00:55:33,731
Doctor, shall we go clubbing?

737
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:35,053
Me too, me too!

738
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:38,037
So what happened? What happened?

739
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:40,659
You have no idea how fast my heart
was beating.

740
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:43,430
I ditched my friends and
dragged her out of that place.

741
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,226
<i>All I was thinking was
that I shouldn't let her go.</i>

742
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:48,103
<i>I couldn't see nor hear any of my friends.</i>

743
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:05,602
Yes?

744
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:09,226
Hey, hey, take a look at HBS now.

745
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:10,867
Why?

746
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:16,965
There's a seal couple at play,
this is really interesting.

747
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:18,031
Really?

748
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:20,013
<i>I said watch it now!</i>

749
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:22,315
Alright, alright...

750
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:24,596
I'll do it now.

751
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:28,951
How come they can even play like that?

752
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:37,745
Those guys are really jokers.

753
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:40,815
<i>Even seals can find companions
and lead such an interesting life.</i>

754
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:43,777
Don't you feel anything at all?

755
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:45,802
No.

756
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,508
I'm hanging up!

757
00:56:57,463 --> 00:57:01,492
Hey, you should let me do this.
I'm not just getting my meal for nothing.

758
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:02,664
Alright.

759
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,694
Wait, why have you stopped using the
polite terms with me?

760
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:11,164
We're the same age anyway,
so there's no need to.

761
00:57:13,018 --> 00:57:16,642
I don't know when was the
last time I had such a great meal.

762
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:22,046
Food really ought to be shared
for it to be enjoyable, don't you think?

763
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,402
True!

764
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,026
Isn't there someone who said that
he would rather eat alone?

765
00:57:27,146 --> 00:57:28,539
Over there.

766
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:33,786
Who likes to eat by themselves?

767
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,005
His girlfriend should be here to
look after him, right?

768
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,072
Now that he's injured his hand.

769
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:42,099
He has a girlfriend? Who?

770
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:45,935
A very good-looking lady.
She was with him at the hospital just now.

771
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,642
Manager Yun?

772
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:50,733
She's just a colleague.

773
00:57:50,853 --> 00:57:53,184
I was wondering who you're talking about.

774
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,827
Is that so?

775
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:04,654
He's at it again.

776
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,246
Yes?

777
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:28,336
Don't you think that's a little too loud?

778
00:58:28,741 --> 00:58:30,893
Your laughter is even louder.

779
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,344
Have you had dinner?

780
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:36,392
If not, someone said you can have it here.

781
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:40,911
You have leftovers, right?

782
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,281
You want me to pick up your leftovers?

783
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:46,414
Aigoo, you don't have to say it's leftovers.

784
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:49,099
These are leftovers indeed.

785
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:54,124
She said they are leftovers.

786
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:05,037
The point when you fall in love

787
00:59:06,465 --> 00:59:08,661
is when you discover something beyond
the facade.

788
00:59:08,781 --> 00:59:11,879
It's like beyond the cold and
calculated front.

789
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:16,535
Ah, this man has a side that's filled
with warmth.

790
00:59:17,025 --> 00:59:19,817
That's the jerk complex.

791
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:24,716
TV is a media that seems to have
a worse effect on women than children.

792
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:28,475
We're not merely talking about dramas,
women really feel that way, right?

793
00:59:28,595 --> 00:59:29,767
That's right.

794
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:34,009
You can see the weakness that others
cannot see.

795
00:59:34,129 --> 00:59:36,654
The feeling that made you really want
to embrace him...

796
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,617
The man cannot live without me.

797
00:59:51,276 --> 00:59:53,749
You want to eat this?

798
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:02,659
Looks like he's enjoying it.

799
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:05,323
He must be really hungry.

800
01:00:05,443 --> 01:00:09,586
Don't keep eating meat, have some
vegetables too.

801
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,291
Yes, yes.

802
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:16,034
Don't worry about me over here,
just continue with your love story.

803
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:20,275
Director, are you really not interested
in getting married?

804
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:21,810
Not in the least.

805
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:25,662
Have you ever worried about it?

806
01:00:26,173 --> 01:00:30,351
The sense of unease of growing old alone
without family and kids.

807
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:35,428
The reason why you feel uneasy about
not getting married,

808
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,454
is because you see marriage
as your ultimate life goal.

809
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:43,466
And because you still harbor the feeling
that you haven't reached your goal,

810
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:47,090
you feel uneasy about your life,
or you've developed anxiety about it.

811
01:00:47,622 --> 01:00:53,015
You just have to change your thinking
a little, you can do it all by yourself.

812
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,830
You do have a point there.

813
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,078
Rascal, don't you feel tired doing that?

814
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,192
- What about you, Doctor?
- Me?

815
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,360
I really don't have the confidence
that I can do it by myself,

816
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,024
so I still hope to find a good man.

817
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:32,413
Of course you must. I'll help you find one.

818
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:36,660
A man who can drag you out of that garage.

819
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,731
Garage? What's that?

820
01:01:41,754 --> 01:01:45,974
There was a fiancé, but they broke up
because of some issues.

821
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:53,860
<i>If we use a car as an analogy, then it's like
entering a garage and being shut in</i>

822
01:01:55,566 --> 01:02:00,159
<i>without ever experiencing life outside.</i>

823
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,823
Can I tell the story?

824
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:06,384
There's nothing you can't tell,
it's all in the past anyway.

825
01:02:06,504 --> 01:02:10,519
In those youthful days, if one doesn't
leave any memories behind,

826
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,352
that would be really weird, wouldn't it?

827
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:13,376
Isn't it?

828
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,402
If that's the case, it would be really sad.

829
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:19,762
Little vixen, get lost.

830
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:21,702
Go, go!

831
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:26,604
Doctor, shall I start the engine?

832
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,883
Huh?

833
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:31,000
The car that's been left in the garage
for a long time...

834
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,683
Shall I start it?

835
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:34,589
Dating!

836
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:37,841
Give us a list.

837
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:39,674
Do you want to do it?

838
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:45,951
Well then, from now on,
I shall unlock my heart and give it a go!

839
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:49,873
I wonder if that rusty car still works.

840
01:02:53,962 --> 01:02:55,252
Did you say rusty?

841
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:58,588
Aren't you almost 40?

842
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:06,643
What right do you have to discuss my age?

843
01:03:07,629 --> 01:03:10,243
Who told you to describe yourself as a car?

844
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:14,611
When a woman is almost 40,

845
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:20,283
does that mean she ought to be branded
as a rusty car?

846
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,319
At least it wouldn't rot,
because it's made of metal.

847
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:30,585
Ahjussi!

848
01:03:34,956 --> 01:03:36,394
How can you...

849
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:39,665
how can you be like this?

850
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:46,673
I'm neither rusty nor rotting.

851
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:55,029
Sorry, I have to go.

852
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:56,402
Doctor.

853
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:58,427
Seriously!

854
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:03,557
Doctor!

855
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:08,350
Hurry up and apologize!

856
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,479
Excuse me.

857
01:04:19,497 --> 01:04:20,712
Um...

858
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:27,093
You look much younger than your actual age.

859
01:04:32,976 --> 01:04:34,489
Are you having fun?

860
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,351
No.

861
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,444
Wow, seriously!

862
01:04:45,564 --> 01:04:47,341
Ahjussi, what's wrong with you?!

863
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:49,302
You call that a joke?!

864
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,313
Hurry up and go have a look!

865
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:02,950
Doctor...

866
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,634
What should I do?

867
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,090
Hurry up!

868
01:05:19,653 --> 01:05:22,040
Director, you're really!
You made a woman cry.

869
01:05:28,836 --> 01:05:30,498
What an embarrassment.

870
01:05:31,692 --> 01:05:33,887
What's so embarrassing about it?

871
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:36,999
Sorry, just go in.

872
01:05:39,545 --> 01:05:43,999
Doctor, shall we take this opportunity
to relieve our stress?

873
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:04,468
How can you keep on drinking like this?

874
01:06:04,588 --> 01:06:09,534
I'm really not used to rubbing
my shoulders and back against other men.

875
01:06:09,654 --> 01:06:11,967
That's because you're still sober.

876
01:06:12,087 --> 01:06:14,205
Now start finding your target.

877
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:16,797
Is it alcohol? Hobby? Or men?

878
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:22,550
First of all, let's start by drinking
enough alcohol,

879
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,001
then let's hook some men with our dance.

880
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,601
Oh! Your ultimate target is the men!

881
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:30,201
Haven't I been told that I'm already rusty?

882
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:33,207
I'd like to find out just how rusty I am!

883
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:36,538
Okay! Let me get us some more drinks.

888
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:21,784
So you're saying that you've
always joke around a lot,

889
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,998
and haven't done anything wrong.

890
01:07:24,118 --> 01:07:26,388
The overseas auction will start at
5 o'clock.

891
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:28,152
That's something which you can't do
by yourself.

892
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:28,855
Really?

893
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:30,517
Do you know each other?

894
01:07:30,637 --> 01:07:33,097
Is that person a regular customer too?

895
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:38,524
Do you always sing by yourself?

896
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:39,547
I think it's the same this time.

897
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,415
That's right, it's also a hangover
this time.

898
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,596
What if it's something that's even
more serious?

899
01:07:43,716 --> 01:07:46,012
We'll know after the blood test.

900
01:07:46,132 --> 01:07:48,804
I must be crazy, why did I get onto the bus?

901
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:51,490
If it can be resolved with money,
that's really easy.

902
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,662
Ahjussi!

903
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:54,431
Do I seem like a joke to you?
