Episode 1

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,184
<i>Let's hear a song.
Hey! Geonbeh!</i>

5
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:26,771
<i>Sing a song. Sing a song. Sing a song...</i>

6
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:29,190
<i>...I think she's spitting
up. Come here,</i>

7
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:31,097
<i>- Yu Ni. Aye!
- Here</i>

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,512
<i>Wow! she's really gotten heavy.</i>

9
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,538
Here. Kiss.

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,018
Why are you looking at other people's phones?

11
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,304
Aigoo, really.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,776
come here, come here. Hand it over!

13
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,016
I've ended it with her.

14
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,435
- You've ended it but she's still texting you?!
- I've really ended it...

15
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:50,521
<i>Everyone in the class has gone, everyone.
But me! What is that?!</i>

16
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,095
We can't, I have to study.

17
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,786
Oppa, are you crazy?

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,668
Where are you ranked in class
that studying makes a difference?

19
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>You'll say anything to your brother!</i>

20
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,604
You look after you...

21
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,492
You're really tense.

22
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>That's why I keep you, old man.</i>

23
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:08,336
<i>You're not keeping me,
I'm keeping you.</i>

24
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,706
Episode 1
What's wrong with liking being alone?

25
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:52,708
What?

26
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,629
<i>Were you sleeping?</i>

27
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:55,946
What?

28
00:02:57,405 --> 00:03:00,184
Remember there's a party at Mr. Jung's?

29
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:01,603
There was?

30
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,227
I'm okay.

31
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>What do you mean okay?</i>

32
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:09,890
Mr. Jung has someone to introduce to you and asks when you'll be here.

33
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,690
Because of the reconstruction...

34
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,900
Hello?

35
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:53,152
<i>Wow!</i>

36
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:55,237
It's so pretty.

37
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,651
Pretty, huh?

38
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,003
Patient Joo Hong Bok gave it to me when he was discharged.

39
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:01,906
Oh, that old man...

40
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,865
at first, he didn't trust you because you were a woman. "Give me a male doctor," he said.

41
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:08,312
Making such a stubborn fuss, then...

42
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,207
You're not leaving?

43
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:13,632
<i>Didn't you say you had an appointment?</i>

44
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:17,119
Oh. I better go.

45
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:18,350
Doctor.

46
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,573
Are you getting set up tonight?

47
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:23,162
How'd you know?

48
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:24,544
It's written on your face.

49
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,326
"What a bother."

50
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:35,578
In Korea somewhere, there must be a factory creating problem men.

51
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,275
They're consistently similar.
Indeed, I am feeling that way.

52
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,742
They tore up and changed everything.

53
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,163
It's the new wife's taste.

54
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,712
What are you doing?
This is someone else's home?

55
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:29,375
Hyun Kyu, I'm here.

56
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,260
What about Director Jo?

57
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,437
Even if I don't tell you, if you just glance...

58
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:40,413
Yeah, even though you didn't tell me, I just glanced and found him.

59
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,349
Where did he buy such embarrassing clothes?

60
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,968
Do you like spaghetti?

61
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:56,734
This?

62
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:04,044
Usually spaghetti is normally
about 1.9 mm in diameter.

63
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,719
But this, you can see is rather thin.

64
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:14,274
To be precise, this is not
spaghetti, but spaghettini.

65
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,751
The thinnest pasta is about 1mm in diameter.

66
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,580
They refer to it as angel hair.

67
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,325
In Italian, capelini.

68
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,128
Director,

69
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:36,772
the pretty girls really hate
it when you speak precisely.

70
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,633
I've told you over and over again.

71
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,413
I don't have any interest.

72
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:48,165
I suppose Mr. Jung's latest wife has arrived by now.

73
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,182
Yes.

74
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,481
Oh, my.

75
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,805
The interior has totally changed.

76
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,091
The second floor is a total love hotel.

77
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:58,737
How was it?

78
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,655
Nothing worth looking at.

79
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,540
What can you do?
After a construction is done,

80
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,200
whether they plaster it with ribbons or whatever, it's all up to the owner.

81
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,224
Precisely speaking,

82
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,623
this house is no longer my product.

83
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,586
I'm going to take myself off the credits.

84
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,581
Contact the construction magazines.
Call them and let them know.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,414
What?

86
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:24,234
Hey.

87
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,074
It's an award-winning house.

88
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:28,949
Do you know how many clients come looking for us after seeing this house?

89
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,539
That kind of client,

90
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,081
you can introduce to that woman.

91
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:40,773
Congratulations.

92
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:45,989
So many people have come,
it's been too crazy to say hello to everyone.

93
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,696
Oh, nice.

94
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,500
Most people can't digest my creations.

95
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:59,237
Ohhh. No wonder...

96
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,750
The man who designed
this house, Jo Jae Hee.

97
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:09,620
- And this...
- Ah, I'm Yun Ki Ran.

98
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,523
When my friends come, I'll introduce you.

99
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:17,554
They are architecting a remodel,
so I told them put their trust in the 2 of you.

100
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:21,437
Thank you. I don't know how
many times you've helped us.

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,112
I left it up to a firm to touch up the interior,
the finishing touches were just...

102
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:35,306
Ultimately, fashion, and construction, the high end products come from the final fingertips.

103
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:38,242
Isn't that so?

104
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:44,334
The house has become sooo romantic!

105
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:47,310
It's indeed different.

106
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:52,539
Oppa, remember we were
interviewed by the magazine?

107
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,374
They wanted us to send them
the profile of the architect.

108
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,175
Why don't you ask him for it directly?

109
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,921
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send it...

110
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:02,977
Mr. Jung,

111
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,158
if I cut these clothes and make it into an apron,

112
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,569
how would you feel?

113
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,253
<i>Excuse me?</i>

114
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,141
I'll be a professor shortly.

115
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,608
These days, a professor and a doctor...

116
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,898
There are a lot of married couples like that.

117
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,026
Perhaps.

118
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,693
Being a professor of practical music is really stressful.

119
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,430
I have to write music, I have to sing.

120
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:41,265
I have to dine with people.
So, health is really important.

121
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,360
That's why we're well matched.

122
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,429
Perhaps.

123
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:47,668
If you're hot, maybe take off...

124
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,332
I'm not hot. No.

125
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,462
Do I look hot?

126
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,858
Ah, yes. Fashion.

127
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:00,566
Ah, how about quitting immediately and opening up your own practice?

128
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:01,388
Excuse me?

129
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,653
My mother will loan you the startup costs.

130
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:06,352
Anything between a parent and child...

131
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:07,901
Well,

132
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,943
In Eunpyeong-gu, my
grandmother has a building.

133
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:18,839
The first floor is currently a convenience store.
I think you should open there.

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,388
W-w-wait a minute, please.

135
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,695
Since earlier, you've kept talking as though marriage was a given...

136
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,223
that's the way it sounds.

137
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,557
Of course.

138
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,987
Excuse me?

139
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,173
Why is he getting mad?

140
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:47,392
You called his house a refurbished apron...
How he could he not get mad?

141
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:51,278
Can you drop me off on your way back?

142
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,414
- I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.

143
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,648
You're the one that always stirs up the trouble,
Manager Yoo is always the one that apologizes.

144
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,106
She hasn't done anything wrong,
but she apologizes out of habit.

145
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:08,784
That's her problem, that one.

146
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,308
I just don't know.

147
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,934
The documentary is over.

148
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,405
What documentary? Huh?

149
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,295
The western gilled mushroom.

150
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,909
Mushrooms, caverns, paper... don't just watch documentaries all the time.

151
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,229
It would be nice if you paid some attention to the feelings of those around you.

152
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,374
Then wouldn't your life be
less like a childless old man?

153
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,509
Who's a childless old man?

154
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:46,213
You're 40 and unmarried.
Aren't you a childless old man?

155
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:53,209
Tear apart and change a house to suit your wife, have your personality emasculated, your character taken away...

156
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,567
Add a child to the mix...

157
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:59,501
that's such a bombshell I don't
even want to speak of it.

158
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:01,724
Marriage?

159
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,055
Why do it?

160
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,987
That's just a waste of time.

161
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:09,418
I'm going.

162
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,284
Welcome.

163
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,520
You're only taking out 2?

164
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:51,479
Normal weekdays, 2.
Fridays, 6.

165
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,816
That's your usual pattern.

166
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,290
Why meddle in a customer's personal matters?

167
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,499
Well, I was just...

168
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,841
Ah, tomorrow is the weekend.

169
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:04,845
Yes.

170
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,573
6 in all.

171
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:20,175
Wow. It's a really great apartment building.

172
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:21,628
<i>Sanggu.</i>

173
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,708
<i>Is it really okay for us to live so lush?</i>

174
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,066
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

175
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,426
Why isn't it working?

176
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,435
Isn't there a watchman around?

177
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:58,829
Sanggu, I'm going to look for
the watchman, so wait here.

178
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,932
Okay?

179
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,444
W-wait!

180
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,692
Wait a minute! Oh! Wait for me, ajussi!

181
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,757
<i>Ajussi! Ajussi.</i>

182
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,292
Let me in with you.

183
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,726
Ajussi!

184
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,092
Oh, the watchman.

185
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,260
Uncle begged me not to let even one of you die.

186
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,586
Eat well, and let's pass the
time well together, little fish.

187
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,186
We're staying here for just 6 months.

188
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:12,292
You better not tear up or break any of uncle's stuff.

189
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:13,962
Got it?

190
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,412
I wonder if I'm supposed
to just hammer this?

191
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,405
[Jo Jae Hee]

192
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:37,927
<i>I'm here.</i>

193
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,471
You must have dropped by somewhere first.

194
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,222
At Matthew Jung's house.

195
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,382
You've worked hard.

196
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,246
Would you like coffee?

197
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,152
Yeah.

198
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,208
That client Mr. Jung was talking about, he introduced to another architect.

199
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,463
Whatever.

200
00:17:57,884 --> 00:18:00,923
In our country, landmark cultural assets are difficult to preserve.

201
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,147
Don't they know the value?

202
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:04,144
Here.

203
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:09,408
Did he just refer to Mr. Jung's house as a landmark cultural asset when he's the one who built it?

204
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,154
What about a national treasure?

205
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,702
I finished the new model.

206
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,479
Oh, it's all done.

207
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,545
The reconstruction was resolved,
and the common living area has become softer.

208
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:19,628
<i>And, that window was put in.</i>

209
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,793
There seemed to be a mature
persimmon tree above it.

210
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,364
So, in the fall, they can feel the excitement in seeing the permissions.

211
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:30,916
Oh, that's why you chose an L-shaped window arrangement.

212
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:37,066
I sketched the table to
go under the window also.

213
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,643
Let's push it in this direction.

214
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,807
It's good.

215
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,650
<i>Indeed,</i>

216
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,798
<i>your plans are great with common space.</i>

217
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:55,502
It's counter to today's focus on privacy,
but it's got to be like this to be a family space.

218
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,670
You can just imagine them harmoniously enjoying each other's company.

219
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,069
For the time-being, they'd be harmonious.

220
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,736
After a year or two,

221
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:12,187
the mother will leave for the states for the child's education.

222
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:15,352
Then, in this spacious kitchen,

223
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:18,209
the father alone opens up his cup ramen.

224
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:22,948
An irregular eating schedule,
a chaotic personal life,

225
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,618
drinking himself to voluntary oblivion.

226
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,125
With his ghastly yellowing face,
he drearily ekes out a living.

227
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,926
Do old bachelors suffer from hysteria too?

228
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:48,211
He already has a weird personality, but it keeps getting worse.

229
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:53,361
Since he can't get married himself,
he's now even cutting down other happy families.

230
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:56,195
So, introduce him to some women.

231
00:19:56,631 --> 00:20:00,100
Marriage aside, don't you think he'd be a little better if he had a girlfriend?

232
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,914
Look at that Jack Nicholson ahjussi from "As Good As It Gets."

233
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,255
He met a woman, and the guy totally changed.

234
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,242
What are you doing?

235
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:14,206
I'm looking for friends I'd want to cut ties with to introduce him to.

236
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,365
I'm being serious now.

237
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,009
Going to the store, doing errands for him?
How long does it have to be that way?

238
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:25,732
I've been cleaning up his
messes going on 8 years.

239
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,124
That long, you've been breaking
your back apologizing?

240
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:33,790
But you bear it well, without blowing up. Huh?

241
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:37,622
You're so good. You're one
of these day's decent youth.

242
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,532
What can I do?

243
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:42,271
His products are amazing.

244
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,419
I got to put up with it until I
can suck it all out of him.

245
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:46,502
You don't have to put up with anything.

246
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:47,887
There are tons of architects out there.

247
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:48,952
You heard?

248
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,759
This wall is crooked.

249
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,239
Don't take it off! I'll do it!

250
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,250
Let's go to the site.

251
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,820
Now?

252
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,177
Really, isn't there anyone who can save me?

253
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,241
I'm going crazy. Movies and music...

254
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,454
We got one wall between neighbors, how could he be like that?

255
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:20,935
Apartments are all like that.

256
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:24,095
The people above us have these kids that run around all the time.

257
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:29,403
Hey, it's way beyond that degree.
It's like I'm at the filming of the movie.

258
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,218
And it's day after day!

259
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,506
Really, if he does that one more time,

260
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,339
I won't just take it quietly.

261
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,195
- I'll take him down.
- Okay, let's go!

262
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:40,096
Yes!

263
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:44,244
I'll go to Kangnam.

264
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:45,741
You go to Shinchong.

265
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,237
You really do like Kangnam.

266
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,838
It's Terranova (Terra Nova, the "New Land").

267
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,760
That special district where the disciples of finance and law are concentrated...

268
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,037
Korea's money line.

269
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:59,949
Hey. If you hang out there, are they going to throw you that money line?

270
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:04,469
Hey, famous men are pouring
out of every building,

271
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:08,212
my catching one,
it could happen.

272
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:12,499

Ahh, nice.

But your boyfriend is a consummate freeloader going on 3 years.

275

You come here.

276
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,338

<i>Why are you so naughty today?</i>

281
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,666
<i>You'll stretch my clothes.
Are you going to keep it up?</i>

282
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,353
<i>All right, already.
Okay!</i>

283
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:07,854
What kind of trash has moved in?

284
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:14,052
I love you too, hmm?

285
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,602
He's starting again?!

286
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:25,807
That man, really...
is he nuts?!

287
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,339

291
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,527
You better answer.

292
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:42,211
Look here!

293
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,994
I'm from next door. Open
your door for a moment.

294
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:49,844
Oh, aigoo...

295
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:55,267
What the...?

296
00:25:57,915 --> 00:25:59,080
Look here!

297
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,090
<i>Excuse me.</i>

298
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,874
Are you hurt?

299
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:32,344
Can't you see?

300
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:45,612
I'll answer it for you.

301
00:26:57,122 --> 00:27:00,405

the meeting for tomorrow.

Whoever you are is fine, just
take the guy and live with him.

307
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:10,833
Please.

308
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,601
What's this all about?

309
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,647
You see, the phone's owner has collapsed.

310
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,370
Ah, just a moment.

311
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,670
What hospital are we going to?

312
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,138
Haemyung Hospital.

313
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,097
Me?

314
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,280
He's asking to go to S.D. hospital.

315
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,595
Is there a doctor he knows?

316
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:49,909
Perhaps?

317
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,582
Aren't you his wife?

318
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,958
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

319
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:58,569
Yes, come to S.D. hospital.

320
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,852
<i>Change direction to S.D. hospital.</i>

321
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:12,665
- What's his condition.
- Oh, doctor. Here.

[Symptoms: Anal hemorrhaging, stomach pain, HTN (Hypertension/high blood pressure)]

323
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:21,978
His stomach pain must have been severe.
I think it's calmed down a bit.

324
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,563
<i>There are no issues with his vitals.</i>

He says he'd like to be treated
by the Chief or Orthopedics.

327
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:45,435
Doctor Yeom is on vacation.

328
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,037
What about Dr. Park Kwang Nam?

329
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:54,611
The vice president?

330
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:57,556
He finished with the board meeting and has left.

331
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,291
Um, he's asked when did Dr. Park
Kwang Nam become vice president.

332
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:15,629
As guardian, we ask you wait here.

333
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:17,195
Yes.

{\a6}[Consultation Room 1]

335
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,655

<i>I'm checking for anemia.</i>

337
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,374
The bleeding must have been very severe.

How much blood came out?

339
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,059
I didn't look.

340
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:43,379
Are you telling me it's hemorrhoids?

341
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:47,404
I'm not sure yet. We
should stop the bleeding first.

342

How was the color of the blood?

343
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:53,190

It would be hard to have a bowel movement.

354
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:32,431
So, in trying too hard to move your bowels,

355
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:37,179
there was pressure right here, which made your stomach hurt , and caused bleeding.

356
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:49,619
Please take off your
pants and undergarments.

357
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:55,051
I'll be doing an anal examination.

358
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,629
An exam's probably unnecessary. No thank you.

359
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:11,193
This is a hospital. No need to be embarrassed.

360
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,314
Please sit.

361
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:16,018
- Please get ready.
- Um, well...

362
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:18,591
Embarrassed...

363
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,249
It, it seems fine...

364
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:26,672
It hurt enough for you to ride an ambulance,
and there was bleeding.

365
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:29,170
If you just leave it, it could get much worse.

366
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,502
Please get ready.

367
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,548
I won't do the exam.

368
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,247
I'll put you on Ringer's solution to address the hemorrhaging.

369
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:03,281
Stay one night at the hospital, and after that, we'll take a look at the blood tests,

370
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:07,194
watch your condition, and then make a decision. Will that do?

371
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:11,484
Bathroom...

372
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:14,133
Bathroom, quickly...

373
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,567
<i>Come this way.</i>

374
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,958
Help him walk.

375
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:19,802
Quickly, hurry.

376
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:26,645
Prepare a room and,

377
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:31,276
500 cc of IV drip to stop the bleeding.

378
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:32,503
Yes.

379
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,846
And please, check him in.

380
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:40,245
I don't really know that man.

381
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,867
Hmm?

382
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:46,221
He's my next-door neighbor.
I met him for the first time today.

383
00:32:47,408 --> 00:32:49,691
I see.

384
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:51,944
But, um...

385
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:55,640
was that man trying to run away?

386
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:58,648
Yes.

387
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,864
You have a patient that just came in named Jo Jae Hee, don't you?

388
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,427
- An emergency patient?
- Yes.

389
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:13,580
Just a moment.

390
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:20,849
Excuse me.

391
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:24,151
You're the one I spoke to on the phone, aren't you? In the ambulance.

392
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:24,918
Yes.

393
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:26,537
What happened?

394
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:30,843
I don't know very much.
In any case, I don't think it's serious.

395
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:36,124
If you turn that direction,
you'll see the consultation room.

396
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:37,808
Why don't you go and see?

397
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,274
Well then...

398
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,293
Excuse me.

399
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,320
How do you know our Director?

400
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:53,047
He's my neighbor whom I
met for the first time today.

401
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:56,967
Ah, just a sec.

402
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,350
I'm Park Hyun Kyu.

403
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,019
So?

404
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,184
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

405
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:06,935
I have a boyfriend.

406
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:10,079
You saved our Director's life,
I should at least buy you dinner.

407
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,549
When you feel like it...

408
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:18,050
What the ..?

409
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,024
<i>That woman's a quack.</i>

410
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:25,757
One night's sleep and I feel fine.

411
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:30,038
Patients who talk like that always seem to return.

412
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:34,603
It's your fault.

413
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:36,444
I had an emergency, so why were you out?

414
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,759
I'd love to have the night shift every night,
but the system's a lottery.

415
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,969
You're pathetic.

416
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:47,470
You can't even have a proper affair.
Looks like you're in someone's grip.

417
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,603
Act like a son.

418
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,494
After your mom became alone,
She's really been down.

419
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:56,181
Is it a bother because she keeps going in and out of your house?

420
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:58,650
It's sad to let her eat alone.

421
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:02,244
If she comes and eats with us,
I'm happy with it.

422
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:03,514
But,

423
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:06,787
I went home last night,

424
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,612
there was a screen in the living room.

425
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,919
I'm starting to notice that
her stuff is slowly starting to...

426
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,326
That's her specialty.

427
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:23,311
When she sees a crack, she digs in slyly.
Then, she completely subjugates.

428
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,717
Yun Hee's like that too.

429
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:32,297
She couldn't possibly be
planning to live with us, could she?

430
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,066
Who knows with that mother/daughter pair.

431
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:39,969
They might have been in cahoots and are now together at the breakfast table.

432
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:42,926
Daddy!

433
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,547
Aigoo! Ye Won!

434
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:46,672
What's this?

435
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:50,631
Grandma brought porridge for uncle.

436
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:54,045
What's wrong with this one?

437
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:59,463
The inflammation has gone down,
and we're just watching his condition.

438
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,845
How bad was it that you checked in because of hemorrhoids?

439
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,905
It was an inflammation.

440
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,563
Uncle, do you have hemorrhoids?

441
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,890
Yeah, they say it's hemorrhoids.

442
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:15,361
Anyway, it's a relief that it's not life-threatening.

443
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,566
It doesn't matter what happens to you,

444
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:20,762
if you just die like this,

445
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:23,803
It's an injustice because I
don't get to see a grandchild.

446
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,523
You have a grandchild.

447
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,648
Ye Won is a Park.

448
00:36:27,995 --> 00:36:28,918
Isn't she?

449
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:30,340
Of course!

450
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:36,553
She's the daughter of the Park family that'll have her pick later of all the men after this hospital.

451
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:41,352
Will the hospital be around that long?

452
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:45,241
Listen to his sarcasm.
Just like his father.

453
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,584
He's nothing like me, this one.

454
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:51,333
Be careful so she doesn't bite the hose.

455
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,183
Yes.

456
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,087
Doctor. Telephone.

457
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:57,566
My father?

458
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:58,457
Yes.

459
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,917
You put the receiver down, right?
Just leave it.

460
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:03,156
Yes.

461
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,216
You guys marry early.

462
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,689
There's a window of time for marriage.

463
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,370
If you miss it, time just flies by you.

464
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,469
Yes, it's me.

465
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,112
Yes. It worked out like that.

466
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:41,798
We just didn't connect...

467
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:48,509
I told you I didn't want to go on that blind date.

468
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:53,176
I want to get married too. If I meet the right person, I will get married.

469
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,312
Why is this always just a
one-way conversation?

470
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:59,109
Because you're like this every time, I...

471
00:37:59,271 --> 00:37:59,991
Yes?

472
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:03,569
Excuse me for interrupting
your marriage woes,

473
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,406
It's not exactly woes, what's the issue?

474
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:10,489
I'm getting discharged.
Good day.

475
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,002
Excuse me?

476
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,599
Father, I'll call you right back.

477
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,003
Excuse me.

478
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:17,117
<i>Excuse me.</i>

479
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:19,815
We said we'd decide after looking at the blood test? And healing time...

480
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,653
I'm fine. Thanks to you.

481
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:25,852
You feel fine because of the flushing with Ringer solution. The problem hasn't been treated.

482
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,006
It'll come right back.

483
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:30,093
If it does, I'll come back and see you. And, I've got things to do.

484
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,937
Wait to recover completely and then leave.

485
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:35,853
You're not young anymore.

486
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:41,349
What?

487
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,319
Did you have some stressful situation because of your age?

488
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,117
We're not talking about me right now.

489
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,611
If you let the condition worsen, you're the one that will suffer, so why are you doing this?

490
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:57,731
Tell the vice president that this wallpaper leaves something to be desired.

491
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,210
I'm not through with your inflammation.

492
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:03,112
Let's focus on the subject.

493
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:06,803
My inflammation has asked me to relay to you that your work is done.

494
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,304
Is that so?

495
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,137
- It's a great pity.
- The feeling is mutual.

496
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:16,102
Then go.

497
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,288
Ah.

498
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,060
There will come a day

499
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:24,478
when the pain is so great you'll grab on for dear life and cry.

500
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,020
Please relay that to your inflammation.

501
00:39:27,804 --> 00:39:29,305
I definitely will.

502
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:39,987
Director.

503
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:45,219
You said you'd be in later.
Are you okay now?

504
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,322
Can you make the letters larger?

505
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,752
Director, you can't see these?

506
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,174
You're over the hill.

507
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:01,040
Here.

508
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:10,107
That woman was totally my type.

509
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:13,410
She'd get you some public attention.

510
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,292
Who?

511
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:15,597
The doctor.

512
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:17,410
I didn't see the doctor.

513
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,921
Your doctor that treated you was a woman?

514
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,223
Where is Manager Yun?

515
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:31,276
The deal that Matthew Jung was
going to hook us up with

516
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,205
went to Moon Seok Han.

517
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,946
Who the hell is this Moon Seok Han?

518
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:37,213
Shall I show you?

519
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:39,216
Just one moment.

520
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,018
This guy.

521
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:51,608
He doesn't show a product,

522
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:53,699
but he puts up a topless photo?

523
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,669
He's a famous playboy.

524
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,388
He's 43, and a Casanova bachelor.

525
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,016
Pathetic guy.

526
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:17,263
I'm thinking of hitting on
your next door neighbor.

527
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:19,122
It's okay, right?

528
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:21,368
You don't have to get my permission for what you do in your personal life.

529
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:23,115
I understand.

530
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:29,860
She apparently has a boyfriend.

531
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,180
Named Sanggu.

532
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:33,660
I know.

533
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:45,994
Oppa, it's me.

534
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:47,495
Where are you?

535
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:49,314
<i>In the library.</i>

536
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:54,763
The weather's already hot.
It's hard to study, isn't it.

537
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,021
<i>It's okay.</i>

538
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,107
<i>They have the air conditioner on in the library today.</i>

539
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:02,137
Is it possible you're wanting to see me?

540
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:08,005
Can you see people every time want to see them?

541
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:10,454
If you want,

542
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,173
I can rush over immediately.

543
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:15,039
Where are you?
Aren't you at the office?

544
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:16,826
I'm at the office.

545
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:18,995
Where else would I be at this hour?

546
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:21,112
Yu Jin, the person next to
me is giving me a dirty look.

547
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:22,118
Got to go.

548
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,696
Hello?

549
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:25,866
Hey!

550
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:27,053
Kim Tae Hyul!

551
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:35,340
Hyung.

552
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,707
- Hyung!
- What?

553
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,920
I brought bread.
Eat first.

554
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:46,856
<i>Eat with us.</i>

555
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:49,114
Your pool pals have changed.

556
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:51,318
Who's that?

557
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,693
Hey, what about your office?

558
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:54,693
Oh my.

559
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:57,046
Oppa, you put down 200?

560
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,237
You must have been betting.

561
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:05,096
He's 400.

562
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:09,088
Well, if you barely study and fail the civil service exam for three years,

563
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,263
everyone plays at about that level.

564
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:14,255
Eat first.

565
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:16,787
It's probably all melted.

566
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:18,048
Oh my.

567
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:19,793
Come here.

568
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:20,954
Let's eat.

569
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:22,472
<i>Please eat.</i>

570
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,860
Hello, just in time for

571
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:28,459
summer, we're having an event.

572
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:30,204
<i>Welcome and please try a taste.</i>

573
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:31,819
Thank you. Yes.

574
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:33,121
Please enjoy.

575
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,988
Hello.

576
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,273
I was studying and came out briefly to cool off.

577
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,972
Hey.

578
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,246
I don't like making long explanations.

579
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:50,278
Do you really want to kill time at the pool hall when others are studying or working?

580
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,625
Let's stop this. There are lots of people around.

581
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:54,857
Laying into me earlier was enough.

582
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:59,392
I got it, so go on inside and study.

583
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:02,011
Do you want to go see a movie later?

584
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:03,243
Are you nuts?!

585
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:06,252
Didn't you say you had to finish a mountain of work this week?

586
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:11,431
Aren't you getting out of here?

587
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:21,724
Oppa.

588
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:26,057
I'll call you later.

589
00:44:28,102 --> 00:44:29,062
Call me.

590
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,559
Really nice.

591
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,024
Hello. Just fill this out.

592
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:43,317
Shall I give you a spoon?

593
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:43,969
No, thanks.

594
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:45,693
Do you have a points card?

595
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,143
No, I don't.

596
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,855
<i>$13, please.</i>

597
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:05,570
Mun Seok Hwan.

598
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:12,767
- A woman.
- Get in.

599
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:19,213
What?

600
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:21,266
Mun Seok Hwan?

601
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,199
He's with a woman.

602
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:24,741
A woman?

603
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,577
Is she pretty?

604
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,742
She's beating up on him.
Right on the street.

605
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:31,663
Where is that?

606
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:36,040
What guys like you are talking about

607
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,437
is precisely that kind of thing.

608
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:44,449
Still, I think our kind is better off than you.

609
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,631
Wait a minute, my foot!

610
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,676
You think having a nice car
is all you need? Piece of...

611
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:50,306
I really never said that.

612
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:52,119
Yeah right! The rumors are all over!

613
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,347
You low-life, lower than low-life! I can't believe...

614
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:59,373
Pani, you helped me earlier,
and I'm always so thankful.

615
00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:01,011
Can we be friends?

616
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,210
Sure.

617
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,657
I applied.

618
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:07,762
I'm 16. How old are you?

619
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,667
If it's similar, let's drop the formal speech.

620
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:21,632
I'm one year older.

621
00:47:28,457 --> 00:47:30,271
<i>Yu Jin,
What's the matter?</i>

622
00:47:31,194 --> 00:47:33,610
Okay, let's go in 10 minutes.
I'm almost done. Look.

623
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,606
10 minutes and then we'll go see a movie.

624
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,259
<i>10 minutes?! Do you know
how long we've been here?</i>

625
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:40,049
What do you mean?
I'm almost done. Look.

626
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,128
It's been 4 hours.

627
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:44,062
Just 5 minutes, 5 minutes, and I'll be done. 5 minutes, okay?

628
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:47,888
Yu Jin, where are you going? Yu Jin!
I'll be quick. Just 5 minutes.

629
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:43,926
<i>Happy birthday, customer!</i>

630
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,366
<i>At NT, we will always do our best for you.</i>

631
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:08,495
This...

632
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:10,368
<i>Foreman.</i>

633
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:13,878
I told you to get Italian Travertine.

634
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:14,858
Italian?

635
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,558
Travertine is what it is.

636
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:20,952
Whether it's Italy, China, or Turkey.
There's really not much difference.

637
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,412
What do you mean there's
not much difference?

638
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:26,718
Get rid of these immediately and re-order.

639
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,266
Why would you kick those?

640
00:49:29,682 --> 00:49:30,844
Listen, punk!

641
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:33,721
Listen, punk?

642
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:36,126
I've had 30 years of experience
on construction sites now.

643
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,612
You don't think I know the
characteristics of the materials?!

644
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,855
You think just getting by for 30 years is something to boast about?

645
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:43,752
I pointed it out specifically so that guys like you wouldn't screw it up.

646
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:46,341
Just because we keep letting you get away with crap, you're...

647
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:49,186
Yeah push me, push me.

648
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,317
That's right, fall, fall.

649
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,735
Keep me up, keep me up. Push.

650
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:01,456
The 2 of them are at it again.

651
00:50:02,994 --> 00:50:03,793
<i>Director!</i>

652
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:06,281
Foreman, Foreman!

653
00:50:12,937 --> 00:50:15,998
Manager Yun, what in the
world are you doing?

654
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:19,834
Make it just like this,
and don't rattle your pea brain around.

655
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,679
I don't need this crap.

656
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,325
He thinks he's some sort of god.

657
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,838
Is this a bible?

658
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:31,793
With a career of 30 years,

659
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:34,477
you've got yourself a big lesson.

660
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:36,008
On a construction site,

661
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:38,105
this is the bible.

662
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:39,729
That son of a...

663
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,986
Oh, Foreman, Foreman!

664
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:45,886
<i>If I get up there, you're dead!</i>

665
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:49,112
<i>Just once, once, let it go, just once!</i>

666
00:50:49,782 --> 00:50:51,097
That's enough.

667
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:54,030
Hey, pack it up!

668
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:57,877
Foreman.

669
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:00,070
Move. This time, it was really...

670
00:51:00,085 --> 00:51:01,465
Foreman!

671
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:06,938
Here, here, check the window framing.
The amount of materials is wrong.

672
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,017
Director, you really...
went too far, don't you think?

673
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:12,939
What?

674
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:16,260
You know how site operations are run.

675
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,852
In front of all the laborers, if
you grab the foreman's throat

676
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,650
and step all over Manager Yun,

677
00:51:20,714 --> 00:51:23,487
what position are you putting the site workers in?

678
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,581
Other than getting my building completed properly,
I don't give a damn about anything.

679
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:30,715
Behind your back, they call
you a reclusive nut job.

680
00:51:31,063 --> 00:51:32,369
I don't care.

681
00:51:34,063 --> 00:51:38,913
How someone so seriously dysfunctional with personal relationships like you make such great homes?

682
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:39,646
<i>Huh?</i>

683
00:51:43,148 --> 00:51:44,545
They're really leaving!

684
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:45,635
<i>Foreman!</i>

685
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:50,083
See if I ever work with that punk again!

686
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,102
<i>- Foreman!
- Foreman!</i>

687
00:51:52,616 --> 00:51:54,835
<i>How can you just leave like that?!</i>

688
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,942
Can't they take it easy a little? Really!

689
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:38,168
Even at 40, I guess I still
come off as a woman.

690
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,401
You should have just let work
at the site come to a halt.

691
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:46,066
He knows you'll fix it.
That's why he pulls that crap!

692
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:48,528
I was kind of harsh on
Jae Hee earlier, wasn't I?

693
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,573
No, you done good. Eh?

694
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:53,468
Reclusive nut job, dysfunctional with personal relationships,

695
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:55,198
it was totally right on.

696
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:56,477
Hold on.

697
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,546
Isn't today his birthday?

698
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,907
It's not like he'll appreciate you remembering.

699
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:04,045
Why do you even keep track of that?

700
00:53:19,836 --> 00:53:20,975
What are you doing?

701
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:22,653
I'm at the Rose Festival or whatever it's called.

702
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:25,372
My sister and I even brought my parents.

703
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:28,443
It's crazy here.

704
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:30,923
<i>What is this? For daddy?</i>

705
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,347
<i>Ohhh! It's yummy.</i>

706
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:35,339
<i>Should I bring you another?</i>

707
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,448
Have fun.

708
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:40,603
One more, please.

709
00:53:40,723 --> 00:53:41,609
Okay.

710
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,626
Don't you have any friends to
celebrate your birthday with?

711
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:09,054
Celebrate birthdays at this age?

712
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:13,373
I stopped making seaweed soup since you made a fuss about not being a kid,

713
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:16,767
but why buy a stationery (specialty) cake?

714
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:19,664
In what neighborhood can you go to a stationery store and get a cake like this?

715
00:54:19,784 --> 00:54:21,612
Don't be smartass, you.

716
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:29,366
Sitting with your mother at 40, having seaweed soup, isn't such a pretty picture either, is it?

717
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,282
Think of the time when there
won't be a mother to sit with.

718
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,991
Go on.

719
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:37,881
Go where?

720
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,424
Let's go to my house.

721
00:54:40,696 --> 00:54:44,430
You've gotten a year older, you should at least have a bowl of seaweed soup.

722
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:49,662
<i>Hey! Jo Jae Hee!</i>

723
00:55:41,346 --> 00:55:45,564
Ah, I-I'm a friend of your next
door neighbor Yu Jin.

724
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,547
And so?

725
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:52,821
I got a strange call from her and came over worried, but she's not answering her door.

726
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:54,627
She must be out.

727
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,590
I can hear her phone ringing.

728
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,796
I'm sure she's in there.

729
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,624
And so?

730
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:10,725
Wow.

731
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:13,612
You have all sorts of things.

732
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:18,029
Every household needs to have an emergency escape set.

733
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:22,902
As long as I have this, even
if this building sets on fire,

734
00:56:22,977 --> 00:56:25,691
I can scale down the wall to the first floor.

735
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:30,629
I guess you'll have a long life.

736
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:34,093
Okay then, I'll leave it to you.

737
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:32,998
Hey.

738
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:37,429
Hey.

739
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:48,877
Oh, bitter.

740
00:58:54,706 --> 00:58:56,280
<i>Yu Jin!</i>

741
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,212
<i>Yu Jin, open the door!</i>

742
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:27,640
Why'd you drink so much?

743
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:30,742
<i>Did you something happen
between you and Tae Hyul?</i>

744
00:59:35,855 --> 00:59:37,082
Sanggu...

745
00:59:38,983 --> 00:59:40,375
<i>Sanggu...</i>

746
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,813
<i>Come here.</i>

747
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:44,876
- Sanggu!
- Sanggu?

748
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:46,355
<i>Sanggu.</i>

749
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:49,013
<i>What's he doing?</i>

750
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:53,289
Will you really be okay?

751
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:54,795
Yeah, thanks.

752
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:59,664
I'm sorry I put you through that.

753
01:00:00,584 --> 01:00:02,731
Is it okay to have a dog in an apartment?

754
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:04,681
He won't bark.

755
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:07,659
Sleep it off.

756
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:08,959
Bye.

757
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:13,723
Thank you.

758
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:35,324
Okay, then.

759
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:38,030
Good luck.

760
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:04,314
On our way. Transporting
patient with alcohol poisoning.

761
01:01:16,764 --> 01:01:18,684
Are you okay? Please sit down.

762
01:01:20,786 --> 01:01:24,618
I feel better now. I felt like I was dying before.

763
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:30,271
You saw me fighting with my boyfriend, didn't you?

764
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:33,514
You must have gotten mad
about him playing games again.

765
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:35,268
Is that why you drank so much?

766
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,463
We ended up splitting.

767
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:47,140
After seriously flailing for a few years,
I was turning into a totally different person.

768
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:52,533
It's become too hard for the two of us to get along, so we agreed to split up.

769
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:59,015
But you look totally different in plain clothes and the doctor's gown.

770
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,366
Maybe because it was a
PC lounge where I saw you,

771
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:04,303
but it's like...

772
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,243
the feeling of discovering Batman's true identity.

773
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:14,599
Did that ajussi leave?

774
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,778
I don't know.

775
01:02:17,474 --> 01:02:19,088
I didn't get to thank him.

776
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,671
Aigoo. Oh, are you feeling okay?

777
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:26,087
Jo Jae Hee is really odd.

778
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:27,887
He didn't take it?

779
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:32,128
Seriously, if you were kind enough to make out the prescription just in case,

780
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,029
then a "Thank you" and a
polite acceptance would be nice.

781
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:37,372
"That's not necessary"

782
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:38,938
<i>Then he just stand up and left.</i>

783
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:40,305
Isn't he in pain?

784
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:41,593
It must be bearable.

785
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:45,923
He wasn't treated, so he should be taking the meds.

786
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:49,933
It's his birthday today.

787
01:02:50,689 --> 01:02:51,535
It is?

788
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:55,088
Ah, he was born in '70.

789
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,732
'70, then... how old is he?

790
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:00,924
40.

791
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,472
40 years old. Since it's his birthday.

792
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:35,288
Yes?

793
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:38,790
This is Jang Mun Jung from S.D. Hospital.

794
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:41,798
How'd you get my number?

795
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,846
I called the vice president and asked him.

796
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:45,189
Just a moment.

797
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:49,561
Thank you. I didn't get to say it earlier.

798
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:53,551
Ah, well, it's fine.

799
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,452
And I owed you one from before.

800
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:00,173
How are you feeling? No more pain?

801
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,562
I'm sorry to defy your prophecy (in old Korean), but I'm completely fine.

802
01:04:05,353 --> 01:04:09,309
Why do you always manage to use unpleasant ancient expressions?

803
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:14,296
Today's your birthday, isn't it?

804
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:15,119
Yes.

805
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:20,758
was it?

806
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,697
Do you want to have a birthday party?

807
01:04:25,953 --> 01:04:30,697
Someone brought in a cake as a gift,
so we were about to get together and eat it.

808
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,474
<i>The cake is here.</i>

809
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,330
Is he going to come?

810
01:04:35,402 --> 01:04:37,591
If you haven't gone too far, then come by.

811
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:40,025
That's not necessary.

812
01:04:40,265 --> 01:04:43,579
There's no need to go all the way over there for a few cake crumbs.

813
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:47,248
I was asking with the best of intentions, do you have to...

814
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:48,542
Best of intentions?

815
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,711
Why are you always so prickly?

816
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:57,689
Doctor Jang, why don't you
think about it carefully yourself.

817
01:04:57,975 --> 01:05:00,867
If you can't married,
there's definitely a reason.

818
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:04,212
I'd like return that same comment to you.

819
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:07,740
For me, it's not that I can't, it's that I don't.

820
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:08,781
Oh my.

821
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:13,766
A 40 year old man making exclamations in the street is so dignified.

822
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:19,523
I'm hanging up now.

823
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,850
Yes, let's.

824
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,363
Hello?

825
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:27,803
Hello?

826
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,493
What's the matter?

827
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:35,726
I told you that you needed proper treatment.

828
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:36,996
Does it hurt a lot?

829
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,724
I'm okay.

830
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,400
I'm ok-ok, oh my stomach.

831
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:57,214
Aigoo, my stomach.

832
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:01,168
Aigoo, aigoo.

833
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:08,111
Uh? This guy. Wasn't he the
one earlier with the girl?

834
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,763
It's not like we're a taxi service.

835
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:18,086
<i>I'm checking your eyes.</i>

836
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,900
Please call the vice president.

837
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:28,988
He's not here.
How many times have I told you?

838
01:06:29,892 --> 01:06:32,918
Then, let's do the Ringer solution like before.

839
01:06:36,656 --> 01:06:38,045
Didn't you hear me?

840
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:42,990
You don't listen to the doctor,
so it's ultimately come to this.

841
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:45,275
I told you you'd grab on for dear life and cry

842
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:48,847
Grab on for dear life and cry...
are making fun of... Oh!

843
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:01,022
I'm going to examine you.

844
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,564
This woman, really!

845
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:03,907
Tone it down!

846
01:07:04,612 --> 01:07:08,115
If you stubbornly resist and continue shouting, you'll just damage your body and humiliate yourself.

847
01:07:08,235 --> 01:07:09,603
Will you have anything left?

848
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:11,274
Who are you to, my butt...

849
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:12,838
What?

850
01:07:13,313 --> 01:07:14,724
What did you say?!

851
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:31,705
Happy Birthday.

852
01:07:47,418 --> 01:07:48,945
Relax your muscles.

853
01:07:54,023 --> 01:07:56,805
Jo Jae Hee, relax your glutes.

<i>That Director guy,
You've seen him too.</i>

861
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:18,542
Shall I rev that engine for you?

862
01:08:18,571 --> 01:08:21,336
Shall I just let go and rush forward?

863
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,678
I wonder if that rusty car will move?

864
01:08:24,722 --> 01:08:26,344
Are you having fun?

865
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,233
Director, really...

866
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,599
making a woman cry...

867
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:31,022
The final target is a man.

868
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:35,442
<i>He says that I'm rusting as a woman!
I want to see just how rusty I am.</i>
