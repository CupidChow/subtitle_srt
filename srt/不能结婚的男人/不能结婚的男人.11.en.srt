{\a6}Please do NOT hardsub and/or stream this
episode using our English subtitles.

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,899
Now, all the weapons you can use are gone.
I'll do the surgery.

{\a6}Episode 11

5
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:14,014
I really want to know.

6
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:15,681
Are the two of you...

7
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,449
Dating or not?

8
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,497
We'll stop here.

9
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:45,626
We abided by our promise,
so Mom has to do the surgery.

10
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:49,609
Doctor Jang won't go on blind dates either.

11
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,522
Let's go out.

12
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,838
Yes.

13
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,992
They...

14
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:16,825
Seem to be in a weird mood.
Looks like we succeeded.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,035
Although I say he's my son,
I don't know what that fellow is thinking.

16
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,221
It's over.

17
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,647
Yes.

18
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:31,991
Here...

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,335
Oh, come over for a while.

20
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:36,792
The consent form for the surgery,
have you gotten the signature?

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,109
Here.

22
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,169
Mm...

23
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,657
- Doctor Jang.
- Yes.

24
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:46,582
Go, let's go.

25
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,088
Doctor...

26
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,811
Is there something to be happy about?

27
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,101
Mm, I've taken my vacation.

28
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,639
Hello?

29
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,129
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:19,047
What?

31
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,629
Is Doctor Jang your woman?

32
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,888
You actually said, Doctor Jang
won't go on blind dates anymore.

33
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:25,162
Wasn't that the conditions for the vacation?

34
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,252
No, the way you said it was,

35
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,296
like the two of you are a little...

36
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,650
Did you really go? With Doctor Jang?

37
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,023
Is that not okay?

38
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:41,678
Eh, it can't be...

39
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,067
You really went?

40
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,428
Aigoo, Jae Hee, well done!

41
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,410
Hey, hey, hey, did nothing happen?

42
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:52,709
What should happen?

43
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,502
When a guy and a girl go on vacation,

44
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:58,456
the atmosphere is there,
there should have been a decisive moment.

45
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,967
Ah, really..

46
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,944
I'm busy!

47
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:07,087
Aigoo, I'm really envious of you,
kid. Still dating at this age.

48
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:09,854
Dating?

49
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,914
The two of you look good together.

50
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,459
Aigoo, this fellow.

51
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,921
Oh, what should I do?

52
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,290
After you immigrate,
when can I see you again?

53
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,891
I really can't bear to.

54
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,982
Oh, okay. We will discuss the details
when we meet on that day.

55
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,001
<i>Yes. You must come.</i>

56
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,882
Of course. Saturday at 7?

57
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,353
Mm, okay.

58
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,146
Oh.

59
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:13,137
Episode 11
"The people I need in my life"

60
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,026
Customer...

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,723
Your expression is too stern,
smile a little.

62
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,559
Why do you care if I smile or not.

63
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,038
It's my photo, take it like that.

64
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:33,209
If you smile, you can attract love.
Smile a little. Smile.

65
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:35,228
Ah, yes.

66
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:37,319
Love?

67
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:47,386
That's good. Smile!

68
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:48,474
Smile.

69
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:49,956
Cheese.

70
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:50,903
Cheese.

71
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,117
Kimchi.

72
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:52,936
Kimchi.

73
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:58,727
Okay, that's good. Yes, that's good!

74
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:37,128
This is the first group design
since you entered the business.

75
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,601
Don't forget to cooperate
with all these people.

76
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,620
Be responsible for every word that you say,

77
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,797
and remember to maintain the
harmony among everyone. Fighting!

78
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:09,026
I told you there were no mistakes already!

79
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,542
Ah, I really can't stand him.

80
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,311
What is this?

81
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:32,448
There isn't any design like this.

82
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:33,863
Of course!

83
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,537
What in the world is this?

84
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:42,102
Ah, this? I came out with an idea.
What do you think? It's pretty, isn't it?

85
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,487
What?

86
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:51,216
This...

87
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,810
It's a joke, a joke.

88
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,584
I, cracked a joke.

89
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,345
Ah, Chief is a joker!

90
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:01,497
This is funny, right?

91
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,784
But this... It's stuck so firmly,
I should be able to tear it off.

92
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,947
If you have that kind of time on your hands,
concentrate on your work!

93
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,543
I did it so all of us can be happy.

94
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,333
It's not funny at all.

95
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,338
<i>Despite the time restriction..</i>

96
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,039
sheâ€™s still doing mindless things during
the construction process...

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,105
Ya, you!

98
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,777
What being lazy?! What mindless things?!
You... You're dead!

99
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:31,056
Ah, Chief, Chief, Chief!

100
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:39,672
Are you alright?

101
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,710
You...!

102
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,856
Both of you aren't stopping, really?!

103
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,723
Stop! Really!

104
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:02,884
<i>Aigoo, He Ping Villas was also
a product of Yun Ki Ran...</i>

105
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,885
<i>From 1 to 10, all of them.</i>

106
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,768
This is only a presentation
of Director Jo's ideas.

107
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,666
But...

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,090
why are we meeting here?
We could just meet at the firm.

109
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,955
These are the comprehensive terms
and conditions that I'm offering you.

110
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:34,159
Annual salary, benefits, projects.

111
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,794
Come to our company,
I'm formally offering you a job now.

112
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:47,649
I'm really sorry.

113
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:50,220
I still want to do projects
with Director Jo.

114
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,121
Firstly, this project is very important
to both me and Director Jo.

115
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,840
You really must pay a lot
of attention to it.

116
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,891
Manager Yun...

117
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:04,863
Are you going to continue being
Director Jo's office's wife?

118
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,209
Yes?

119
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:08,234
Isn't your pride hurt?

120
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,370
It looks like as a woman,
you won't be successful,

121
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,688
so you use the excuse
of being his partner...

122
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,589
trying your best to stay by
Jo Jae Hee's using any reason

123
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,333
Director Mun!

124
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:21,022
That's true. I touched on your
sore point, I'm sorry.

125
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,111
But, I really want you on my team.

126
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:25,876
Even if I have poke at any little
cracks in your relationship,

127
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:27,377
I want to make you one of my people.

128
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,532
If Jo Jae Hee...

129
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,948
If he really has a wife, what will you do?

130
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,653
That has nothing to do with me.

131
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:43,973
Aigoo, is that the reaction of someone
who is not concerned?

132
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,317
Really, you should feel a really
strong sense of betrayal, right

133
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,011
Oh, why?

134
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,021
What?

135
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,406
Everything has stopped here.

136
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,930
Manager, you have to rush over.

137
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:11,317
What about Director Jo?

138
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,266
Be a mediator, a mediator.

139
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,957
Don't let this trouble you.

140
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,730
If there's any trouble, there's Manager Yun
to settle it. I, concentrate on designing.

141
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,770
Ah, he's really shameless.

142
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:52,450
What, being lazy?

143
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:55,821
What, doing mindless things in order
to increase my daily activities?

144
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:58,422
Chief is someone like that.

145
00:10:58,547 --> 00:10:59,781
That damned fellow.

146
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,391
How pretty!

147
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,580
Right, I'm right! Does he know hearts?

148
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,568
Right, can that fellow know about hearts?!

149
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,870
Being alone at that age,
how lonely must he be.

150
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:14,685
Let him go have a relationship or something,
so he can get some love!

151
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:17,751
Then, we'll see his true colors.

152
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:24,003
Why did you bring that irritating fellow?

153
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,735
Ah, he's the one who's been
following me around recently.

154
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,025
Lover?

155
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,171
Eh. I could have no charm as a woman.

156
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,460
There are many people who
want to work with me,

157
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:37,916
but no one who wants to spend
their days with me.

158
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:41,537
That butter-like fellow...
Wants to work with you?

159
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:42,619
Mm.

160
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,588
That... Butter...

161
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:03,477
I'm sorry about just now. What's the matter?

162
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:06,765
Ya, that fellow is in trouble.

163
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:07,930
Why?

164
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,273
There's a butter-like fellow who's
working on Manager Yun.

165
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,921
That's the happiest thing
among all the news, why?

166
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,084
If it's not the case, then?

167
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,970
Scout?

168
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:27,432
All the spouses are invited,
so it's a little inconvenient.

169
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:31,053
But, it's a gathering for a friend who's
immigrating, so I can't not go.

170
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,076
Spouses only, then only Doctor is single?

171
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:36,078
Mm.

172
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,492
That's a little...

173
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,087
Should I call the Escort Company and
see how things work out?

174
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,473
Eh, why do you need an escort?

175
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,373
There are so many men around you.

176
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,408
Ask a favor from Jae Hee Ahjussi,
or Hyun Kyu.

177
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,761
Ah, really, I'm going crazy.

178
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,662
Why?

179
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:59,232
I'm being punished right now.

180
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,286
I went to a meeting without
telling Hyun Kyu.

181
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:04,865
And the person I met there,
keeps calling every 3 hours.

182
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:08,533
Every 3 hours? That's a little scary.

183
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,503
How did he even find out my phone number?

184
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:11,794
A stalker!

185
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh, that's pretty.

186
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,171
Oh my.

187
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:30,781
Oh, hello.

188
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:37,509
Ah, we met at Hyun Kyu's workplace.
You are Manager Yun, right?

189
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,783
Ah, hello.

190
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,406
Hello.

191
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,828
It looks like both your tastes
are very similar.

192
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,291
Even what you're wearing...

193
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,882
What should I do?

194
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,433
There's only one pair left of size 23.

195
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,902
We've contacted other outlets too
and they don't have stock either.

196
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,870
What should we do?

197
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,650
Do you have any plans to bring in more?

198
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,064
Because the stock is limited,
it's a little difficult.

199
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:29,424
Wow, what kind of fortune is this?

200
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:30,873
It's a brand that I've never
heard of before...

201
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,174
and it's handmade too!

202
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,195
You have to wear it prettily.

203
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:39,508
You have to stick on an insole
before you wear it.

204
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:42,865
It's very soft leather,
so you have to take good care of it.

205
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:43,822
Yes.

206
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:48,553
I'm really thankful to the two of you.
Today, just enjoy to the fullest, I'll pay.

207
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,006
Ha, scout?

208
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,602
That's ridiculous.

209
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,517
Where?

210
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,432
She seems to be drinking.

211
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:10,485
Drinking?

212
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,138
We've worked together for 8 years,

213
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,399
and got to know each other in university.

214
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,184
Counting the number of years,
it's been about 20 years.

215
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,652
Ah, that's an impressive amount of time.

216
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,788
Working with that Ahjussi, isn't it tiring?

217
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,077
But what he produces is always flawless.

218
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,982
With that character of his, if he didn't
do a good job, he wouldn't eat.

219
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,535
Because we've worked together for so long,
we're comfortable with each other.

220
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,490
Now, I look can look at his expression,
and know what he's thinking.

221
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,960
Expression?

222
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,084
Mm.

223
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:46,977
Like that, with one eye squinted,
means he wants to attack something.

224
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:47,778
And...

225
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,531
that sort of expression

226
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,055
means that there is something that he really
wants to say, but he's holding it in.

227
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:02,423
But, does he have an expression
that could be useful at work?

228
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:03,879
Ah, I'm not too sure.

229
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,543
It's just that I can read it, that's all.

230
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,898
Jae Hee is here too?

231
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:22,079
We heard it all from Chief.

232
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:23,840
What?

233
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:25,755
The scouting proposal.

234
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,403
Ah, the Chief too.

235
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,137
Scout?

236
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,320
Is it true?

237
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,054
Oh

238
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,424
Then, what will happen to your firm?

239
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,927
If Manager Yun leaves,
everything will be in a mess.

240
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,072
Where?

241
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,605
That, I can't say.

242
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,478
It can't be...

243
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,975
Mun Seok Hwan?

244
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,638
It's a secret.

245
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,698
So?

246
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:11,709
That... What do you think I should do?

247
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:14,497
Of course, stay by our sides.

248
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,515
I...

249
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:30,841
<i>Here! Customers, please pay attention!</i>

250
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,727
<i>Oyster Beer is holding a celebration
for their 30th anniversary,</i>

251
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:38,481
<i>if you just spin the roulette wheel,
lucky prizes will be plentiful!</i>

252
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>Who's going to spin it?</i>

253
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:47,716
<i>Ah, this handsome fellow,
you look lucky! Spin it once!</i>

254
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:51,628
- Ahjussi, spin it once!
- Go, spin it once!

255
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,486
<i>Spin it once!</i>

256
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:59,372
<i>What will he get?
He might very well get some Oyster Beer!</i>

257
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:00,607
Manager Yun...

258
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,182
He got a voucher to go to Jeju Island!

259
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,705
<i>Congratulations!</i>

260
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,854
<i>Wow, to have this kind of luck,</i>

261
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,852
<i>it's harder to get this compared
to striking the lottery!</i>

262
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:22,749
<i>To get this prize... I said before,
he looks lucky!</i>

263
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,371
<i>- Ah, he's too handsome.
- Jeju Island. Jeju Island!</i>

264
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,948
<i>He's really qualified, good-looking
and the flowers match him.</i>

265
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:37,730
<i>It's really good, good, good. How cool! Applause!</i>

266
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,775
When I got up,

267
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,117
my head was spinning.

268
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,934
Your dizziness might be caused by
your blood pressure.

269
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,676
Yun Ki Ran ...

270
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:08,674
You want to hold on to her?

271
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:11,151
Yes?

272
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:14,064
You still separated without
saying another word.

273
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,451
Ah, so it's this.

274
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:22,257
Yes?

275
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:25,334
Just, when you are holding back
from saying something,

276
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,831
the corner of your mouth will lift.

277
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:41,230
If you don't want her to leave,
just tell her.

278
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:42,728
Who?

279
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,177
Without Manager Yun,
the administration will become very messy.

280
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,273
Yes?

281
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,404
It will cause me to lose focus on my design.

282
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,831
You lost weight in just one day,
and you can still say something like that.

283
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,027
Trouble...

284
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,233
Can't you solve it by yourself?

285
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,796
There's nothing that I can't do.

286
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:17,417
- Just that...
- Just that you don't want to do it?

287
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,456
You're right.

288
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:26,536
You do need Yun Ki Ran.

289
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:31,558
I only need Manager Yun so I can
focus on my designs.

290
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:34,726
If only I were determined,
I would be able to handle it on my own too.

291
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,126
How could it be?

292
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:43,342
Your blood pressure is 150 over 90,
that's really high!

293
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,466
Doctor Jang is making my blood
pressure rise, now.

294
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,263
How can be sure this won't kill me...

295
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,753
Don't worry.

296
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,510
I know. Who said I was afraid?

297
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,369
I'm not afraid at all.

298
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,963
Mother-in-Law, it'll be over soon.

299
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:18,376
Just think of it as sleeping
for one or two hours.

300
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:22,260
After the surgery, you should be able
to run faster than me.

301
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:27,628
Jae Hee ah...

302
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,887
No matter how well we do,

303
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,009
there will still only be Oppa.

304
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:38,046
You even used your knees to threaten me,
what sounds are you making?

305
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:41,043
Didn't you say you were fine?

306
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,747
We're going in now.

307
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,227
Jae Hee ah.

308
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:01,448
Ya, who's that girl?

309
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,743
You saw that girl calling
Jae Hee's name, right?

310
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,725
Oh, it seems so.

311
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:12,124
What's wrong?

312
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:15,050
I came when I heard the news. How is it?

313
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:17,339
She's going in for her surgery now.

314
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,517
Go in, I'll wait for you here.

315
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:20,363
Okay.

316
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,188
Relax, we're going to anesthetize you now.

317
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,509
The surgery will take about 2 hours.

318
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,031
See her before you leave.

319
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:50,535
Are you still considering
the scout proposal?

320
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,355
When I got the proposal,
I thought, there's only one.

321
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:04,906
The only way I can move Jae Hee's
heart is through time.

322
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:10,830
When I, who spent 8 years with him,
said I wanted to leave Jae Hee,

323
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:14,473
what would Jae Hee do?

324
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:18,926
Jo Jae Hee ...

325
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,188
Are you testing him?

326
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,392
It's not a test.

327
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,106
I already said I was leaving.
If Jae Hee doesn't try and make me stay...

328
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,422
then, I really will leave.

329
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:17,268
Ah, Director! Welcome.

330
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,429
Wait here for a while.

331
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:30,709
Manager Yun is still not here yet?

332
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,720
She said her grandmother passed away.

333
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:34,694
Then, what should we do?

334
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,662
No matter what there will be a way.

335
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:42,172
When the two of them came up,
they were arguing.

336
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,285
What?

337
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:46,822
He told his wife to quit her job
and just be a housewife.

338
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,663
No matter what they should have
made up before coming here.

339
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:11,427
That...

340
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,839
That... Don't be excited.

341
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:17,829
I'm not excited.

342
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,313
Ah, is that so?

343
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,351
I know, I know.

344
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:26,888
If you want to do it, just continue working,
won't that do?

345
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,150
Doesn't that settle everything? Then...

346
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,717
Not at all.

347
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,409
Letting me continue with my job,
what does that solve then?

348
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:38,319
I do all the housework.

349
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,761
Aren't I helping?

350
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,482
Just lip service.

351
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:45,713
This is really frustrating
Why are you acting this way here?

352
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:47,683
That...

353
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,763
I realized after listening a little,

354
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:55,230
that you have a little misunderstanding
about what he means.

355
00:26:56,464 --> 00:27:01,271
Your husband is saying this because the
family needs a mother's position.

356
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:04,337
That's why he hopes you stay at home.

357
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:12,949
Where you work, is there someone who
recognizes you that way?

358
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:18,290
Isn't it good to stay in a place
which needs you?

359
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:27,170
Rather than go to a job where
you're not essential...

360
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:35,140
Are you saying that I'm a useless
person in my company?

361
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,679
No.

362
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:42,191
Do your household chores well at home,

363
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,785
is that what you mean?

364
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:46,284
No, that's not what I meant.

365
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:51,139
Right from the beginning,
you keep distorting other people's words...

366
00:27:58,284 --> 00:28:00,892
Honey.
Honey!

367
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:04,950
Honey!

368
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:06,407
What should we do?

369
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,960
What should we do, really?!

370
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,720
No matter what there will be a way.

371
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,966
Aigoo, Director!

372
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,770
But this is really difficult.

373
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:26,823
Take a look at this.

374
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:31,397
In the orchestra, the people who play the
violin and the cello have the most lovers...

375
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:32,698
Do you know why?

376
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,382
Just that...

377
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:38,692
Because they sit across
each other like that...

378
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,293
Isn't that interesting?

379
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:42,852
Firstly, when you like each other...

380
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:46,653
you have to keep looking
into each other eyes.

381
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,038
Is Dad in love?

382
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:51,233
I'm telling you so you know.

383
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:58,877
Dad and Yong Shil Unni have been working
together for close to 30 years now, right?

384
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,252
That's so.

385
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:06,912
After working together for so long,
do people come to like each other?

386
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:10,796
Aigoo, what are you saying?

387
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:17,133
My hand is a little slippery.

388
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:25,518
Did I ask a question that was too sensitive?

389
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:27,738
What's with her?

390
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,316
How can men be so stupid?!

391
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:34,429
What?!

392
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:35,816
I don't know!

393
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:43,231
Have you found someone to go with
you to the farewell dinner?

394
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,479
What do you mean found?

395
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,323
Didn't you say spouses had to come along?

396
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:49,627
Hold on.

397
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:51,384
If it's people in the same year as you...

398
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:54,185
then Doctor's ex-fiancÃ©e will come too,
right?

399
00:29:56,523 --> 00:29:57,730
He said he would come?

400
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,561
Then how could you be so calm?

401
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,864
If I don't be calm, what else could I do?

402
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:05,609
But... This is the first time you're meeting
after the break-up, right?

403
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:07,232
Mm.

404
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:10,964
But, you're going by yourself?

405
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:16,131
I'll just dress up really well.
So I don't look sad at all.

406
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,379
I'll lend you the shoes.

407
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,362
You're so cute.

408
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:24,399
If it were me,
I would never go to those sorts of places.

409
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,587
Wha...what's that?

410
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,148
Ahjussi!

411
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:40,089
When... How long have you been their?

412
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:42,544
The farewell dinner.

413
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:47,522
Is Doctor's ex-fiancÃ©e is going too?
From then on.

414
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:57,260
Why do women spend so much
effort on their first love?

415
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,853
I said he was my fiancÃ©e, not my first love.

416
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:06,012
Then... Is there more?

417
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,850
People don't all live like Ahjussi.

418
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,447
How do I live?

419
00:31:12,808 --> 00:31:16,294
Ahjussi. Have you been to a
gathering of some sort?

420
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,614
Why would I go?

421
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:21,920
Have there been gatherings that invited you?

422
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,626
If you attend by yourself,

423
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,029
if it looks a little pathetic at an event
where spouses are invited,

424
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,655
then you should bring Sanggu along.

425
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:05,824
Nobody calls the house. Hold on.

426
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,092
Jo Jae Hee. Are you still there?

427
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,606
Yes.

428
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:42,999
Instead of Sanggu, can you go?

429
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,819
Where?

430
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:49,819
Where else can it be?

431
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,612
How many people will be there?

432
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,876
Quickly tell me.
If you don't want to go, forget it.

433
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,084
They'll bring their kids too, right?

434
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,922
I guess so.

435
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:07,755
How despicable.

436
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:11,158
Forget it.

437
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,176
Oh, what should I do?

438
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:27,440
Why?

439
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:31,496
Uncle is coming back earlier than expected.

440
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,065
Your uncle?

441
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:35,712
Why?

442
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:38,198
This house is Uncle's.

443
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,615
Ah, I see.

444
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,282
Then, what? Do you have to move?

445
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:45,658
I guess so.

446
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:49,491
Ah, I've developed feelings for this house.

447
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:53,214
This neighborhood too, and for Doctor too...

448
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:56,415
Even that Ahjussi.

449
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:01,356
When will he move back in?

450
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,203
He'll move back in three weeks,
so I can slowly start looking for a house.

451
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,582
Then, what can you do?

452
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,239
Which day, what time, where?

453
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:51,367
Since you want to go,
can't you go a little more coolly?

454
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,716
I will go coolly.

455
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,174
Saturday, 7.

456
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,189
Looks like I have to move back to the attic.

457
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,217
Right, Sanggu?

458
00:35:58,905 --> 00:35:59,850
Here.

459
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,012
What are you doing here?

460
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,766
Here, Sanggu!

461
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,169
Sanggu!

462
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,877
You're moving? Mm?

463
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:50,866
It's too late. I saw everything.

464
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:04,462
So what if you like Sanggu?
Is it embarrassing? Ahjussi!

465
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,508
Oh my.

466
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,202
Why did you come to such a far place?

467
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,647
Manager Yun, didn't you come to the
hospital my mother was in?

468
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:51,605
That...

469
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,645
Grandmother...

470
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:57,646
I don't know what words
I can say to comfort you.

471
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:01,623
She was very old too,
and she left peacefully.

472
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,651
- Ki Ran ah, it's been hard on you.
- Ah.

473
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,088
Thank you.

474
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:15,504
How did the meeting go?

475
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,081
Oh, that...

476
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:19,970
It wasn't a big problem.

477
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,011
What a surprise, I was still worried.

478
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:30,453
Incense...
Have you offered some?

479
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:32,703
Yes.

480
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:35,411
I'll send you home.

481
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,268
No, it's fine, forget it.

482
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,420
Where's Hyun Kyu?

483
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,004
He's making a model.

484
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:53,777
We have to prepare the designs,
I'll be back tomorrow?

485
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,874
Really.

486
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,093
<i>Ahead, go straight for 200m.</i>

487
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:05,232
Why does it say go straight?
We should make a right turn.

488
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,387
Really?

489
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,676
Oh, didn't they build a new road here?

490
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:10,929
<i>Ahead, go straight for 100 m.</i>

491
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:14,179
Ah, this ahgassi really.
We should turn right.

492
00:39:14,415 --> 00:39:16,249
Did they build a new road here?

493
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:19,554
Yes, if you wanted to go to Sincheon,
you would take that road.

494
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,160
<i>Go straight ahead, 50 m.</i>

495
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,091
Ah, this ahgassi.

496
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:30,703
Between this ahgassi and me,
who would you trust?

497
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,509
Wah, really.

498
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:43,760
Recharging route.

499
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,962
Aigoo.

500
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:10,396
Thank you. To be able to come
to such a far place.

501
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,576
It's nothing.

502
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:33,174
I'm thinking of accepting the other
company's scout proposal.

503
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,340
Ah.

504
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:43,396
Is that so?

505
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:55,140
Choosing... It's Manager Yun's freedom.

506
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,764
You're not going to stop me?

507
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:07,195
It's a choice that you've made
for your future.

508
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,656
That's true too.

509
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:15,698
Why?

510
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,209
I didn't betray you, right?

511
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,834
I will leave after I handle
the Sun Villa Project.

512
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:40,464
Tomorrow, have a good design meeting, mm?

513
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:43,009
Yes.

514
00:41:57,984 --> 00:41:59,942
Welcome!

515
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,527
Come again soon.

516
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,415
That, customer, you haven't paid!

517
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:43,846
And you left this too!

518
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:10,076
Here.

519
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:11,270
One, two, three.

520
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:12,354
Fighting!

521
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:14,020
Do well!

522
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:17,215
Do well. Be polite.

523
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,729
Although you're the head of the team,
Director Jo,

524
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:22,896
but they are famous architects in
their own right. Understand?

525
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,590
Please respect them.

526
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,062
Ah.

527
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:01,831
What's going on? He's not saying anything.

528
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:12,699
That...

529
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,500
Everyone should take out their
designs and their concepts.

530
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:20,888
Say something.

531
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,555
What can I say?

532
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:29,124
Yes.

533
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:33,545
Everyone just take out your blueprints
and exchange some ideas.

534
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:39,670
Yes, then.

535
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:10,325
This, concept is quite good.

536
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:15,259
Con...con...concept?

537
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:32,422
What does this count as, this?!

538
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:38,456
That... That... Director Park...

539
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,998
That... That... Director Lee...

540
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,329
What do you think you're doing?!

541
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,861
Take this and discuss it.

542
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:19,256
Didn't I tell you to respect them?

543
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:21,354
What did I do?

544
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,048
Have you stood in their shoes
and thought about it?

545
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:28,237
I asked you if you've ever thought about
how it feels to have your work inspected.

546
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:30,515
Then what should I have done?

547
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,153
This is the work that's been produced,
should we just go on like that?

548
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:37,494
Manager, Director has already
chosen his words carefully.

549
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:39,744
It's not to the point where their
designs can be called 'this' right?

550
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:45,147
Then, the Sun Villa that Manager Yun is
talking about is only up to that standard?

551
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:47,647
Isn't it the initial blueprint?

552
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,425
All these were architects that came together
after a lot of hard work.

553
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:51,369
Now, they've all decided to back out.

554
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,022
Then let them back out!

555
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:54,911
Tell them to stop doing it.

556
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:58,786
It's also not necessary for Manager Yun
to wait till this project is over.

557
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:00,578
Let's just call it quits here.

558
00:47:02,717 --> 00:47:04,355
There's no need to continue.

559
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:09,206
Director!

560
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:15,970
What should I do with him?

561
00:47:16,151 --> 00:47:18,053
What can we do?

562
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:21,037
Don't you feel sorry for him?

563
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,217
It's in his blood to be
picky and unreasonable.

564
00:47:24,314 --> 00:47:26,467
If even Manager is not here, what can we do?

565
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:29,818
Have you really decided to leave the firm?

566
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:39,819
Yes.

567
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:43,888
Yes, I know.

568
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,138
Yes.

569
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,238
<i>It's not like that.</i>

570
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:51,927
<i>Then, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

571
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:55,358
<i>Hold on.</i>

572
00:47:56,935 --> 00:47:58,074
<i>Where?</i>

573
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,393
<i>Yes... Yes.</i>

574
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:08,046
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

575
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:10,866
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

576
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:12,255
<i>Yes.</i>

577
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:16,852
That... Manager.

578
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:20,231
Hyun Kyu ah, are you okay?

579
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:23,314
I'm fine.

580
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:25,245
Why were you so careless?

581
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,254
I'll go get the cloth.

582
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:29,079
<i>Oh.</i>

583
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,601
Be careful of the glass.

584
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:36,351
How come the two of you are like that?

585
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,899
[ Sam Su Dong Nicolas Cafe, 6. ]

586
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,440
You're here.

587
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:20,857
Ah.

588
00:49:23,703 --> 00:49:29,009
Ah, that place in Sam Shin Dong called.

589
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,777
They said they wanted to give up on
the new design temporarily.

590
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:37,208
Is that so?

591
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:42,569
Manager Yun is not picking up her call.

592
00:49:43,353 --> 00:49:45,366
What are you going to do?

593
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,922
What can I do? Do your work.

594
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,200
I have to have work before I can do it!

595
00:49:51,297 --> 00:49:52,561
The job at Sam Shin Dong fell through,

596
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,228
and this project with Sun Villa is about
to go down the drain too.

597
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:01,366
Are you really going to
let her go like that?

598
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,519
We'll just hire someone else.

599
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:08,172
Someone else, who?

600
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:11,825
How can there be someone who
can replace Manager Yun?

601
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,409
Things could get very serious.

602
00:50:20,423 --> 00:50:22,701
If there's nothing,
then just get off work. Go!

603
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,591
Manager Yun will really come?

604
00:50:43,994 --> 00:50:46,591
I definitely saw the contents of the note.

605
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:50,605
Is it a appointment with the scout?

606
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,745
A man's sixth sense can be very scary.

607
00:50:54,953 --> 00:50:57,217
This is big.

608
00:50:57,884 --> 00:51:03,120
If this continues, it's a matter of
time before the firm closes.

609
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,682
The firm could just be thrown
off tracks temporarily...

610
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:08,683
Ahjussi is not a bad person either.

611
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:11,879
You're right about the throwing off track.

612
00:51:21,577 --> 00:51:22,577
What?

613
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:24,980
Oh, advertising phone call.

614
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:27,326
Then, why do you look at me?

615
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:28,951
I didn't!

616
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:31,021
Oh.

617
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:48,990
This is a man right?

618
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:54,324
Be honest and tell me.

619
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:56,240
What?

620
00:51:57,804 --> 00:51:59,346
Are you cheating?

621
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:00,359
Ya.

622
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:01,651
Tell me.

623
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:28,284
After the meeting everything fell through...

624
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:29,985
That's all!
Then I just sat there and then came back.

625
00:52:30,423 --> 00:52:33,853
And what kind of person he is,
I don't even remember.

626
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:39,610
Ah. Meeting. Fell through.
Are you a high school student? Eh?

627
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,215
It was something that even high school
students won't attend..

628
00:52:41,216 --> 00:52:42,416
it was a strange atmosphere.

629
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,721
If it wasn't a strange atmosphere,

630
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:47,582
if it weren't strange people,
what were you planning on doing?

631
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:56,607
Ya, then what about you?

632
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:57,663
What about me?

633
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,673
Don't you see yourself as the
centre of everything?

634
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:01,548
When you're busy I can't
even contact you at all.

635
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:04,576
When you want to meet, no matter
how busy I am. I have to go meet you.

636
00:53:05,076 --> 00:53:07,382
That time, because you turned
off your hand phone,

637
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:10,104
I had to wait in front of your
house for three hours.

638
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,076
Ya. On Saturday too,
I waited for your call the whole day.

639
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,645
We made a date to go watch a movie,
but you only called at night,

640
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:19,339
saying something about working all night,
and you only got up.

641
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:22,256
Ya. My life is like that,
do you only know that now, eh?

642
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,978
To what level am I supposed
to understand you?

643
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:33,662
Oh! It's Mun Seok Hwan?

644
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:35,329
What's Mun Seok Hwan?

645
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,890
That person!

646
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:43,515
That Ahjussi..

647
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,376
You know him?

648
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:47,618
He's someone Jae Hee Ahjussi knows.

649
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:48,868
Hold on.

650
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:53,188
Manager Yun.

651
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:57,845
Did you get tired on the way?

652
00:53:57,928 --> 00:53:58,803
No.

653
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:14,549
What?

654
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:19,168
Director. I know where Manager Yun
has been scouted to.

655
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:22,127
Is that so?

656
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:24,391
It's Mun Seok Hwan's firm.

657
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:28,446
Two of them are now meeting in the
Nicolas Cafe in Sam Su Dong.

658
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,041
Envelope!

659
00:54:31,236 --> 00:54:33,666
Oh, that's a contract right?

660
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,875
They look like they're about
to sign a contract!

661
00:54:37,347 --> 00:54:38,944
What are you going to do? Eh?

662
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:39,986
Hurry!

663
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:41,352
Forget it!

664
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:47,769
Oh, I'm about to leave now.
I'll see you there.

665
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:59,082
Why are you here?
Didn't we agree to meet outside?

666
00:55:00,137 --> 00:55:02,068
I'm a little dizzy.

667
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,558
Sit down.

668
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:17,753
I ate some food,
but my stomach is a little unwell.

669
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:19,295
Have you vomited?

670
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:22,115
I feel like I'm about to.

671
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,976
What's going on,
you're even breaking a cold sweat.

672
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:29,142
Sometimes, these are symptoms of flu.

673
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:31,281
I'll take a look at your neck.

674
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:34,517
Open your mouth. Ah.

675
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:37,989
Ah.

676
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,822
What's wrong with you?

677
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:48,669
Did something happen?

678
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,783
It's Yun Ki Ran, right?

679
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:05,754
Is she going to a different company?

680
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:15,978
If I want to build houses,
I need Manager Yun.

681
00:56:29,436 --> 00:56:31,423
Then hold on to her.

682
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,548
Now, what can I do?

683
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,964
What do you mean, now?

684
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:41,756
It...

685
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:44,756
Might be too late already.

686
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,358
If it's a person who has to exist in
Jo Jae Hee's life,

687
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:54,650
shouldn't you hold on to her?

688
00:56:56,882 --> 00:56:59,521
If Yun Ki Ran leaves and
you can't build houses,

689
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:03,340
and you're showing symptoms of dizziness,
and you want to vomit when you eat,

690
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,229
won't that always be the case?

691
00:57:28,632 --> 00:57:31,245
I'll calculate the time right, and be there.

692
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:33,870
No, you don't have to...

693
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,870
Be there.

694
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,596
Taxi!

695
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:18,244
Why is he not picking up his phone, really!

696
00:58:24,494 --> 00:58:30,436
Our Manager Yun,
is quicker than I imagined. It's good.

697
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,013
Here.

698
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,347
<i>It looks like she's about to sign.</i>

699
00:58:43,027 --> 00:58:46,147
Ah, really. Looks like there is no time.

700
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:48,133
<i>Ah, Ahjussi!</i>

701
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,188
Eh?

702
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:50,799
Where?

703
00:58:50,952 --> 00:58:52,230
Director?!

704
00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:19,773
Really...

705
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,859
No matter how I look at it.
It seems like a bad atmosphere.

706
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,396
No, it's not.

707
01:00:05,366 --> 01:00:08,768
So you mean, the place you're going to,
is Mun Seok Hwan's?

708
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:11,352
Is that not okay?

709
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:17,252
Working with Mun Seok Hwan,
what benefits do you get?

710
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:22,418
Didn't you ask me to go?
What does it matter where I go?

711
01:00:23,641 --> 01:00:24,710
Ah...

712
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,249
Don't go.

713
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:23,708
They are really good conditions.

714
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:28,458
The salary is good,
the benefits are good too.

715
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,301
Manager Yun and I...

716
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:36,857
We...

717
01:01:37,384 --> 01:01:38,343
Really...

718
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:41,100
There are many people we can work with.

719
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:48,100
Perhaps it's that way for Manager Yun.
But the only person I can work with,

720
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,563
Is Manager Yun.

721
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:05,408
If my works cannot be presented anymore,
wouldn't that be a waste?

722
01:02:10,568 --> 01:02:11,484
Ah.

723
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,568
It's not that.

724
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:17,311
Okay.

725
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:19,297
I'll think about it.

726
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:27,381
What you mean is that, you need me in order
to continue creating your works. Right?

727
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:30,769
Then, what about me?

728
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:34,700
What can you do for me?

729
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:39,357
To create my works, doesn't
Manager Yun like that too?

730
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:48,439
You're saying that you wish to keep me
by your side as a partner, right?

731
01:02:51,078 --> 01:02:52,703
If Manager Yun...

732
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,466
Wishes too.

733
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,466
Just like now.

734
01:03:09,426 --> 01:03:11,718
Like that, there's no way
I can be satisfied.

735
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:19,412
Ah, is that so?
He's with Yun Ki Ran, right now?

736
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:23,426
Yes, they're discussing something
important right now.

737
01:03:23,663 --> 01:03:25,496
Are you looking for Director
about something?

738
01:03:26,288 --> 01:03:29,232
Ah, no. You've worked hard.

739
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:25,507
I'm sorry.

740
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:39,716
I can't take it, even with your apology.

741
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:44,146
Doctor Jang.

742
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:46,688
Doctor Jang.

743
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:48,854
Doctor Jang.

744
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,560
I told you. You don't have
to come anymore.

745
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:52,961
Why do you always keep people
waiting for you?

746
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:56,819
Then, now let's go to where
the gathering is.

747
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,860
It's fine even if we don't go.

748
01:04:58,527 --> 01:04:59,958
Doctor Jang.

749
01:05:10,455 --> 01:05:11,872
Do your feet hurt?

750
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,747
Wait.

757
01:05:39,723 --> 01:05:41,667
I'm so angry, I'm going crazy.

758
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:46,945
I'm angry,
upset.

759
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,362
- I'm sorry.
- Didn't I tell you not to apologize?

760
01:05:57,737 --> 01:05:59,807
Why do you keep moving me?

761
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:02,178
Yes?

762
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:04,817
You keep giving me expectations,

763
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,275
but in the end this happens.

764
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:09,595
I wait by myself, I get hurt by myself.

765
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:12,282
Once I'm angry, you chase up to me again.

766
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:19,574
If I push you aside, you run to the
consultation room to sit.

767
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:23,345
When Jo Jae Hee smiles like a child,
I feel released again.

768
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:25,276
I hate this.

769
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:33,052
I've started to like you.

770
01:06:33,149 --> 01:06:35,482
<i>Maybe our relationship will always
be entwined, and never end, but I...</i>

771
01:06:35,607 --> 01:06:36,885
I'm very...

772
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,871
I'm very mad about that.
