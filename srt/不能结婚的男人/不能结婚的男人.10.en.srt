Episode 10

4
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,350
I'd like to show those things...

5
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:11,417
to you, Dr. Jang.

6
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:14,115
What things?

7
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:16,363
Food from the sea,

8
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,173
the character of a romantic landscape,

9
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:24,819
the work I do.

10
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:32,587
U- um...

11
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:33,577
Just a minute.

12
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:35,264
Please, listen.

13
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:40,563
In your decision to go or not,
this is very important.

14
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,618
Go ahead.

15
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:57,004
We'll be using separate rooms.

16
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:05,912
<i>{\a6}What do you need love for?</i>

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,389
<i>{\a6}It's just inconvenient.</i>

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,633
<i>{\a6}That's the way I lived till now.</i>

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,334
<i>{\a6}But, strangely,</i>

20
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,308
<i>{\a6}this is a real surprise.</i>

21
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:25,910
<i>{\a6}Without my knowing,
a smile is on my face.</i>

22
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:31,103
<i>{\a6}I want to love.</i>

23
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>{\a6}I want to try out love.</i>

24
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,124
<i>{\a6}This feeling of mine,</i>

25
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,849
<i>{\a6}I just can't stop.</i>

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,430
<i>{\a6}I want to try out loving
the man that's you.</i>

27
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:58,537
Going on a vacation with someone is?

28
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,965
Can't we turn the music down?

29
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:20,888
This music has to be listened to at 38.

30
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,346
I can't...

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,097
I can't hear you talking.

32
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:34,678
Aye, tch. You don't drive.

33
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,863
You don't marry.

34
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,190
You don't lie, and you don't compromise.

35
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,999
Aren't there a bit too many
things you don't do?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,815
Those are all things you need
as you go on in life.

37
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,518
That is your opinion.

38
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:59,245
It's a right turn at the big road.

39
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:03,737
Uh?

40
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,753
We're in a convertible.

41
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,983
Convertibles are for following the wind.

42
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:13,355
A convertible is just a car
which top opens up.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,589
Huh! Right! To the right!

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,187
The right, to the right...

45
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:25,139
Ahh, so nice...

46
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,886
Dr. Jang!

47
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:33,653
Ahh, still won't answer his phone.

48
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,757
Aigoo. He's on vacation.

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,848
I told him to keep his phone on in
case something urgent came up.

50
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,372
Did something urgent come up?

51
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,461
We have to meet with the county
magistrate for a briefing,

52
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,462
and he says he only has time tomorrow.

53
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:48,352
Then, what'll we do?

54
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,141
Mun Seok Hwan has agreed to go down instead.

55
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:54,540
Uh, I'm all finished with the documents.

56
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,587
You don't know where Jae Hee
has gone, either, do you?

57
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,204
I don't know.

58
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,965
All right.

59
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,982
I'll be back.

60
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,746
Don't mess around just
because no one's here.

61
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,097
Boy, do I wish I could.

62
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:12,718
You stacked a ton of work on me.

63
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,074
Have a good trip.

64
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,507
I'm off.

65
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:15,569
Okay.

66
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,727
Now that we've followed the wind,

67
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,024
are you satisfied?

68
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,447
This...

69
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,819
and you don't even know the roads...

70
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:55,701
Dr. Jang!

71
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:57,981
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:00,212
The breeze was so nice...

73
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,165
I've had so much of this ocean breeze,

74
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,621
that there's salt in my hair!

75
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,695
What should we do?

76
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,908
Why don't you ask the ocean breeze?

77
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,212
Now I'll do everything you ask.

78
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:20,330
Really?

79
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,710
Yes.

80
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,208
Then,

81
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,231
let's go north. Just north.

82
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:26,450
North?

83
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,882
- Ah!
- North.

84
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:32,344
For just one meal, can we eat separately?

85
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:33,944
What?

86
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:39,708
You can eat what you want, and I...

87
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,835
Let's go.

88
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:29,485
If you wanted to come here so badly,
you should have said something earlier.

89
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:32,730
You said you don't eat sashimi.

90
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:35,349
Did you used to come all the
way here to eat sashimi?

91
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,222
By yourself?

92
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,046
Jo Jae Hee,

93
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,388
going on vacation with someone...

94
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,756
is this your first time?

95
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:52,198
Well, is there a reason you
need to go with someone?

96
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:56,190
Have you never had a girlfriend?

97
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:58,911
Excuse me?

98
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,828
If you had a girlfriend,

99
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,727
wouldn't you have gone
on vacations with her?

100
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,465
Dr. Jang,

101
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,123
then have you gone on
vacations with boyfriends?

102
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:14,787
Of course.

103
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:21,804
With... that fiancÃ©e?

104
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:28,471
Here, the fish is out.

105
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,572
Here we go.

106
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:37,215
This is... because you don't like sashimi.

107
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,069
people that don't like sashimi

108
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>wrap it in this, and then enjoy it.</i>

109
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,471
<i>Try it out.</i>

110
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,066
Please eat.

111
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,687
Shall I wrap it in this?

112
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,067
I don't really like sashimi.

113
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,724
Like this?

114
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:20,867
Mmm. It's good.

115
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:36,670
Is this what you were talking
to the lady about?

116
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:37,882
Well...

117
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:44,703
What?

118
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,053
Yeah, Yu Jin.

119
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,337
Are you done?

120
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,066
No, not yet.

121
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:57,622
Yah... Because the manager and director
aren't here, it's totally my world.

122
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:00,534
Hey. I'm off tomorrow.
Do you want to come with me?

123
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:02,657
Tomorrow?

124
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,291
Sorry, but I'm doing something
with Su Young tomorrow.

125
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,321
Really?

126
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,539
What are you doing?

127
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,767
Can't I come along?

128
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,684
No, you can't!

129
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:18,801
Hey. If it's no, it's no.
Why are you yelling?

130
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:22,561
Who's yelling?

131
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:27,776
Are you really not going to tell
me what you guys are doing?

132
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:32,192
Ah, uh, that's... oh,
a customer has come in.

133
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,453
Gotta go.

134
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:34,608
Hey, are you really going to be like this?

135
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:35,599
Hey!

136
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,303
Aish...

137
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,008
Hey, come over here.

138
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:46,227
Hey, you really can't ask
me that kind of favor.

139
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:48,387
I'm sorry, friend.

140
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,753
But what are friends for?

141
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:55,431
A meeting* member getting enteritis**
isn't my fault, isn't it?

142
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:55,431
<i>{\a6}(*blind date; **Inflamtion of the intestine)</i>

143
00:09:55,467 --> 00:10:00,080
And, it's not like I could pass up
the rare meeting opportunity.

144
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,169
Thank you, friend.

145
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,277
I'll pay you back, big. Big.

146
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,739
Oh! But, if Hyun Kyu finds out,
it's be a disaster.

147
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,956
Hey, but who knows?

148
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:14,576
You may meet someone way
better than Hyun Kyu.

149
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:17,476
They say they work at a
hot venture start-up.

150
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:20,110
I'm just filling a seat.

151
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,817
Aaaaye, really?

152
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:22,766
Truly?

153
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:23,886
Really? Huh?

154
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,560
You!

155
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:29,954
Firstly,

156
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:34,806
once you get your feet in the water,
the next step is waiting.

157
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,948
Waiting.

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,384
<i>I'm...</i>

159
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,446
<i>not me.</i>

160
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,493
<i>I'm a fish.</i>

161
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,965
So that even the fish
will mistakenly think so.

162
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:54,024
Wait... and wait again.

163
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,663
<i>Me...</i>

164
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:57,220
<i>and the fish...</i>

165
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,383
<i>and the water.</i>

166
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,752
<i>Three in one.</i>

167
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,265
We're waiting.

168
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,415
We're waiting.

169
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,448
<i>We're one.</i>

170
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,183
<i>We're waiting.</i>

171
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:13,583
They've come!

172
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,685
They've come! They've come,
they've come...

173
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:19,532
Oh, here, no there, there...

174
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,250
Now, why?

175
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,267
Why so serious?

176
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,676
People all just come splash
around and catch these things.

177
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:36,507
Then... are you going to
catch them in this section?

178
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:41,042
Why? Are you planning to leave
me and go to another section?

179
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:44,154
No, well...

180
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,775
Ohhh, look at those conflicted eyes.

181
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,826
Tch. When, I'm dressed
like this and got all wet.

182
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:53,274
Ah, why did you dress like this.

183
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,841
Unbelievable.

184
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,505
I wanna go.

185
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,438
Wait.

186
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,462
Since we came all the way here,

187
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,504
we have to catch at least one.

188
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,655
Now, watch me carefully. This way.

189
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,958
Did the move go okay?

190
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,905
They took it all. It was chaotic.

191
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:36,921
Grandma, are you not in pain anymore?

192
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,020
Yeah, after sending your uncle on vacation,

193
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,063
your grandmother has become quite spunky.

194
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,027
You'll say anything in front of a child.

195
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,303
Mother-in-law,

196
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:50,379
I've scheduled a date for the surgery.

197
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,065
Why so rushed?

198
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:55,141
I've only confirmed they've left.

199
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,709
If something happens along the way,
the surgery is off.

200
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,300
What kind of deal is that?!

201
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,861
This kind.

202
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:05,840
Why should I schedule my surgery when
who knows if they're having a good

203
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:07,341
time or splitting apart?

204
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,845
Are you not going to get surgery
and just continue using it as bait?

205
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,357
Frankly, you don't want the surgery, do you?

206
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:17,044
You... no, it's not like that.

207
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,582
Why'd you pick such a hard
place to pitch a tent.

208
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,566
Can't we move up there?

209
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:35,337
The reason I chose this spot,
you'll see when you sleep.

210
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,568
How do I do this?

211
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:44,214
Aye. What are you doing?

212
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,598
You have to fasten the middle first.

213
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,390
And connect it with that piece.

214
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:54,838
I'm not your employee or anything.

215
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,503
You've been really over
the top since earlier.

216
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:01,862
We're trading tents.

217
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:05,777
I'd like to sleep in a house
built by Jo Jae Hee.

218
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,130
Let's see how strong and sturdy it is.

219
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:11,414
Oh! Yeah! It's nice.

220
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,419
Some nerve...

221
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,431
What's in this bag? It's so big.

222
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:16,803
Uh! Don't touch it!

223
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:20,255
- Don't touch it!
- Oh my.

224
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,545
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,164
Do you really hate it that much...
when people touch your stuff?

226
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,193
Oh! You can't!

227
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:15,111
Currently, what is their situation?

228
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:21,504
I have an eyewitness who says they
left Friday morning at 10 with large bags.

229
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,940
Ah, is that so?

230
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:28,217
According to the eyewitness...

231
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:34,895
Ahhh, earlier, they took these
gigantic bags and went that way.

232
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:40,209
She reported that she saw Jo Jae Hee
who looked very excited.

233
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,146
He didn't come last night.

234
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:46,564
And, he always takes out 6 on the weekends.

235
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:49,385
And the lady didn't come either.

236
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:52,581
But, what's this about?

237
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:59,286
And a very nosy witness reported
that they didn't come into a

238
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,287
shop where they're regulars.

239
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:05,955
It seems that at least they
have actually gone.

240
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:09,228
Shall we... give them a call?

241
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,198
Aigoo, no, no.

242
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,218
It's about sunset right now,
perfect for setting the mood.

243
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,465
Don't interrupt them.

244
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:18,874
Yes, come again.

245
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:21,057
- Goodbye.
- Yes, Goodbye.

246
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:26,299
Okay, let's give it a good shot.

247
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,323
A good shot.

248
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,290
Please sit.

249
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,516
Thank you.

250
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:29,465
How pretty.

251
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:39,932
Just a minute.

252
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:23,206
Ah, you have to spray it now
so there's time for the bugs die

253
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:24,807
and the smell to clear.

254
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,574
Greek Salad Caprice, orange dressing.

255
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:37,162
This is really fabulous.

256
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:46,742
There are a lot of stars out.

257
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:51,795
Now...

258
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,753
Manseh! (Korean cheer signified
by 2 arms raised)

259
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,227
Shall I...

260
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,866
<i>Do you hear the sounds?</i>

261
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:16,519
It's okay. Don't worry about me,
and just move around.

262
00:20:19,938 --> 00:20:22,063
No, not me.

263
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:24,086
The sound of the pebbles
under the crashing waves.

264
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,787
Ahh.

265
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,369
Yes, I can hear it.

266
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:36,790
<i>It's nice.</i>

267
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,200
Did you pitch the tents here...
to listen to that sound?

268
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:52,526
Yes.

269
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,771
It's nice.

270
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,964
Goodnight.

271
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,280
Goodnight.

272
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:35,956
The business people seem satisfied,
don't you think?

273
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:36,840
Mmm.

274
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:39,710
So, now after we formally
meet with the council later,

275
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,367
the procedural dance is roughly over.

276
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,686
Thank you, Director Mun.

277
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,113
Thanks to you, we're getting
over each milestone.

278
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,102
Shhh...

279
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:52,659
Ah, let's see. Shall we pop over and
take a look at the site before we go?

280
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,808
Picking the design with this architect
group, I saw quite a lot of

281
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,109
interesting designs.

282
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:00,900
I'm leaving it in your hands to
manage the architects' opinions.

283
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:04,392
Don't you worry. I know how to treat people.

284
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:08,623
Ahhhh, I should have gotten an MA.

285
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:17,932
Do we have to walk a lot?

286
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,773
Why? You don't like to walk?

287
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:22,174
No, I just wanted to change into sneakers.

288
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,430
All right.

289
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,431
Oh, feel the humidity.
The humidity. Oooh.

290
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:04,010
Oh, he's still not answering his phone.

291
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:04,786
Leave him alone.

292
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,359
If you bug him when he's relaxing,
he'll be irritated.

293
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,996
Wow, finding a car like this here...

294
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,227
This, this, this...

295
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:14,408
looks like someone's here to seduce a woman.

296
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,187
Shall we see?

297
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,194
Aaahh, the synergy is weak.

298
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,347
No way, he'll get this woman.
I'll bet 10 bucks.

299
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:29,808
Aigoo, he'll be working hard, working hard.

300
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,345
Let's go.

301
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,175
Wow.

302
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,611
The height of those window sills over there,

303
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:42,614
and the height of the wainscot,
do you know their meaning?

304
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,441
What's a wainscot?

305
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:47,981
Ah, you see the wood that lies
crosswise under the window frame?

306
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,864
Ah, that one that spreads like this?

307
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,895
Yes, that's called a wainscot.

308
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:52,799
Mmm.

309
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,189
When this Wando project is over,

310
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:59,243
how about coming over to me.

311
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,439
You don't even answer anymore?

312
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:07,410
Aigoo, what a hot day.

313
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:14,999
Look at that...

314
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,558
What's this? Must be a kitchen.

315
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,849
It's a storeroom.

316
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,428
Ahhh.

317
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,093
Are you protecting all these houses?

318
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:24,909
So cool.

319
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,156
Mmm.

320
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,788
This too?

321
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,439
Then, there's three?

322
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:34,238
This place has a particularly
pretty detached house.

323
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,637
Dr. Jang, I'm sorry.

324
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,289
Oh my! Aah!

325
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,133
Oh my! Jae Hee!

326
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,157
What are you doing here?

327
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:57,614
<i>Aigoo, we couldn't contact you,
and here you were.</i>

328
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,463
<i>Contact? For what?</i>

329
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,720
We just met with the business
team for a briefing.

330
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,867
Director Mun took on your responsibilities.

331
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,631
Ah, really?

332
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:11,594
But, what are you doing here?

333
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,243
<i>Ah, I wanted to check it
out and get some ideas.</i>

334
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,827
Are you addicted to work?

335
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:23,448
You take vacation time to do this?

336
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:25,820
I have to take a look around,

337
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:26,941
so go on.

338
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:31,264
No, since we're here, we should
take a look around and talk.

339
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:33,597
- Huh?
- Right, let's check in out.

340
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,949
Manager Yoon!

341
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:36,897
Leave first!

342
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,393
Let's look around together.

343
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:40,351
I want to be alone.

344
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,914
Do you really have to reveal
your quirks in a place like this?

345
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:48,749
Aigoo.

346
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,745
Okay, all right.

347
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,349
We'll leave now,

348
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,673
but later, we have an important
meeting with the council.

349
00:25:55,674 --> 00:25:59,976
Ah, and you really must come
to the congratulatory party.

350
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,244
I'm busy.

351
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,767
Someone hanging out in a place
like this alone? How busy?

352
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:09,711
Since we've run into you, you better come
because it's somewhere you need to be.

353
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:11,691
I'll see later.

354
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:12,956
Now get going.

355
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,909
It's at the Hanolim Pension.

356
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,200
You better come.

357
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,167
<I>Jae Hee,

358
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,252
Director Mun came all the way down here
and dealt with this because of us.

359
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:25,553
Don't you feel a bit sorry?

360
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:26,763
Huh?

361
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:31,218
No, it's not an issue of being sorry.
It's an issue of being responsible.

362
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,446
Okay, all right.

363
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:36,587
Hey, your phone.

364
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,163
Keep it on.

365
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,801
I turned it on. Now go, go.

366
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,517
Aigoo.

367
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,451
He's a research subject,
a real research subject.

368
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:31,289
Dr. Jang.

369
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,234
Dr... Dr. Jang

370
00:27:33,577 --> 00:27:34,513
Are they gone.

371
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:35,637
Yes, they're gone.

372
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:41,648
What are you going to do?

373
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,237
I'll just go up to Seoul?

374
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:52,274
Excuse me?

375
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:56,043
Aigoo. We could have looked together,
but he always does that.

376
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,595
Is Director Jo normally like that?

377
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,652
Really eccentric...

378
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,244
<i>Whoa, these seat colors
are really eccentric.</i>

379
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
It's work. You should go.

380
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:23,061
But, there's still a lot of time left.

381
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:28,009
Aye. What'll you do if we're going
around and run into them?

382
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:37,118
If you really want to go back...

383
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:42,078
There's no choice, is there?

384
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:57,621
Manager Yun.

385
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:05,464
I heard Dr. Jang is down here too.

386
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:08,458
Dr. Jang Mun Jung?

387
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,256
And so?

388
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,286
Ah, never mind.

389
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,095
If you by chance connect with her,

390
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:23,446
why don't you ask her to stay with us?

391
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,778
Jae Hee.

392
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,449
- Wear this tonight.
- Why?

393
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,669
<i>No matter how practical you are,
it's a briefing.</i>

394
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,270
<i>Are you going to go like that?</i>

395
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:03,387
You seemed to have lost weight
these days, so I bought one size down.

396
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:05,471
And shoes.

397
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,426
Office wife.

398
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,821
Someone who, at least in the office,
has a more intimate relationship

399
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,722
than the actual spouse...

400
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:22,522
the colleague of the opposite sex.

401
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:26,686
Who are you?

402
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,284
Ah.

403
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,428
You are a doctor.

404
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,285
The antiseptic smell is stronger
than any cologne.

405
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:38,778
I'm Mun Seok Hwan.

406
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:42,834
Shall we shake hands?

407
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,329
Hello.

408
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,046
You came?

409
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:01,410
Hello.

410
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:02,738
Yes.

411
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:10,177
We have some free time.
Shall we go see the ocean?

412
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,910
Shall we go?

413
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,353
Ah, my body's been really tired lately.

414
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:36,447
It's probably not some big disease, right?

415
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,522
Are you sleeping okay at night?

416
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,174
Aigoo, I can't sleep at all.

417
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:45,293
A 43 year old bachelor's night.

418
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:48,152
Even thinking about it is
depressing, isn't it?

419
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:51,145
Sounds like Director Mun is continuing
to meet with architectural groups

420
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:52,646
and listening to ideas.

421
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,984
- So, after we get up to Seoul...
- That, that, that...

422
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:57,626
Aye, that...

423
00:31:57,627 --> 00:31:59,085
And, also...

424
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:03,066
these days, my body feels really feverish.

425
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:07,312
Would you mind feeling the temperature?

426
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:09,291
Here.

427
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:10,335
Oh.

428
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:15,136
Oh, I'll...

429
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:16,577
Manager Yun!

430
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,927
Me?

431
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,946
Uh? Ohhhh. You're good.

432
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:26,057
Fine.

433
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,007
It's coming back!

434
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,104
Throw it hard.

435
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,059
- Uh!
- Oh!

436
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,900
<i>Are you okay?</i>

437
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,443
I'm sorry.

438
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,547
Give it a...

439
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,443
Let me give it a toss.

440
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:03,321
Don't worry. I've played
some ball in my day.

441
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,821
Okay, catch!

442
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:09,526
Give it, give it here.

443
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,661
Okay. So, you want to take me on, do you?

444
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,950
High five!

445
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:22,277
All right, here it comes.

446
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,359
Oh no!

447
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,707
- Dr. Jang!
- Dr. Jang!

448
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,605
Are you okay?

449
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:42,000
Dr. Jang, are you okay?

450
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,750
Let me see, let me see.

451
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,113
Oh! That... blood...

452
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,383
Aigoo! Oh dear!

453
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,420
<i>Aigoo. Aye!</i>

454
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,729
Are you okay?

455
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,298
Do I look okay?

456
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,157
What kind of person does that?

457
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:34,717
It was an accident...

458
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,036
Oh?

459
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:41,984
Why'd you ask me to come
on vacation with you?

460
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:47,529
I wanted to show these things
and places to you, Dr. Jang.

461
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,809
I split my lip,

462
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,442
and I'm the one who had to drive.

463
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,489
I got chewed out trying to catch a fish.

464
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,329
And when I got pushed at the hanok*
village... (traditional Korean home)

465
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,430
just look at these bruises.

466
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:01,423
I'm sorry.

467
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,496
This is what my mood looks like right now.

468
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:11,428
As it is, I'm feeling awkward stuck
in the midst of strangers...

469
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:13,094
<i>Jae Hee.</i>

470
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,359
Huh?

471
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:17,673
Go on.

472
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,444
<i>Jae Hee, let's go.</i>

473
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,986
She's calling you. Go on.

474
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,601
Yes, well, then...

475
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:38,909
We're late now.

476
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,870
Yeah, let's go.

477
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,554
Uh? Where were you?

478
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:46,071
I was in my room.

479
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:47,973
Try to be on time.

480
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:49,648
Oh, fits well. Let's go.

481
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:51,825
What about Dr. Jang?

482
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,008
Who knows?

483
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,666
Practice what you learned today.

484
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,241
Yes, we will.

485
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:07,963
Thank you.

486
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,640
Is it not going well?

487
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:22,562
Do you think it would go
well on the first day?

488
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:26,098
This is really no easy task.

489
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:28,207
It's a good thing.

490
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,527
Since you've started anyway,
just dive into it,

491
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:32,402
and don't think about Mun Jung.

492
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:35,977
Forget the music, I can't even make a sound.

493
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:39,858
But, what have you decided to learn?

494
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:42,572
For me... the piano.

495
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,655
You think your hands can handle it?

496
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:22,064
You know how to play the piano?

497
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:26,352
What do you know?
My hands seem to remember.

498
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,810
Before I went off the school,
I lived quite a long time at home.

499
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:35,057
Our house was the only one in
the neighborhood with a piano.

500
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,272
Play some more.

501
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:38,869
Yes, sir!

502
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,562
Hello.

503
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,134
Hello.

504
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,517
Do you have flounder too?

505
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:09,578
Yes, we do.

506
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,131
Do you want a big one?

507
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,131
Yes.

508
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:32,317
Regarding storage,

509
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,357
there are 3 major types,

510
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,853
DAS, NAS, and SAN.

511
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:38,425
Of those, our company

512
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:43,014
is creating a hardware that can
converge SAN storage and NAS gateway

513
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,944
After it's inputted, a kernel software
can be used to develop a file protocol.

514
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:47,858
Combining UNIX and NT servers.

515
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,618
In an IT environment,

516
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:52,150
you'll be able to get easy access to data
and manage them. It's also easy to install.

517
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:56,738
This data management would be specially created
to provide a way for file transfer protocol

518
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:01,324
If this becomes a great success,
our company will register to KOSDAQ.

519
00:38:57,325 --> 00:39:00,325
<i>{\a6}(*Korean Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations)</i>

520
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:04,952
And then the girls will line up and follow.

521
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:08,745
If that happens, you'll ask
us out on a date, won't you?

522
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:19,317
But, this kind of talk is no fun, right?

523
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:21,113
Right.

524
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:25,586
Then shall I tell you an interesting story?

525
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:26,978
Yes.

526
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:34,400
Did you know that Rain was initially
going to be a member of Big Bang?

527
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,356
Really?

528
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:37,711
Then why didn't he join?

529
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:44,637
To avoid Tae Yang
(Tae Yang means the sun)

530
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:51,877
To avoid Tae Yang.

531
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,729
No matter how he runs...

532
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,411
- C'mon yo!
- Yo, wow, wow...

533
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,989
Truly would like to avoid...

534
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:04,483
<i>What this, this is really touching.</i>

535
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:06,443
The work was perfectly neat.

536
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:08,297
And, the food was perfect,

537
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:11,888
all except for the spicy fish stew.

538
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:19,951
Um, it looks somewhat...

539
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:22,203
It's better than before.

540
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,943
Now then, let's toast again.

541
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,207
- Okay, then, cheers.
- Cheers.

542
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:35,471
There.

543
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:40,369
I will concoct a poktanju.
(Beer with a shot of hard liquor)

544
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,053
Ta da!

545
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:48,488
Ah, the mood is good tonight,

546
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,780
and the air is good.

547
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,576
Why don't we go around
and play the Truth game?

548
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:56,302
What do you think about the Truth game?

549
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,910
Truth game, whatever...

550
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:05,255
Because there's a woman here
who's thoughts I'd like to know.

551
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:12,858
Excuse me?

552
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,615
I'm not playing.

553
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:16,644
Then stay out.

554
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,767
I don't want to play, either.

555
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,169
Ah, that won't do.

556
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,571
There can only be one person
from this group that stays out.

557
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:24,257
That's the rule.

558
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:27,864
Unless Director Jo wants
to play instead of you.

559
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,297
What the...

560
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:32,212
What kind of lame rule is that?

561
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:34,384
I'm in. Let's play.

562
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,695
<I>Okay.

563
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,328
The 2 of you, decide.

564
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:41,937
I'm not playing.

565
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:47,833
Okay, Dr. Jang is in. Director Jo,
you may not speak one word.

566
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,858
What, that's my liberty.

567
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:51,870
No, it's not.

568
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:54,896
Director Jo, if you say one word,

569
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:57,035
then you're obligated to
answer one question.

570
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,502
Everybody okay with that?

571
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:00,218
- Okay.
- Okay.

572
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,236
This is life with a group.

573
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:09,402
Understand?

574
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,113
So then, I will spin the bottle.

575
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:17,744
Now, I'm spinning.

576
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,907
- Hey!
- Eh?

577
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,943
What kind of move is that?

578
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:26,463
What kind? This kind.

579
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:29,769
The person holding the bottle
can do whatever he likes.

580
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,155
Unbelievable.

581
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:37,226
Go on and ask.

582
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:46,067
Was there someone that you've truly loved?

583
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:53,259
Yes, there was.

584
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:57,257
Ohhhh. Now, your turn, Dr. Jang.

585
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,445
Okay.

586
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:05,557
- Out!
- Eh?

587
00:43:05,558 --> 00:43:07,387
The spin landed on you.

588
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:08,897
How now?

589
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:12,984
Would you like take a question and a spin?

590
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:16,216
Do it.

591
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:18,087
Oh, this is fun.

592
00:43:22,657 --> 00:43:23,549
Okay, then.

593
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,647
So, if the spin lands out again,
then the spin will come back to me.

594
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:30,995
Now, I'm spinning.

595
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:36,138
Oh, now what?

596
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:37,792
The spin lands on Manager Yun!

597
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:42,690
I have 3 questions for you, Manager Yun.
You pick, number 1, 2, or 3.

598
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:44,282
Number 2.

599
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:45,875
Okay, number 2.

600
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:52,705
Do you have any thoughts of leaving
Director Jo's architectural firm?

601
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,204
Uhh...

602
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:07,358
if I feel like I've been
betrayed my Director Jo,

603
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,854
then I'll quit.

604
00:44:10,086 --> 00:44:12,476
Betrayed?

605
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:23,033
Now then...

606
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:25,173
Manager Yun, spin.

607
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:34,782
- Uh?
- The sping goes to Dr. Jang!

608
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:40,587
Is there a man you like right now?

609
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,711
I'm not sure.

610
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:52,017
<i>Uh, uh. Either there is or there isn't.</i>

611
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,115
There's no "I'm not sure".

612
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:04,903
No comment.

613
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:09,973
Ohhhhh, that means there is.

614
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,171
I just need to drink, right?

615
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,605
That's right. One shot. All.

616
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:29,197
Whahoa. Now, Dr. Jang, take a spin.

617
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:35,808
Out!

618
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,243
According to our last rule,
I'll spin again, huh?

619
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:40,990
Here I go.

620
00:45:45,223 --> 00:45:46,680
<i>Out!</i>

621
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:52,669
If there are 3 outs, you have
to answer one question.

622
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,965
- Okay?
- Okay.

623
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:08,427
Mmm, Director Jo, what is your ideal woman?

624
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,368
Mona Lisa.

625
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,499
Honey?

626
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,852
If we take the young radish
kimchi from my parents

627
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:38,991
and introduce cooked rice into the equation,

628
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:43,142
wouldn't we perfect a radish
kimchi bibimbab system?

629
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:45,233
Ha!

630
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,823
And what about introducing
sesame oil and a fried egg?

631
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:49,365
Don't forget it.

632
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:54,837
But still, it looked like
they'd earn good money.

633
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,535
Uh, how's Hyun Kyu's income?

634
00:46:58,536 --> 00:47:00,563
How can you ask something like that?

635
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,205
You haven't looked into it?

636
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:04,779
Hey, we're not kids anymore.

637
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,864
And didn't you say you wanted
to get married quickly?

638
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:10,285
That's true, but...

639
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,718
Uh? Who could that be?

640
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:17,535
Who is it?

641
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:21,705
Yu Jin!

642
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:25,197
Why haven't you been answering
your phone? I was worried!

643
00:47:25,198 --> 00:47:29,830
Uh, uh, the phone, that, well...

644
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:32,886
Hello.

645
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,651
Hello, Soo Young.

646
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:40,958
Let's go in.

647
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,422
Yu Jin,

648
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:54,943
No matter what, you must
carry around that alarm. Huh?

649
00:47:55,435 --> 00:48:00,252
Since your phone was off, all sorts
of thoughts went through my head.

650
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:02,653
Okay, I will.

651
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:08,549
Hyun Kyu, what are your
plans around marriage?

652
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,529
Eh?

653
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,794
Hey!

654
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:11,949
Yes?

655
00:48:15,443 --> 00:48:17,969
Well, first, I need to
establish myself at work,

656
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,844
and save quite a bit of money.

657
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:23,057
After that, I guess.

658
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:26,456
Mmm, then, it sounds like it would
be sometime after you turn 30?

659
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:29,220
Like maybe, 35?

660
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:33,353
Well, that's true.

661
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:07,111
A windbreak?

662
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:11,135
We're putting a hanok on the seashore.

663
00:49:11,136 --> 00:49:13,745
Haven't you thought about safety?

664
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:17,332
Do you know what kind of
budget that requires?

665
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,685
It will be impossible to get
the support of the residents.

666
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:24,740
Manager Yun, getting support is your role.

667
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:30,331
The establishment of a windbreak.

668
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,941
the resident's living space

669
00:49:31,942 --> 00:49:33,906
without any modifications to the model.

670
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,254
50 homes, preserved exactly as they are.

671
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,228
Without any modifications?

672
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:42,303
Then you're not planning to
disassemble and assemble?

673
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:44,516
We'll preserve them as is.

674
00:49:44,517 --> 00:49:46,933
What about the small homes
that aren't worth preserving?

675
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:50,240
They are all fully worth preserving.

676
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,860
Fine, preserve it exactly.

677
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:55,326
But, the windbreak is impossible.

678
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:59,568
If that's impossible,
then I'll give up this project.

679
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:04,319
Do you know what Manager Yun
went through to win that deal?

680
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,673
What's important to me is
not how a project is won,

681
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:09,698
but more how it's executed.

682
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:20,010
Aigoo, aigoo... that, that...

683
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:23,254
That guy really only thinks of himself.

684
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:22,340
Are you worried, then?

685
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:25,462
What?

686
00:51:25,463 --> 00:51:29,829
Offended that I dropped in
some informal speech?

687
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:31,855
Are you drunk?

688
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,011
I'm drunk.

689
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:38,689
What is this?

690
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:42,621
I really don't know what I'm doing here.

691
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,762
My lip is busted.

692
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,424
I've fallen, I've stumbled.

693
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:49,859
That means the same thing.

694
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,042
Falling and stumbling.

695
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,276
I'm sorry.

696
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:06,785
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

697
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:10,390
My plans have become a mess.

698
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:16,770
What were the plans for today?

699
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:23,430
Aye, tell me.

700
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,477
So, at least I could feel
like I've done them.

701
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,062
If you take a boat out this way,

702
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,598
there's an uninhabited island.

703
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,725
There's truly no one on
this uninhabited island.

704
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:38,208
Isn't that why it's an uninhabited island?

705
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:45,852
Shh, and what were you planning after
taking me somewhere with no one around?

706
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:51,280
The sunset you can see
from there is astounding.

707
00:52:52,112 --> 00:52:54,942
Sunset.

708
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:04,227
Are you regretting coming?

709
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,688
I could be.

710
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:17,815
Since you were at fault
for some of my misery,

711
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:21,114
do one thing I ask.

712
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:26,817
I don't want to.

713
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:31,028
Then, are you saying you
weren't at fault for anything?

714
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:35,136
That, well, that's not it, but...

715
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:39,210
What is it?

716
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,148
Sing me a song.

717
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:47,001
Eh?

718
00:53:48,115 --> 00:53:50,392
This, look at this guy...

719
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,636
And this one...

720
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:56,690
It really hurts, you know.

721
00:54:04,194 --> 00:54:06,003
All right.

722
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:08,748
I'll just chalk these 2 nights and 3 days

723
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:11,014
as a bad memory.

724
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,412
That's all right.

725
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:23,417
Is that one thing enough?

726
00:54:38,912 --> 00:54:45,006
<i>Sitting in a flower garden,</i>

727
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:51,327
<i>I'm looking at the petals.</i>

728
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:57,223
<i>Where could the pretty light</i>

729
00:54:57,224 --> 00:55:00,544
<i>have come from?</i>

730
00:55:00,545 --> 00:55:06,408
<i>Beautiful flower,</i>

731
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:11,559
<i>flower.</i>

732
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:20,556
<i>On such a lovely day like this,</i>

733
00:55:20,557 --> 00:55:27,238
<i>On such a lovely day like this,</i>

734
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:33,589
<i>If that person were to come,</i>

735
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:40,446
<i>how wonderful it would be.</i>

736
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:48,204
<i>Sitting in a flower garden,</i>

737
00:55:48,205 --> 00:55:53,459
<i>I'm looking at the petals.</i>

738
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,700
<i>Where could the pretty light</i>

739
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:01,946
<i>have come from?</i>

740
00:56:01,947 --> 00:56:07,860
<i>Beautiful blooming flower.</i>

741
00:56:09,169 --> 00:56:12,241
<i>Doo roo roo roo roo roo</i>

742
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:15,173
<i>Doo roo roo</i>

743
00:56:15,393 --> 00:56:20,756
<i>Doo roo roo roo roo rooooo</i>

744
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:26,467
<i>Doo roo roo roo rooo...</i>

745
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:01,417
Let's go.

746
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:15,479
Now, then, I'll do the driving.

747
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,066
Shall we finish our Truth game
from last night on the way?

748
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,485
Here, climb in.

749
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:22,683
Don't worry.

750
00:57:22,684 --> 00:57:24,680
You can feel safe.

751
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:29,114
Have a seat.

752
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:34,619
We'll put your bag in here.

753
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,891
What are you doing? Get in.

754
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:54,619
Go on, go on...

755
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,159
Now then...

756
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:15,979
Let's listen as we drive.

757
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,022
Ahh. That's fine. I like it too, classical.

758
00:58:58,728 --> 00:59:05,368
<i>[Did you get in okay?]</i>

759
00:59:10,132 --> 00:59:12,133
<i>[Jo Jae Hee]</i>

760
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:30,405
It's J-Jo Jae Hee.

761
00:59:30,406 --> 00:59:32,550
Did you get in okay?

762
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:36,197
Yes, ah... well...

763
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,334
Are you at home?

764
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:39,983
Yes, I'm home.

765
00:59:39,984 --> 00:59:41,875
And you?

766
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,027
I'm home.

767
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,241
When did you get in?

768
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:50,841
Right around 6:00, I think?

769
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:55,676
How did you get home?

770
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:59,031
Mun Seok Hwan drove me home.

771
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:02,650
That guy's pastime is proposing to women.

772
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:05,150
You should be careful.

773
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:06,917
Is that so?

774
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:11,713
And to lonely older women like you,
he's even worse.

775
01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:14,429
Can't you keep from saying stuff like that?

776
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:17,594
With the money he's spent on
rings to propose to women,

777
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:21,106
you could have probably bought our business.

778
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:26,148
The vacation... I enjoyed it.

779
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:30,714
Really?

780
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,582
That's a relief.

781
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,399
Goodnight.

782
01:00:44,817 --> 01:00:47,829
You too, Dr. Jang.

783
01:01:27,155 --> 01:01:30,109
She's been in there all
day since this morning.

784
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,762
Why's she doing that?

785
01:01:31,763 --> 01:01:33,863
I don't know.

786
01:01:34,445 --> 01:01:37,563
She hasn't said a single word, has she?

787
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,899
I think it means that she doesn't
want us to talk to her.

788
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:47,860
I'll resolve the windbreak.

789
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:50,233
I'll make it work somehow.

790
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:52,320
That's a given.

791
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:54,424
Oh, Manager, you rock!

792
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:58,387
Don't think it's a given, because
it's going to be a really tough task.

793
01:02:04,814 --> 01:02:07,029
It's hysteria.

794
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,492
You could have at least
given her a "Thank you. "

795
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,525
Why is that necessary.

796
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:14,165
It is necessary.

797
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:17,014
Those are words that motivate people.

798
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:21,630
What are you going to do if she gets
sick and tired of this and leaves us?

799
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:25,001
I don't see the point in answering
such a ridiculous question.

800
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:28,235
I'm nervous about the Manager leaving,

801
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:31,928
so what makes you so confident she'll stay.

802
01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:36,423
Because I have no reason
to betray Manager Yun.

803
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:37,996
Betray?

804
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,565
What Mom?

805
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:00,943
Did you enjoy yourselves?

806
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:04,532
What does that matter?

807
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:08,296
Answer when I ask you a question.

808
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:13,253
Sign the surgery release.

809
01:03:13,254 --> 01:03:14,921
Was Mr. Jo nice to you?

810
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:16,699
Father.

811
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:21,773
Ah, Sir, it sounds like you are talking
to your son-in-law after the honeymoon.

812
01:03:21,774 --> 01:03:24,843
I'd like to at least have the feeling.

813
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,309
I understand.

814
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:31,518
After I find out how your trip went,
I'll think about signing.

815
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,082
You could have just pretended to go.

816
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:41,772
Now, what's that?

817
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:43,375
Truly...

818
01:03:43,376 --> 01:03:45,549
he is quite the busy elder.

819
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:51,691
I will start the questions, so the two
of you answer at the same time.

820
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,301
What was the most memorable place?

821
01:03:57,779 --> 01:03:58,591
That's enough.

822
01:03:58,592 --> 01:03:59,712
I'm not going to answer.

823
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:00,900
Good job.

824
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:04,900
You two work in perfect harmony.

825
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:06,047
You really did go.

826
01:04:06,448 --> 01:04:07,234
They really did go.

827
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,608
Now, why don't the 2 of
you cut your alliance.

828
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:18,153
Our ultimate goal is
to form a family alliance.

829
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:21,365
Aigoo.

830
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,453
Father, stop it now.

831
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:27,861
The Vice President is here,
and this is my place of work.

832
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:31,366
Now, I've used up my
card as much as I could.

833
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,481
<i>I'll have the surgery.</i>

834
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,745
I'm asking because I'm sincerely curious...

835
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:42,861
Do the two of you not have any desire to date?
