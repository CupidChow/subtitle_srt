{\a6}Episode 7

5
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:08,058
What?

6
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:11,962
Where have we seen each other before?

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:24,607
Do you want to come in for a bit?

8
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:26,742
What?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,705
Drink some tea before you leave.

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,588
What tea? Ha, it's okay.

11
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,990
Don't be like this…

12
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,487
Just come in for a bit.

13
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:47,038
Even for a little bit is fine.

14
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:53,049
Wait a second.

15
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:56,159
Why... why are you like this?

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,435
Why am I like this…?

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,456
<i>Tha... that!</i>

18
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:11,320
<i>You really don't know?</i>

19
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,212
Please! Please don't be like this!

20
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>We can't be like this!</i>

21
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:21,114
Don't want it to be like this! No! No!

22
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,911
<i>You, you...</i>

23
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:38,940
They've already started...

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,128
to treat my house as if it's their own.

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,876
What was that?

26
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:55,774
What happened?

27
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:59,632
Ahjussi, stomach…

28
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:05,439
Stomach… hurts?

29
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,835
Can't you see?

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,938
Tomorrow morning will be the surgery.

31
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:28,019
Doctor, I really have to do the surgery?

32
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,649
It seems like I've done a lot though.

33
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:31,976
Of course you do.

34
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:35,083
Hey, you have appendicitis.
How can you not get surgery?

35
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:38,261
I'm kind of worried since
I haven't gone to work for four days.

36
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,050
And also, I can't stop worrying about Sanggu.

37
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,624
Didn't I tell you not to worry about Sanggu?
I will look after him.

38
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:46,530
<i>Don't worry.</i>

39
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:50,386
Patient's room is ready,
I'll help you move her over there.

40
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,900
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

41
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,744
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

42
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,993
Be careful, be careful.

43
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,479
Be careful, be careful.

44
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,631
Doctor! Can you help me look after Sanggu?

45
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:13,415
My sister gave birth, so I can't bring him home.

46
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:19,706
I've also tried giving some friends a call,
but there's really no one suitable.

47
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:41,061
Something urgent came up
for Dr. Jang Mun Jung today, so she already left.

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,872
What?

49
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:47,851
You came for internal treatment, right?
I'll get another doctor for you.

50
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,234
No need.

51
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:10,822
<i>What the...?</i>

52
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:37,360
Seems like I'll have to buy another set.

53
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,043
[Episode 7]
[Responsibility... About that heaviness]

54
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:00,118
Project? What project?

55
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,889
A Song Li Mun Bo Wu project.

56
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:10,467
Hey! You're playing around with those toys again?

57
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:13,768
I really think you did a good job
of not getting married.

58
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:19,212
Being a husband that plays with toys every day,
your wife will probably go crazy.

59
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,336
Why did you call me?

60
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,292
Hey! Come have a drink with me.

61
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:28,317
Yun Hee and Yeh Won went to kindergarten camp.

62
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,580
I'm finally free today!

63
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,221
I've always been really free,
but I'm really busy right now.

64
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,568
Ah, this jerk.

65
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,617
He said that he's not coming out
because he's making a toy.

66
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,929
Who?

67
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,594
Mm, a friend.

68
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,586
He's your friend,
but is making a toy at this hour?

69
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,844
I really admire those maniac kinds of men.

70
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,582
If there's a chance, bring him here together.

71
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,321
What could it be at this hour?

72
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,675
Yu Jin has acute appendicitis
and needs to get surgery.

73
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:56,984
And then?

74
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,630
So she has to stay in the hospital.

75
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:07,489
Originally, I wanted to help take care of Sanggu,
but the place where I live forbids pets.

76
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:11,394
When I sneaked him in, they found out,
so they kicked us out.

77
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,474
So?

78
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,809
Jo Jae Hee, can you help
take care of him for a bit?

79
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:24,605
No.

80
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,872
It's only for four days,
and plus, it's your neighbor's puppy!

81
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,901
You should be able to do this for her.

82
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,609
I can't.

83
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,257
No?

84
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,596
No.

85
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,715
<i>I understand.</i>

86
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:54,129
Then don't ever come
to where I am if you're sick.

87
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:57,000
What? What kind of reason is that?

88
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:00,404
There are lots of others who can look after
Jo Jae Hee's illness instead of me.

89
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,782
<i>This poor kid, he doesn't even have
a place to stay tonight.</i>

90
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,912
You think I can be deceived with those words?

91
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,701
Go on and rest then.

92
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,246
Let's go.

93
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,714
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,379
Sanggu, it seems like you'll have to sleep
at the dog hotel tonight.

95
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,783
You said before that you won't
look after my illness,

96
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,237
can doctors really do those kind of things?

97
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:24,773
I felt bad after I said those things, I apologize.

98
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:30,727
Then, four days.

99
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,936
Thank you!

100
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,390
Please take off his clothes.

101
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:37,192
<i>What?</i>

102
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,304
Ah! You mean you don't like
dogs who wear clothes.

103
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:43,785
Please wait a second.

104
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:53,710
Aigoo, then it's like this, at this big street,
you also have pride, right?

105
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,006
Because of someone else's dog,
what are the both of us doing at this big street?

106
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:02,014
Being apart from her parents,
she's living alone in Seoul.

107
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:05,294
When they're sick, we would help, but so what?

108
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,942
This... what is this?

109
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:09,984
A webcam.

110
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,104
By using the computer, I can see
how Sanggu's doing at someone else's house.

111
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:17,231
If she keeps using money on unnecessary things,
she'll have no money.

112
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,478
This is what I brought for Yu Jin.

113
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,927
And this, is Sanggu's food for four days.

114
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,718
And also, in the morning,
you have to give him at least a 30 minute walk.

115
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:34,588
I won't do anything else
except for feeding and walking.

116
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:36,714
Good.

117
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,006
Goodnight, Sanggu.

118
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,302
There... shouldn't be any problem.

119
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,591
What?

120
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:35,412
What?

121
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,649
Watch carefully.

122
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,512
This is your most favorite cucumber.

123
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:36,464
That boy, he really is a dog.

124
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:41,181
That...

125
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,863
Coming inside with those paws
that have been out on the streets.

126
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,400
No!

127
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,095
<i>Bowl.</i>

128
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,130
Even though you want to come inside,
you must endure.

129
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,675
My time, my life,
I don't want to let you bother it.

130
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,760
It's already good enough that I'm letting
you eat and sleep. Do you understand?

131
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,364
Whether you eat or not is your own decision.

132
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,828
Then, it's only up to that point.

133
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,330
I'm kind of scared.

134
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:29,318
Don't worry, it's a very simple surgery.

135
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,523
Blood cholesterol is 180/50.

136
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:32,300
Prepare.

137
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,620
Your earrings, your necklace,
they are things that need to be taken off.

138
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:36,517
Okay.

139
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,777
Is Sanggu eating well? Playing well?

140
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:47,322
Sanggu is being watched over by Director...

141
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,529
What?!

142
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,036
I promise I'll watch over him very carefully,
don't worry.

143
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,652
Right, don't worry!

144
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,606
When I told Director about Sanggu's situation,
in the end he's very happy.

145
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,372
That man...

146
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,268
said Sanggu barks at night,

147
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,810
so he was going to throw Sanggu from the balcony.

148
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:19,997
Sanggu! Sanggu!
What am I going to do? Sanggu!

149
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,863
How could that be possible?

150
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,059
Yu Jin.

151
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,631
- You really don't have to worry!
- Honestly!

152
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,734
We've already set up a meet-up day.

153
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,134
<i>Isn't it nice?</i>

154
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:37,418
Yah, this is really weird.

155
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,004
What are you guys doing here?

156
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,727
Distance check.

157
00:17:57,129 --> 00:18:00,156
Boy, it doesn't matter if you wriggle around.

158
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,701
Let's start the meeting,
I still have to go somewhere.

159
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,961
What's wrong?

160
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,841
How could that happen?
How could he easily break free from the leash?

161
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,417
How-how-how could that be? W-where's he going?!

162
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:18,848
S-sanggu! Sanggu! Come out!

163
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,509
<i>Where's he going? Come out! Come out!</i>

164
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,322
Where? Where is he?!

165
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,812
Come out, come out! Sanggu come out!

166
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,636
Where is he?

167
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,369
So we're not going to start the meeting?!

168
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:35,116
Come out! Sanggu! Wait. Sanggu, wait.

169
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,152
Wait... Sanggu! No!

170
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,728
You can't go there! Don't lick, don't lick!

171
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,880
Boy, you filthy little boy.

172
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,618
<i>Sanggu, I'm begging you! Sanggu!</i>

173
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:49,909
Let's work.

174
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:03,232
The surgery was very successful.
You should be able to leave the hospital on time.

175
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,987
Thank you.

176
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:12,190
You're still worrying about Sanggu?
I already said there's nothing to worry about.

177
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,489
I should have just sent him to the dog hotel.

178
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:19,224
That man! His phone can't be reached,
so it makes people really worried.

179
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,293
Jo Jae Hee won't pick his phone up?

180
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,210
Yeah...

181
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:29,215
I normally don't pick up calls from strangers.

182
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,073
How can there be a phone number
you know from the beginning?

183
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,822
Save my phone number
and remember it from now on.

184
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,566
This is your reason for calling?

185
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,463
Ah, how is Sanggu doing?

186
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:43,782
He's not dead yet. Living very well.

187
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:46,345
Why are you responding with that tone?

188
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,057
I have just found a solution.

189
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,154
A solution? What have you done to Sanggu?!

190
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,481
I am Yun Ki Ran.

191
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,629
Ah, hi.

192
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,821
Yes, hi. The dog will be taken care of by me.

193
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,286
Because he can't concentrate
on his work anymore.

194
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:11,774
What?

195
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:15,087
I will take very good care of him, don't worry.

196
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:17,637
I'm very sorry.

197
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,876
What is there to feel sorry about?

198
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:23,313
If I can just have him be immersed in his work,

199
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,397
even if it is doing laundry or cooking,
I will still help him do it.

200
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,360
Right now, I'm going to pick the dog up.

201
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:36,527
Alright... Yeah.

202
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,545
Cleaning and laundry,
does she really love doing those things?

203
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,263
Why did she have to tell me those things?

204
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,872
Such a weird person.

205
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,335
Cleaning, and laundry...?

206
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,578
Instead of those things,
what else is there I haven't helped you with?

207
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,654
Have I said anything wrong?

208
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:11,551
Because it doesn't feel right.

209
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:13,892
What?

210
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:18,767
I'm showing you how important
you are to me, what.

211
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:26,201
But why do I have to help you take care of a dog?

212
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,751
And you for agreeing to take care of the dog,

213
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,120
when did you start
taking care of other people's dogs?

214
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,926
I really don't like this.

215
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:35,572
What?

216
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:38,433
You've changed,
you've changed into something weird.

217
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:41,609
Recently, the things going on around you...

218
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:48,691
Don't change.

219
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:52,481
I still want to be your partner for a bit longer.

220
00:21:57,255 --> 00:22:00,512
What's wrong?
Hurry up and bring the dog down.

221
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:17,782
What am I supposed to do?

222
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,175
Dog?

223
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,470
The dog?

224
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,644
No... Yes. I can do it.

225
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:28,324
Try!

226
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:46,198
He's much smaller than how I imagined him to be.

227
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:47,161
Here.

228
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,614
What? What happened?

229
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,318
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute!

230
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:03,849
Put him inside the car first.

231
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,039
What?

232
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:07,845
Not right, not right!

233
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:10,876
I can't be sure if he won't jump out
when I'm driving the car.

234
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:12,712
What are you doing right now?

235
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:16,783
What a minute! Can't you see I'm trying
to come up with a solution right now?

236
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:18,448
You're joking.

237
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,792
The truth is, I was bitten by a dog once
when I was young.

238
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,879
<i>I'm really scared of dogs.</i>

239
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,296
Then why did you agree
to help take care of the dog?

240
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:30,059
Who told you not to concentrate on your work?!

241
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,896
I understand! I'll try!

242
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,142
I'll try to see.

243
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,196
Ya,

244
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,837
give it to me slowly.

245
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,179
Really.

246
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:27,913
Sanggu, if you're like this again,

247
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:31,515
I'm going to send you to the veterinary hospital.
Understand!?

248
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:47,901
Sit.

249
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:56,960
Clean it up.

250
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,307
<i>Clean it up.</i>

251
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,967
He only knows how to sit.

252
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,387
You don't know how delicious this tastes!
Taste and see!

253
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:14,502
President, you've arrived.
Hello, please have a taste.

254
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:17,794
Why aren't you coming yet?

255
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:29,329
What happened this time?

256
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:32,527
I've come to learn how to send money
through the phone.

257
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:37,991
Back then, it's being done
at Jo's house, but I still won't.

258
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,985
It's quite uncomfortable
not having a maid, right?

259
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,415
Aren't I a bit old? Aren't I a bit old?

260
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:53,360
What is there I can't do?
I've already done cleaning, laundry and cooking.

261
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,831
Time sure passes by fast.

262
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:58,316
Done it, too right. Don't let all your time be wasted
on Mun Jung's marriage problem.

263
00:25:58,436 --> 00:26:00,813
Learn many things and invest in yourself.

264
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:04,866
And stop chasing Jo Jae Hee around.
You think that's good for Mun Jung?

265
00:26:05,935 --> 00:26:09,413
Why would I chase around a man who is stubborn
and only cares about himself?

266
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,221
I just wanted to check.

267
00:26:12,714 --> 00:26:15,847
But, it seems like there won't be
any women problems.

268
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:18,647
<i>He doesn't let anyone come into his house.</i>

269
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,803
He doesn't let any girls in his house.

270
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,458
He's also a very clean person,
doesn't seem like the type who'll cheat.

271
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:29,451
He seems like a good person, seeing how he brought
Mun Jung on the day you took down the signboard.

272
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,877
<i>Forget it.</i>

273
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,550
Just do this first.

274
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:22,314
Green chilies.

275
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,741
I told the President already.
Thank you, please come again soon.

276
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,656
<i>Woof!</i>

277
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:35,568
You were scared, weren't you?

278
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:39,138
How old are you?
Do you think it's cute to play jokes like that?!

279
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:42,701
It's just a joke, why are you acting like that?

280
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,079
A joke has to depend on the other person's
feelings, timing and location!

281
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:49,834
I know, I know, stop it, stop it.

282
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,923
Do you want to go for a walk?

283
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,203
Yes.

284
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:15,108
Just take the dog,
why are you taking photos of me as well?

285
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,113
This is photographic evidence for Yu Jin.

286
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:20,999
This is proof that, Jo Jae Hee,
you are taking very good care of Sanggu.

287
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:26,517
So, if you don't want to see that child
run out of her ward, smile happily.

288
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,366
<i>Cheese!</i>

289
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:36,795
Good, good, cheese!

290
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:38,481
Cheese...

291
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:41,965
That's great.

292
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,588
How many times have you watched it?

293
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:25,253
I thought it would be really dirty,
but it's actually very clean.

294
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:30,576
Doctor Jang said she seems to be interfering
with Ahjussi and Sanggu, so she left first.

295
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,838
Isn't it funny?

296
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:33,616
Ya,

297
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:38,352
if you didn't see me for a few days,
would you miss me that much?

298
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,418
Sanggu!

299
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:47,694
Even though I don't hate dogs,
why do you like them so much?

300
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:49,005
What?

301
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:50,562
Look.

302
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:54,568
I come every day to see you,
warded in the hospital, yet you ignore me.

303
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:58,625
You just keep watching that video
again and again, it really annoys me.

304
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,529
You're angry?

305
00:31:01,513 --> 00:31:03,020
Of course I'm hurt.

306
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:06,383
I really like when you talk about architecture.

307
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:13,408
I just said I'm a little annoyed.
Once in a while, it's interesting to me.

308
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,249
I'll just watch it once. Understand? Hold on.

309
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:33,258
Jump.

310
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:34,426
Jump!

311
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,919
Watch, watch well.

312
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,505
One, two!

313
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,321
Jump!

314
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:47,628
Sanggu.

315
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,914
Are you afraid of this?

316
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,629
This is nothing.

317
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,399
In the future, there will be too many mountains
you'll have to cross.

318
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,365
Sanggu, you can do it.

319
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:03,964
Jump!

320
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:06,428
<i>Jump!</i>

321
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:22,671
Sanggu.

322
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:26,537
This is not true courage.

323
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,493
Try it!

324
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:34,490
<i>You can do it.</i>

325
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:38,152
Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes!

326
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:44,652
Jump!

327
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:58,965
<i>Good fellow.</i>

328
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:00,731
Sanggu!

329
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:03,368
Look, you can do it, can't you!

330
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,218
<i>Ahjussi!</i>

331
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:29,520
I watched the video.

332
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,728
For taking such good care of our Sanggu,
thank you!

333
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:37,040
Get discharged quickly and take your dog away.
It's annoying me to death!

334
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,170
What is our Sanggu doing now?

335
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,195
He's challenging the grilles of the sewage system
right now, trying to jump over them.

336
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:44,965
Eh?

337
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:49,159
What? Our Sanggu will get scared! Don't do that.

338
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:51,029
I'm busy, I'm hanging up.

339
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,468
Ahjussi, Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

340
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:03,566
But... he picks up his phone now.

341
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:01,785
<i>In the stomach, there's something.</i>

342
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,354
Did he swallow anything strange?

343
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:12,357
The tile of the imperial palace.

344
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,407
Eh? What's that?

345
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:20,775
Is it something sharp?

346
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,522
It's plastic, it's not something sharp.

347
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:36,204
The back, the top, the front. It's like that.

348
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:38,512
You don't have to tell me in such detail.

349
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:42,396
If it's something of that size,
he can just discharge it through his poop.

350
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,360
It seems he'll be fine.

351
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:49,354
After his drip is finished, you can collect him,
take him home and feed him his medicine.

352
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,505
Yes. Can we take a look at Sanggu?

353
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:52,468
Yes.

354
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,553
It's fine, let's go.

355
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:13,194
It seems you've developed feelings
in this period of time.

356
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:17,650
It's not feelings, but a sense of responsibility.

357
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:24,053
Because I'm afraid of this situation,
I don't dare to keep pets.

358
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:29,354
If they were to get sick or die,
that situation would be so hard to deal with.

359
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:36,879
I used to have a fish that I liked.
When I was raising it, it died.

360
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,720
The same with plants.

361
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:45,599
Plastic trees that were said never to die,
would die, too.

362
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,480
I really tried all I could.

363
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:50,955
For a doctor to say that...

364
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:58,845
I'm not talking about patients! I'm just afraid
the things I personally raise would be like that.

365
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,089
If you had a child, what would you do?

366
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,695
I shouldn't talk to you.

367
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:08,253
Why do you say things like that, to scare people?

368
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:12,760
Fish too, plastic trees too,
they lived to their fullest before they died.

369
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:15,507
Why would it be Doctor Jang's fault?

370
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:21,667
Self-blame. Why do you think everything's
your fault? That's a psychological illness.

371
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:27,419
I never expected to get a psychological diagnosis
from you, Jo Jae Hee.

372
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,564
Because you said your mother's death,

373
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:35,068
which was actually due to a heart illness,
was your fault, that's why I said that.

374
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:43,214
My father really... told Jo Jae Hee everything.

375
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:47,648
It was because I was young,

376
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,212
so I thought she passed away
because I was disobedient.

377
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,071
Does that make sense?

378
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,550
I said I was young.

379
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:58,660
He woke up!

380
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,913
The drip is done, too.

381
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:10,327
As long as we bring him home and give him
his medicine, he'll pass it out immediately.

382
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,484
Today, I'll bring him back.

383
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:15,254
What?

384
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:20,012
Didn't you say your apartment
didn't allow pet dogs?

385
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:26,210
Of course I'll sneak him in. Who knows
if he'll feel ill again? It's really worrying.

386
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:28,786
Sanggu.

387
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,867
Can I give you a few pointers?

388
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:45,837
Yes?

389
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:50,148
First, you have to tie your garbage up,
so that it won't spill over.

390
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:51,655
I will.

391
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:55,855
Also, he likes to listen
to Beethoven and Mozart's music.

392
00:39:58,486 --> 00:39:59,322
Yes.

393
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,831
When you're walking him, he gets really scared
when children touch him, so you must never let them.

394
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,998
Children will torture him cruelly.

395
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:10,588
Then... Jo Jae Hee, you should bring him back.

396
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,343
It's fine.

397
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,812
Oh my, what are you doing here?

398
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,308
You said you had something on.

399
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:56,651
Ah, after I finished what I had to do,
I came to have a drink with Director Mun.

400
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,524
Director Mun?

401
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:01,356
You're here again?

402
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:08,829
It's a secret! Don't let him find out.

403
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:17,178
- What would you like to drink?
- Manager Yun, what did he say?

404
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,047
Ah, it's nothing.

405
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:23,054
Do you know each other?

406
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,416
No.

407
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:30,188
It's just... every time I come, he's the fellow
who's here alone and tries to play it cool.

408
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:33,422
Ah, is that so?

409
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:47,621
Director Mun, have you never once met our Director Jo?
Do you not know what he looks like?

410
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,782
I don't know. He doesn't participate
in the architects' gatherings either.

411
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,827
He doesn't appear anywhere.

412
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:58,484
He doesn't like to meet people very much.

413
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,001
Could it be that he has a complex
about his looks?

414
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:07,534
Are his looks that horrifying?
Why does he avoid people like that?

415
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:12,059
Sooner or later I'll let you guys meet,
and you can see for yourself.

416
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:21,495
But, you haven't told Director Jo
that you're cooperating with me right?

417
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:27,457
Oh, I should tell him soon.

418
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,966
Manager Yun, your presentation today was great.

419
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:34,301
You really are Yun Ki Ran.

420
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,861
Why are you looking at us like that?

421
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,208
Ah, I'm not looking.

422
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,539
You weren't looking at me?

423
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:54,009
What is there to look at?

424
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,326
Have we met somewhere before,
do you not recognize me?

425
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:04,473
Who knows.

426
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:16,230
Oh, is that your dream type, Manager?

427
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:19,233
He's a strange guy.

428
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:23,736
Not just Manager Yun,
but all the girls that I bring, he'll peep at.

429
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,469
Now, he's just directly flirting with them.

430
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:33,298
Manager Yun, be careful. People who look normal
can have many perverted habits.

431
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:38,335
Why are you speaking evil
of someone you don't know?

432
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:19,011
<i>I'm here!</i>

433
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:23,818
Director Jo. Jung Jae Dong's client
is leaving the country tomorrow.

434
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:27,687
He seems to hope that he could
get the blueprint before that, is that okay?

435
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,626
Why did he make that request
without prior notice? I can't do it.

436
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:35,329
Please finish it before 9 tomorrow morning.
You must.

437
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:40,159
Manager Yun,
what in the world is going on?

438
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:41,663
What?

439
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:45,036
I heard you met Mun Seok Hwan yesterday,

440
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:48,887
and Director even saw the two of you
in a partnership.

441
00:44:49,472 --> 00:44:53,758
Manager Yun, you can't betray us like that.

442
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:59,451
Jo Jae Hee.
Was it you who asked Hyun Kyu to do this?

443
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:00,881
What did I ask him to do?

444
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:05,454
You told him to ask what I was cooperating
with Mun Seok Hwan on when I met with him?

445
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:08,366
No, why would I do something like that?

446
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:13,510
I said I saw Manager Yun together with
the fraudulent architect. He did that himself.

447
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,550
Would you...

448
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:18,880
be thinking of jumping ship
to Mun Seok Hwan's company?

449
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:20,978
Are you curious?

450
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:22,408
No, I'm not.

451
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,173
Okay, then I don't have to make
any special explanations.

452
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,441
What is going on, Manager?

453
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:35,555
Hyun Kyu, print me a copy of the construction budget.
Till tomorrow morning, we'll be quite busy.

454
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,115
If you tell me, I'll do it for you.

455
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,878
What? This fellow.

456
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:42,797
Your pay is gone.

457
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:48,784
Hello.

458
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,441
You know Yu Jin is getting discharged today?
I just sent her home.

459
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:56,795
Is Sanggu fine now?

460
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:03,115
Yes. He's eating well, and running well.

461
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,929
Yu Jin seems to be really touched by you, Jo Jae Hee.
Do you want to hand over Sanggu to her yourself?

462
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:17,231
Why would I do something that useless? Forget it.

463
00:46:17,552 --> 00:46:19,010
What about it?

464
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:23,296
<i>Sanggu seems to be really upset
because he didn't say goodbye to you.</i>

465
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:27,948
I'm really busy right now.

466
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:31,161
Yes, of course.

467
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:37,455
What?

468
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,241
Sanggu is missing!

469
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:42,531
Missing, what does that mean?

470
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:46,152
I don't know, he suddenly disappeared,
I'll call you again!

471
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:47,651
Sanggu!

472
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,682
<i>Sanggu!</i>

473
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,992
<i>Hyun Kyu, there's an item missing in the budget,
can you check it again?</i>

474
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,273
<i>What? How can it be?</i>

475
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:02,150
<i>I've looked through it.</i>

476
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:04,801
<i>I'll check it.</i>

477
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:11,727
<i>Sanggu!</i>

478
00:47:12,377 --> 00:47:13,404
Sanggu!

479
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,139
Sanggu!

480
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:20,471
Sanggu!

481
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:24,797
Excuse me... It's a very, very small dog,
did you see it running by itself?

482
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,138
We didn't see it.

483
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:27,542
<i>Sanggu!</i>

484
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,265
Sanggu!

485
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:31,895
<i>Sanggu!</i>

486
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,821
Sanggu!

487
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,378
Sanggu!

488
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:41,182
Sanggu!

489
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:43,845
Sanggu!

490
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,771
Sanggu!

491
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:48,351
Sanggu!

492
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:50,448
Sanggu!

493
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,594
- Sanggu!
- Sanggu! Sanggu!

494
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:56,875
<i>Sanggu!</i>

495
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,861
Sanggu!

496
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:10,001
<i>Sanggu, Sanggu, Sanggu!</i>

497
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,167
Have you not found him?

498
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:36,523
We should tell Yu Jin.

499
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:38,910
Let's try looking again.

500
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:42,855
I'll look for him on the route back to the house,
Doctor Jang, you try looking this way.

501
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:43,676
Yes.

502
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:47,888
Sanggu!

503
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:05,195
His name is Sanggu.
He's yellow, a Chihuahua about 60 cm long.

504
00:49:05,357 --> 00:49:09,138
His eyes are round and protruding,
usually his ears are like that,

505
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:10,639
if he's scared,
they'll stand up like this. Like this!

506
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:13,591
His eyes... Oh that's right,
he loves cucumbers very, very much.

507
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:15,002
His name is San Gu.

508
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:18,840
Not San Gu, it's Sanggu, Sanggu, Sanggu!

509
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,243
The department that's in charge of kidnapping,
please let me know their phone number.

510
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:27,665
Quickly, quickly tell me the phone number
for the department in charge of kidnapping!

511
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:23,573
Ahjussi, what is going on?

512
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:27,981
I'm sorry.

513
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:32,156
Sanggu...

514
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,829
<i>Sang... How?</i>

515
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:42,204
Of course you'd feel sorry.

516
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:43,940
Once I got discharged and came home,

517
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:46,416
<i>I saw him all wet like this,
waiting in front of the apartment.</i>

518
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:50,234
Is that so? So it was like that, what a relief.

519
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:52,943
What's so good about that?

520
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,314
If you want to take responsibility,
you have to be responsible till the end.

521
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:58,576
<i>If not, you might as well not take responsibility.
What is this?</i>

522
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,396
I'm sorry.

523
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:03,059
I'm sorry?

524
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,039
Ahjussi, if I hadn't come home,
do you know what would've happened?

525
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,589
<i>I don't even dare think about it.</i>

526
00:52:15,472 --> 00:52:18,455
We found him, isn't that enough?

527
00:52:23,402 --> 00:52:26,794
<i>He actually said that was enough.
How could someone be like that?</i>

528
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,799
Let's go, Sanggu.

529
00:52:33,406 --> 00:52:35,100
<i>Let's go, Sanggu.</i>

530
00:53:01,522 --> 00:53:03,455
Sanggu, we found him.

531
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:08,408
He met up with Yu Jin in front of the apartment.

532
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:10,620
What a relief.

533
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,655
That's really a relief.

534
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:17,523
Doctor Jang, are you alright?

535
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:23,204
I really thought...
I really thought I lost Sanggu.

536
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,424
Everything's fine already, don't worry about it.

537
00:53:31,915 --> 00:53:33,013
Let's go.

538
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,737
Are you satisfied?

539
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,830
What?

540
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:03,986
You helped the child that left her parents
and is alone in Seoul. Isn't that what you said?

541
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,435
Thank you.

542
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:16,174
If I were by myself, I would be really afraid.

543
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,430
Oh, Sanggu.

544
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:36,569
- Oh, Sanggu, I'm sorry!
- Doctor, why are you like that?

545
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:41,112
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

546
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:43,205
What's there to be sorry about, Doctor?

547
00:54:43,606 --> 00:54:48,388
It's all because of that ahjussi.
I shouldn't have given him to that ahjussi.

548
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:54,308
Sanggu wasn't lost by Jo Jae Hee.
It was because of me. It's my fault, I'm sorry.

549
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:55,941
What... lost?

550
00:54:56,883 --> 00:54:59,444
Jo Jae Hee didn't tell you?

551
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:07,733
I'm really sorry, Yu Jin.

552
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:14,209
Let me see, are you injured anywhere?
Look at this leg, you poor thing.

553
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:56,932
What?

554
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,087
About yesterday... I'm sorry.

555
00:56:00,497 --> 00:56:02,752
The other time, when I threw the money, too.

556
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:06,603
Ah, I don't know why,
I get angry when I see Ahjussi.

557
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:10,976
Can you forgive me once?

558
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:16,835
Forget it, go.

559
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:18,947
Did you forgive me?

560
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:26,066
Next time, I'll treat you to something delicious.

561
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,469
Wait, hold on.

562
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:47,953
Wait, wait.

563
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:04,318
This...

564
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:08,236
This is Sanggu's favorite music.

565
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,934
Ahjussi!

566
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,639
Even till this point...

567
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,650
You don't know Beethoven, do you?

568
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,231
I've listened to him before.

569
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:23,403
Living with a master like you,
I'm afraid he'll never hear it again.

570
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:25,642
That's why I'm giving it to you.

571
00:57:27,755 --> 00:57:29,476
Which ones should he listen to?

572
00:57:29,772 --> 00:57:31,296
La Donna È Mobile.

573
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:37,132
Just listen to Track 3.

574
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,312
I know.

575
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:41,262
Thank you.

576
00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:43,669
Sanggu, let's go!

577
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,868
Hey, 703!

578
00:57:57,428 --> 00:57:59,395
What clothes are those?

579
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:03,220
I have a name, 702 Ahjussi!

580
00:58:41,038 --> 00:58:42,639
<i>Welcome!</i>

581
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,190
Isn't this music I know?

582
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,316
He really looks down on me.

583
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:43,189
Oh, hello!

584
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:47,811
What are you doing here?

585
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,478
No... just... that...

586
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:58,863
I'll help you carry it.

587
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:01,738
How rare, you even bought fish.

588
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:06,020
Have you reared fish before?
Do you have confidence?

589
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:12,357
I've reared seaweed.
Just like designing a forest in the water.

590
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:16,401
Seaweed... Is that a little easier?

591
01:00:18,676 --> 01:00:22,642
If you've caught it, you have to raise it.
It's that easy.

592
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:23,875
Is that so?

593
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:37,490
You catch the roots on this side, then you
bury it deeply. Then spread it carefully.

594
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:41,178
If you just watch, it won't do.
Follow me and try it.

595
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,564
Hand, hand!

596
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,207
How could you touch it with your hand?

597
01:00:57,499 --> 01:00:59,412
Isn't it a little too crowded?

598
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:05,253
Seaweed needs to keep a distance of about 1 to 2 cm,
and be neatly planted in.

599
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:09,279
This standard is quite good,
you don't even have a ruler, how could you know?

600
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:14,372
If you put them in neatly like this,
then they'll look good when they grow.

601
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,465
Watch.

602
01:01:17,698 --> 01:01:18,642
<i>Like this.</i>

603
01:01:21,736 --> 01:01:22,828
Like this.

604
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:30,155
If you use your eyes and just look at it,
the distance looks about right.

605
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:32,930
If it's hard using your eyes...
give me your hand.

606
01:01:34,683 --> 01:01:41,926
This is 1.5 cm, this is 5 cm,
this is 10 cm. Like that.

607
01:01:44,937 --> 01:01:47,182
Oh, I use my hands as a ruler.

608
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:49,716
Here, your entire body is a ruler.

609
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:55,312
178 cm.

610
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,961
The same as my height, 178 cm.

611
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:01,349
1 m.

612
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:03,090
30 cm.

613
01:02:06,675 --> 01:02:10,507
30, 30, 30, total is 90 cm.

614
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:12,496
1 m.

615
01:02:15,947 --> 01:02:17,730
Are architects all like that?

616
01:02:20,378 --> 01:02:21,444
Your palm,

617
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,381
the size of your foot,

618
01:02:23,501 --> 01:02:25,800
can all be used as a ruler.

619
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:35,583
30 cm, 60 cm.

620
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:39,551
I'm going to go home and measure it with a ruler.

621
01:02:40,354 --> 01:02:44,549
Now, you only need to pour the water in,
and then put the fish in.

622
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:49,437
So it's done like that. Then the little fish
will swim around leisurely in here.

623
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,408
Yes.

624
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:00,388
What?

625
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:07,814
The tropical fish, the sterilizing tablets and the
purifying liquid, you put it all in together, too.

626
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:12,443
Tropical fish are very sensitive to hands,
so you have to keep the lights on at all times.

627
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:18,329
And, follow what I say, and in future,
they'll definitely not die.

628
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,552
Are you giving them to me?

629
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:30,413
Anyway, just rear one first.
After you've gained confidence,

630
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:35,425
then Doctor Jang can rear a pair that she likes,
or a bunch, this is up to you.

631
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:40,559
Anyway, they're in the tank, you can't lose them.

632
01:03:43,873 --> 01:03:46,745
Jo Jae Hee... what about you...

633
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:52,597
Because I needed to teach Doctor Jang,
that's why I spent so much time.

634
01:03:52,717 --> 01:03:56,475
If it were someone less clumsy,
I would only need ten minutes!

635
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:01,870
Thank you.

636
01:04:09,566 --> 01:04:12,822
Jo Jae Hee, there doesn't seem
to be anything you don't know.

637
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:15,139
Is it because you gave all the energy
that you were supposed to focus on women,

638
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,999
to the rest of the living things on earth?

639
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:21,393
What does that mean?

640
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,587
Didn't you say you weren't interested
in a relationship?

641
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,925
I never said anything like that.

642
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:31,195
What?

643
01:04:33,066 --> 01:04:35,957
I said I would not get married.

644
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:38,798
What?

645
01:04:45,226 --> 01:04:51,774
Then... do you have thoughts about dating?

for consultations with you?</i>

<i>You have to maintain your youth,
I'll send it over every morning.</i>

You look very compatible from the back!

Jo Jae Hee has a girlfriend.

657
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,458
<i>I saw.</i>

658
01:05:29,465 --> 01:05:30,277
<i>What?</i>

659
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,889
<i>You were with a woman.</i>

660
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,308
Did you see that woman? How did you see?

<i>Is Manager really dating Mun Seok Hwan?</i>

662
01:05:36,629 --> 01:05:38,608
Dad, I'll go for a matchmaking session.

663
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,423
<i>So there really is a chance
that you could matchmake a person twice.</i>
