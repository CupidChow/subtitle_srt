Episode 5

4
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,657
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:22,827
What?

6
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:26,453
We should be watching it together, but I...

7
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,167
It's fine.

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,609
Then... could I watch it with you by your side?

9
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:41,590
Yes.

10
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:46,112
If you wish to, of course I welcome it.

11
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,332
Thank you.

12
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,659
This...

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,300
All of you come up, quickly!

14
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,999
Hurry, hurry!

15
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:02,752
Hello, Ahjussi.

16
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:04,213
Hello!

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,298
Wow, it's really pretty.

18
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,370
That...isn't it merrier with
everyone together?

19
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,187
Wow! Wow!

20
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:36,894
Look at that.

21
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:40,734
Wow, that's really cool.

22
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:45,968
Do you have a pamphlet?
I heard the fireworks have names too.

23
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,520
If we go according to the sequence,
it would be quite interesting.

24
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,317
Golden Inure.

25
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,897
In order to present the effect of the
fire shooting in all directions,

26
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:04,462
The gunpowder pellets have to spread slowly.
This is quite a difficult technique.

27
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:09,463
Wow, you really know everything.

28
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,838
That...that is Red Greace!

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,775
It's really pretty.

30
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,230
It's really cool.

31
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,916
Ahjussi, come watch it together with us,
we could drink beer together too.

32
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,524
Yes, come over!

33
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:29,884
Come over, come over!

34
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,526
Come over, quickly!

35
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,592
How pretty!

36
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,406
It's really pretty!

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,054
It's really pretty.

38
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:00,799
Wow, Ahjussi, what's that one called?

39
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,449
Oh my.

40
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:12,023
Doctor, Doctor, look there.

41
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:22,892
Wow. How did he move the
chair up there as well?

42
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:28,857
Watching that Ahjussi is more interesting
than watching the fireworks.

43
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:32,605
He wants to be alone that much.

44
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:36,574
Does anyone want any more beer?

45
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:37,560
I'll go get some.

46
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:38,861
I'll go get it.

47
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:54,877
<i>Do you think that that Ahjussi doesn't
want to get married, or can't get married?</i>

48
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,175
<i>Of course he can't get married.</i>

49
00:03:56,176 --> 00:04:00,390
<i>Ya, take one look and you'll know.
Of course it's because he can't.</i>

50
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:05,595
<i>- Exactly, it's because he can't.
- Wow.</i>

51
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,859
<i>Wow, it's really pretty!
It's really pretty!</i>

52
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:24,033
That's Coconut Tree.

53
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,011
He Who Can't Marry.

54
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:43,806
Not Inviting Anyone Into Your House =
Not Letting Anyone Into Your Life?
Doesn't Matter If Its Friends Or Lovers...

55
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,406
Are you going to begin
your afternoon consultations?

56
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,548
Sure, let's do that.

57
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:06,011
Yes, I can be organized in the hospital.
Why can't I do it at home?

58
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:09,830
But I feel that your house should
be cleaned up really neatly.

59
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:15,438
After I get home from work, I'm tired.
The clothes pile up, I pretend I don't see them.

60
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,616
Dust is under my feet everywhere,
but I pretend I don't see it either.

61
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:22,803
Although I occasionally find
some time to clean.

62
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:26,914
But I don't have the desire to do chores, with
such a small house...oh you scared me!!!

63
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:33,258
You're here? All thanks to you, we had a great
time watching fireworks the other day.

64
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:38,883
Please take a seat.

65
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:46,443
Your laundry is piled up,
dust is everywhere?

66
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:51,261
Where are you feeling
unwell again today?

67
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:53,352
I feel like my head hurts.

68
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,612
Have you taken any medicine?

69
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:55,435
No.

70
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,627
I'll take a look.

71
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,845
The medicine I gave you for your headaches
last time, there should be some left over.

72
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:07,956
This is something we say often: If you have a
slight headache, please rest for a while.

73
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:13,001
If you don't feel better, then you should
come to the hospital. What do you think?

74
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:17,347
Because of patients like Mr. Jo Jae Hee,
we're made a lot busier.

75
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,829
That's why...

76
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:24,143
Your laundry is piled up,
and dust is everywhere?

77
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,540
That's not it.

78
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:32,443
Blaming patients for your inability to do
household chores is a little ridiculous.

79
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:39,082
I see you won't let it go, so let me
change what I said a little.

80
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:45,918
It's not that I can't do household chores,
but because I'm busy, so I've let go a little.

81
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:47,892
My character is...

82
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:53,075
No matter how busy I am at work,
I will never tolerate my house being messy.

83
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,318
Everything has to be in its place.

84
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,219
In order to have an orderly environment,
you must consistently maintain a clean state.

85
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,598
How clean your house must be...
I can imagine.

86
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,878
Yes.

87
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:21,057
It's regretful that I can't show it to you.
I never invite outsiders into my house.

88
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,910
I never asked you to show me.

89
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:25,362
No matter what.

90
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,893
You said you don't have the ability
to do your household chores.

91
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:34,892
In the end, it's because you
don't want to do them, right?

92
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:42,779
Yes, I hate doing household chores. So what?
Do I inconvenience you in any way?

93
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:54,531
If you hate household chores that much,
even if you eventually get married...

94
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:58,603
Why do you care if I get married or not?

95
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:04,799
My head is starting to hurt.
Oh, my head.

96
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,834
Are you alright?

97
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,584
Looking at you, I feel like being a
doctor is quite a difficult profession.

98
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:27,537
I have to treat patients,
read medical journals, and study.

99
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,967
Jo Jae Hee still comes often.

100
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,876
He comes that often?

101
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,377
He doesn't want to listen to any medical
advice at all. Yet he comes all the time.

102
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:39,257
He just wants to say what he has to say,
till his heart is content, before leaving.

103
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:48,754
Saying things like no one can enter his house and
how stringently he cleans. No one asked him!

104
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:53,881
Doctor's character seems
to be changing a little.

105
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,865
I yelled in the hospital today.

106
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,382
Really?

107
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,131
Pushing people this far!

108
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,647
I'm such an amiable and good doctor.

109
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:12,324
You're not someone who
can say these kinds of things.

110
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:16,738
Arrogance could be infectious.

111
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:26,525
What a luxury. Meeting you makes me happy.
To be able to get massages in places like these,

112
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:30,627
In times of trouble, coolly lending me money.

113
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,558
Please sit up.

114
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,027
I'm sorry, are we too noisy?

115
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,000
No, it's fine.

116
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,152
What's there that I can't do?

117
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:46,553
What's the use in saving up money
I've spent so much effort earning?

118
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,746
But...

119
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:54,856
What's in that Ahjussi's house that he doesn't
let anyone in? Aren't you curious at all?

120
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,222
Absolutely not.

121
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:05,215
Hello, special delivery!

122
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:17,829
I took it for convenience's sake.

123
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,372
I lied that I was your wife.

124
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:23,937
I'll carry it in.

125
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,087
Where?

126
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,662
Is there something you're
keeping secret in there?

127
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:39,929
If I close the door, you'll be hurt. I won't
be merciful just because you're a woman.

128
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:46,404
That box has fish written on it. Let's eat it
together! I even brought it up for you!

129
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,200
One.

130
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,605
Two.

131
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,362
Three!

132
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,607
Ah, what a petty fellow!

133
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,756
After I take off the flesh, shall I leave
you the bones? I don't drink soup.

134
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,490
Then...

135
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,941
I'll help you slice the sashimi!

136
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,411
If you behave like that,
you won't even get the bones!

137
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,268
I get it.

138
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,742
Then after you finish slicing the fish,
call me on the intercom, and I'll come get it.

139
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,886
Wow, how could he not leave a piece
of flesh at all?! What an evil fellow.

140
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,684
Can this still make soup?

141
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:16,733
He should have just thrown away the skin!

142
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,042
Ah, really. It can't be that he was so lazy to
take out the trash he left it to me, right?!

143
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,375
Director Park Chung Sun meant to do it at first.
Could you replace him and finish it?

144
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,735
He can't return to Korea temporarily because
his project overseas was extended.

145
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:40,861
The project overseas can be sold for money.
This can't be sold, right?

146
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,971
Yes, there's no money involved.

147
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:47,536
Including the market price for repairs on
traditional Korean houses, its only 10,000 dollars.

148
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,364
I'll do it.

149
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:50,552
Can you do it?

150
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:54,228
If the work starts in September, it means
that the draft has to be out within this week.

151
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:58,196
He clearly knows that his schedule is
very full, why is he still accepting jobs?

152
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:02,926
It's the remodeling of a traditional
Korean house, his favorite type of job.

153
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,366
It's estimated to have been built
for more than 70 years.

154
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,741
Oh, you're right.

155
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:10,491
It was built in 1937.

156
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,483
Just looking at the photographs,
how could you tell?

157
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,468
The original shape of the
windows on the firehouse.

158
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:20,304
The look of the window frame, the roof,
were all structures built before 1940.

159
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:21,311
Where are you going?

160
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:22,756
To look at that house.

161
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:27,756
Ya, before you go, you have to
get the agreement from the client!

162
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,666
The windows and door on this side,
still have quite a good shape.

163
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,168
Won't it be too low,
if we follow the original?

164
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:55,778
Ya, just to cut the story short,
this is made to last, take a look.

165
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,160
Ah, my pants!

166
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:02,594
Confirm that the dimensions
of the rooms are right.

167
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:11,143
<i>This rude fellow!</i>

168
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,377
<i>Just hold it in.</i>

169
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:22,547
All this nonsense! Rewrite it!

170
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,853
Nobody wants this. If you had the chance,
would you stay in a place like this?

171
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,116
Aren't you getting off work?

172
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,014
Oh, yes, I am.

173
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,126
Did something go wrong?

174
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,167
Hello?

175
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,239
Aigoo, your throat is quite swollen.

176
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,045
Get an injection before you leave.

177
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,413
Ya, did the hospital director not come over?

178
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,484
No, why?

179
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,217
A few days ago, he said his
arm was experiencing numbness.

180
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,834
His arm? Why?

181
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,721
I don't know.

182
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,413
I told him to visit you and have it
checked out. He didn't come, I see.

183
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:46,616
Tomorrow I'll go take a look, and at the
same time, discuss his 70th birthday.

184
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,718
Oh right, he's turning 70 soon.

185
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,931
Exactly. Come over here.

186
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,010
Okay.

187
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,630
Doctor, she's the last patient.

188
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,053
Okay.

189
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,804
Mr. Jo Jae Hee didn't come today either.

190
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,489
Exactly.

191
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,935
Who is Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

192
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:12,968
Just someone, a fake patient who comes often.
I'm curious to know why he's not coming.

193
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,603
A fake patient?

194
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:20,330
I'm getting off work, let's go and have dinner
together. I'll buy you something delicious.

195
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,700
I get it!

196
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:44,099
Looks like I'm just hungry.

197
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:14,561
I don't have any green chillies. If I don't have
any green chillies, I can't make my sauce.

198
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,468
Welcome.

199
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,773
Why in the world, do you
not have green chillies?

200
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,739
If you absolutely must
have it, we can order it.

201
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,595
Goodbye.

202
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,937
Ah, I can't waste any more time.

203
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,069
I can't, I can't.

204
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:47,914
Oh, Yu Jin.

205
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:52,340
Doctor, it's been a while since I've knocked
off early. Do you want to go catch a movie?

206
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:56,976
If it's been so long since you've knocked
off early, don't you need to meet Hyun Kyu?

207
00:19:56,977 --> 00:20:01,512
Recently, I haven't been able to contact him.
Their company seems to be really busy.

208
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:04,203
Ah, I see.

209
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:05,976
What?

210
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,476
Oh, it's nothing.

211
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:12,261
Let's not watch a movie. Let's go do your
house and have dinner, how about that?

212
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,981
Okay. I have to make a trip
to my dad's, how about 7pm?

213
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:21,644
Mm, mm, I'll go buy groceries.

214
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,296
No, why do I have to hold a
70th birthday celebration?

215
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:27,592
Why?

216
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,242
There's no one to invite.

217
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:32,185
Director, how can there be no one to invite?

218
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:38,775
Family, friends, the neighbors, and we
can invite all your regular patients.

219
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,487
I'll throw a grand party for you.

220
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,847
Do you know why people hold
70th birthday celebrations?

221
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:50,618
They gather all their children and
grandchildren, and watch them bustle around,

222
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:55,041
To show their life hasn't been lived in vain,
they've handed in all their assignments,

223
00:20:55,042 --> 00:21:00,478
And now they can enjoy their later years.
It's a celebration.

224
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:04,635
So because I'm not married, you
can't throw a 70th birthday celebration?

225
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:07,386
What I mean is that it has no significance.

226
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:10,952
Director, how about taking a vacation?

227
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,715
Mun Jung, go with him on a trip.

228
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:20,213
I'm really sorry that I can't live
the way you want me to.

229
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,308
But, you're too stubborn too.

230
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,515
As far as family goes, there's only
me and Dad, two people.

231
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,222
Your sudden coldness towards me,
makes me really feel very lonely.

232
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,686
Why don't you get married?

233
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:38,441
I don't want to treat marriage as a goal,
just finding someone to spend my life with.

234
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:43,906
I want to meet someone I love, and lead the
married life I really want. Can't I do that?

235
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:46,592
Can I not have this sort of wishes in my life?

236
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:48,841
How old are you now?

237
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:56,374
Even if I'm 50, or 60,
it doesn't matter to me.

238
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,202
Do as you wish.

239
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:01,209
Yes, you do as you wish too.

240
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,962
I don't wish to be picked on by you anymore
just because of marriage problems.

241
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:09,853
Mun Jung!

242
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,407
I heard your arm was feeling numb.

243
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:21,503
Which arm, to what extent, and how numb?

244
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:24,829
It's an illness only your
getting married can cure.

245
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:35,044
Mun Jung.

246
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:39,189
Director, you really...

247
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,295
When you go home, there's nobody to eat your
cooking, why is your grocery basket so big?!

248
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,641
Right?

249
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:51,399
No matter how you look at it...

250
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,867
What?

251
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,949
Mun Jung seems to have a man in mind.

252
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,280
Who is it?

253
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,973
How old is he, what does he do?

254
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:04,852
Just hold your 70th birthday celebration,
and stop torturing the child.

255
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:07,505
What kind of guy is he?!

256
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,821
That...is the draft blueprint ready?

257
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,385
Eh.

258
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,262
Tomorrow, you have to give it to me.

259
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,759
Eh.

260
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,360
Who are you ordering around?

261
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:32,316
It's not like that.

262
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,590
Director, take a look at this.

263
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,337
You have to give me the blueprint by
tomorrow, so I can make the model.

264
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:44,915
Only after that can we confirm the time for
the meeting. If we can't fulfill that schedule...

265
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:48,322
I can definitely finish it by
tomorrow morning, don't worry.

266
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:55,856
I'll go home and do it.

267
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:01,043
Are you okay, Director?

268
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:04,042
Are you working too hard?

269
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,701
Pack up and continue.

270
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,246
Yes.

271
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,375
Do you have a discount card?

272
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,483
No.

273
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,407
Do you have a member card?

274
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,846
[Korea's Employees,
Stand Up and Take A Stretch]

275
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,143
Welcome.

276
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:45,304
Part I of Professor Parnard, it's finally out.

277
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,929
Ah, I don't have time to watch it now.

278
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:24,236
Where are you going?

279
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:27,630
Mr. Jo Jae Hee.

280
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:33,289
I've made a date with Yu Jin to have
dinner at her house. It's been a while.

281
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,067
Say something.

282
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,458
I got scared after hearing
the footsteps of a man.

283
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:45,347
Having nothing to say after greeting you,
wouldn't it be very awkward?

284
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:53,834
See.

285
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:59,898
I'm just angry to the point
where I'm speechless.

286
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:54,978
Then what are you going to do? Is he not
throwing a 70th birthday celebration?

287
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:00,956
Why don't I find a stand-in? Happily find
a fake husband, and over ten fake children,

288
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:03,780
And throw a grand party in front of Dad.
How about that?

289
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:09,655
Doe a deer, a female deer,
Ray, a drop of golden sun.

290
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:12,914
But, why are there three chickens?

291
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,921
Oh, just leave one in the freezer, we can eat
it in the future. It was cheaper to buy three.

292
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,801
Do you want to eat samgyettang*?
[*ginseng chicken soup*]

293
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:30,723
I heard you were really busy at work,
I bought it for you to keep your health up.

294
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:35,050
I'm not busy to the point where I
need to keep my health up.

295
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:40,953
No, let's just cook this one as well,
and take it over for Ahjussi to eat.

296
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:44,583
Let's take the samgyettang and
rush into Ahjussi's house.

297
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:48,362
Are you really that curious
about Mr. Jo Jae Hee's house?

298
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,583
I did take a little peek at it.

299
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:52,692
How?

300
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:57,990
I took a little peek through the door before
it closed, before I was chased out.

301
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:02,184
How should I put it? It's a lot more elegant
than I imagined, and really presentable.

302
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,823
Really?

303
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,960
Were there no skeletons that he was hiding?

304
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,932
What?

305
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:26,216
I need the dimensions of the paper.
Please send it to the mailbox. Thank you.

306
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,668
I get it.

307
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:31,331
You absolutely have to pass me
the blueprint tomorrow morning.

308
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,817
Your progress is smooth, right?

309
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,844
Of course. I will immediately
send it to your mailbox.

310
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:42,828
Take a look towards the pantry.

311
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,219
There's a ghost of a baby looking at you.

312
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:57,064
What an arrogant fellow. Who does
he think he's ordering around?

313
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:00,743
Aye, how old is he already.

314
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,116
Wagner.

315
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,272
Mendelssohn.

316
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,482
Sadi.

317
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,602
Sadi.

318
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,552
Ah, I have to play the music.

319
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:01,935
This fellow, again!

320
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,456
Doctor Jang Mun Jung.

321
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,879
Yes.

322
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,492
Have you eaten?

323
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,852
No, why?

324
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,337
We've made samgyettang.

325
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:17,939
Are they leftovers again?

326
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,817
No, they're not leftovers. Two drumsticks,
two wings, it's a whole chicken.

327
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:27,536
Then, because of your sincerity,
I'll come over and get it.

328
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:29,635
No, we'll come over.

329
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:33,005
No, I'll go over.

330
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:37,102
What is the reason that you won't
let outsiders into your house?

331
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:39,820
I...

332
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:45,563
At least in my house, I wish to be released
from the constraints of human relations.

333
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:49,820
Omo, are your human
relations that complicated?

334
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:53,824
Everyone needs a sanctuary
that belongs to himself.

335
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,564
Yes, I get it.

336
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:59,763
Then please walk out of your sanctuary, a
nd head towards our humble abode.

337
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,656
Sanctuary? Did he call his
house a sanctuary?

338
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:06,608
Ah,

339
00:31:07,305 --> 00:31:11,145
On my way home I bought a sandwich.
I want to eat that.

340
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:13,800
Do as you wish then.

341
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,486
Failed.

342
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:22,443
Wow, I'm getting more and more curious.
How in the world do we get in?

343
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:27,189
I give up. Yu Jin, you come up
with a battle plan yourself. Let's eat!

344
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:37,127
Jae Hee!

345
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:43,805
Hyun Kyu, I've brought you
your favorite bread with cream.

346
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:45,692
Eat first.

347
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,476
How's everything going?

348
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,472
Even though I'm really grateful,

349
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:52,696
Why do I get the feeling that I'm being reared as a pet?

350
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:55,057
Where are you going?

351
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,952
There's a place I have to go.

352
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:01,507
I'm leaving today, and will be
back on Saturday. Is that okay?

353
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:03,829
What would you do if it's not okay?

354
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,863
I'll send you the drawings for the bookstore.

355
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:10,345
Please send the plans for the
main building bedroom also. Quickly.

356
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,258
I know, I know.

357
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:21,398
Are you guys able to handle it?

358
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:28,208
What...?!

359
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,446
Hey!

360
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:34,833
Clean up before you start working.

361
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,239
Look what the office is turning into!

362
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,161
Alright.

363
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,648
I haven't been wasting my time
loafing around, Director!

364
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,569
I've already worked through the night
in this office for the past few days!

365
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,852
It's just a little messy,
must you grumble about it?

366
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:53,876
What did you just say?!

367
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:55,939
I'll clean up before I go.

368
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,016
Hyun Kyu, eat up. Eat up.

369
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:15,277
Jae Hee, you know Mr. Song Byung Gu,
don't you?

370
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:17,630
Samsa's boss, Mr. Song?

371
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,130
What about him?

372
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,807
They seem to have a lot of free time,

373
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:25,607
So if you can't handle the project, you might
want to find someone to take over.

374
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:28,208
What are you saying now?

375
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,038
Are you sure you're okay?

376
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,110
Once you begin, you'll just have to
keep going. So what if I'm not okay?

377
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:36,890
Spouting nonsense so early in the morning.

378
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,187
She's just worried about you, isn't she?

379
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:41,634
Do you have to say such mean things?

380
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:42,684
You rascal, you!

381
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:44,030
Hey, Hyun Kyu!

382
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,391
Out, out.

383
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:46,812
Go and get some fresh air!

384
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:48,449
Quickly!

385
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,231
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

386
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,194
Excuse me...

387
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:21,812
Would you mind lending me your card?

388
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,149
Hey,

389
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:28,579
There's a man waiting for you outside.

390
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,184
Who is it?

391
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,402
Go see for yourself.

392
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:38,691
Yu Jin!

393
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:53,721
You look like a vagabond.

394
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:56,142
How much midnight oil have you burnt?

395
00:35:56,228 --> 00:35:58,318
I haven't been home for 10 days,

396
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:02,406
And out of that 10 days,
I worked 24 hours for 7 of them.

397
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,008
Director Jo cannot treat me like this!

398
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:06,540
When he works late, I have to
work through the night.

399
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:09,355
When he works through the night,
I have to work the entire weekend!

400
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:11,712
Is your line of trade always this tough?

401
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,978
We have to work harder
when there are more projects.

402
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,853
Is your job really so interesting?

403
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:18,597
Why are you asking all these
old-fashioned questions?

404
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:20,934
Hey, you're really funny.

405
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:21,791
What about?

406
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,494
You don't take calls when you're working.

407
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,355
You don't reply to texts either.

408
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:28,640
I can't be bothered when I'm busy.

409
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:32,070
So you completely disappear in times like that?

410
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:35,735
But I will pay you sudden visits like this.
Doesn't it make you happy?

411
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,306
You are really thick-skinned.

412
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:42,360
I'll just sleep here for 30 minutes
before going back.

413
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:45,085
The air is really fresh...

414
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,307
You're going to sleep in the open
like a homeless person?

415
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:50,031
Hey, I will look like I'm homeless
if you're not here,

416
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,064
But since you are,

417
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:53,728
This will be a pleasant afternoon
scene with a beautiful lady.

418
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:55,873
I will let you have 30 minutes.

419
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,701
I have to get back before lunch hour is over.

420
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:00,959
Can I rest on your lap?

421
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,105
Go away.

422
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:08,134
Give me some bus fare
for me to go back.

423
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,419
Want my lap?

424
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:20,748
How much do you want?

425
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,999
Take a copy of this.

426
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:35,863
Park Hyun Kyu!

427
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,029
He's not back yet?

428
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,973
What's wrong with me?

429
00:38:11,682 --> 00:38:14,961
Where did he go again?

430
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,605
Director!

431
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:21,826
Director! Director, what's wrong?

432
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:22,639
Director!

433
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,388
Director!

434
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,687
We're sending an emergency patient over.

435
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:29,892
Director!

436
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,567
Director...

437
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:35,015
Director...please open your eyes...

438
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,996
What's going to happen to our Director?

439
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,382
Doctor, the blood pressure...

440
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:48,737
Move the patient.

441
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:51,716
Doctor, is our Director going to be alright?!

442
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:58,704
This fella...
Does he think he's still a young man?

443
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:02,941
Does he think his body is going to handle
burning so much midnight oil at this age?

444
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:04,721
What time is it now?

445
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,899
He's awake.

446
00:39:08,742 --> 00:39:12,087
Director, are you okay?

447
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:16,699
Why are you here?

448
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,037
What are you doing when
we're already so busy?

449
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:22,060
Oppa, he brought you here.
What are you doing?

450
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,648
Give me a hand.
I'm going back to work.

451
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:29,912
Stay still!

452
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:33,532
You have to rest for at least 3-4 days.

453
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,084
It's a cardiac arrhythmia.

454
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,974
Your blood pressure has always been low.

455
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,098
I just need to have a sleep.

456
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,618
You are really...!

457
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,634
Oppa!

458
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:43,651
You can take a rest now.

459
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:45,946
I've discussed it with Manager Yun.

460
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:50,351
We've decided to pass the Ogin-dong
refurbishment project to Samsa.

461
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,180
What did you just say?

462
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:56,249
Who asked you to give that project
away without permission?

463
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,385
We haven't got a choice,
under the circumstances.

464
00:39:58,386 --> 00:39:59,650
What circumstances?

465
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,307
You've got the experience so you're complaining
about having too much work to do, aren't you?

466
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:04,245
Then quit!

467
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:11,131
How can you say such things?

468
00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:12,706
If we want to keep up
with our schedule,

469
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:15,335
We'll be working through the
night for the next one month.

470
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:17,688
How can you handle it in
your current condition?

471
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:20,478
Who wants you to worry
about my health?

472
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:24,221
Who, in this world, will get someone else
to worry about their own health?

473
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:28,550
I'm just doing this subconsciously.
I just care about you, that's why.

474
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,990
Director, how can you obliterate
other people's kindness like this?

475
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,774
How can you be so self-centred?

476
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:36,379
Since there are so many things
which you're unhappy about,

477
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,035
How can you still work under me?

478
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,007
Leave then!

479
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,970
Go to a place that makes you feel better!

480
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:46,105
I don't need someone like you!

481
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:49,995
Yes, I get it!

482
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:54,567
Oppa!

483
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,788
Both of you should get out too.

484
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:10,790
<i>That's why he can't get married!</i>

485
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,905
<i>Just bear with it...</i>

486
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:13,405
<i>Come home earlier today!</i>

487
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:14,947
<i>Alright.</i>

488
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,447
Don't enter when you
have no business.

489
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,845
That's for the doctor to decide.

490
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,506
You have been having headaches
lately, haven't you?

491
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:39,324
For someone who keeps coming
to the hospital for no reason,

492
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:41,982
Why don't you want to come
here when you're truly ill?

493
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:47,093
I was busy with work so everything
else has to fit in with the schedule.

494
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:51,657
I don't rest when I have to work.

495
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:55,182
So you were taking a rest during those times
when you were visiting the hospital?

496
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,235
Hospital is not a place where you come for
leisure, it's where you come when you're ill.

497
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:03,428
Does our Jae Hee visit you
very often, Doctor Jang?

498
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,849
How do you do?

499
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,161
What are you doing here?

500
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,957
Haven't you thought about getting married
after going through something like this?

501
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,774
Absolutely not.

502
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,348
Why are you talking about marriage here?

503
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:20,205
You've already been hospitalized
twice this summer.

504
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:23,882
No one would know if you
were to pass out at home.

505
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:27,286
We'll just find a rotting corpse 10 days later.

506
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:29,771
If that's really my fate,

507
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:31,880
Then it's not a bad way to die either.

508
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,989
What? You rascal!

509
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:12,912
I swore this would never happen again
after I did it for Kim Tae Il...

510
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:15,220
Do you have a discount card
or membership card?

511
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,411
Please hold on.

512
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,897
Where is it...?

513
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:21,285
Membership card.

514
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:23,210
Hey!

515
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,676
Thank you!

516
00:43:33,629 --> 00:43:35,397
Something feels wrong.

517
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:38,177
Don't tell me that I'll soon be
following behind his back,

518
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:41,314
Paying for his pool games
and internet cafe costs?

519
00:45:10,994 --> 00:45:14,297
Please make some noise next time!

520
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:19,142
Why are you walking around
instead of sleeping?

521
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:22,398
I can't sleep because
there's someone else there.

522
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:24,534
It's not any stranger.

523
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:28,111
Can't you even stand sleeping in the
same room with your own mother?

524
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,997
This is my space.

525
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:42,440
This is Doctor Jang's holy ground?

526
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:48,378
Don't you feel embarrassed using
such a preposterous term?

527
00:45:48,698 --> 00:45:54,499
Old maids usually view their
workplace as their holy ground.

528
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,586
Director,

529
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,842
Doctor,

530
00:45:56,843 --> 00:45:58,343
Professor,

531
00:45:58,344 --> 00:46:01,449
Because titles like these provide security.

532
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,055
That seems to be the case.

533
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:08,782
Because of your insecurity of
being unable to marry,

534
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:10,487
And of being unable to be a mother,

535
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:15,785
- So you become a Doctor to...
- If that's all, can you leave my holy ground?

536
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:18,146
I'd like to take a rest now.

537
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:25,184
Let's see...

538
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,717
Isn't there anything worth reading?

539
00:46:34,514 --> 00:46:36,023
Travel safely.

540
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:38,993
Let's go.

541
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,060
What?

542
00:46:57,284 --> 00:47:00,215
I thought you're still mad so you
wouldn't answer, but you did.

543
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:04,140
I just met with the Ogin-dong client and told
her we won't be able to take the job.

544
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,118
You're doing according to
what you want, so go ahead.

545
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,931
I feel that it's a pity too because
you work so hard for it.

546
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:12,251
The client was very pleased
with your design.

547
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:13,878
That goes without saying.

548
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:17,893
She was very disappointed because
her hopes were very high.

549
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,361
I have to leave for the countryside now.

550
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:23,190
I rushed here without finishing my business.

551
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:24,433
Go.

552
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:26,596
Take good care of yourself.

553
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:30,242
I wanted to visit you before
I leave, but the flight...

554
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,071
Heartless fella.

555
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,591
What?

556
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,224
He hung up before I could even finish.

557
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:45,190
He always behaves like this,
not just in the past 1 or 2 days.

558
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:46,733
But why didn't he mention me?

559
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:49,374
Didn't you say that you were going to
confront him about firing me?

560
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:53,624
Hey, let's just quit, shall we?

561
00:47:54,189 --> 00:47:56,102
I don't want to.

562
00:47:57,913 --> 00:48:00,251
Who can I trust?

563
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,287
You still have me, right?

564
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:28,694
<i>Tell him to wait and see.</i>

565
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,059
What is it?

566
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,738
What does this text mean?

567
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:46,809
Don't pass the Ogin-dong project to others.

568
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,996
I started it, so I want to see it
through to the end.

569
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:52,051
What?

570
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,183
Well, he just escaped.

571
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:00,778
This man is really...

572
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:18,985
No matter how unique he is,
a man will still be a man.

573
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:23,597
Doctor, I think Mr. Jo Jae Hee
left this behind.

574
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:44,397
Now that I've done this,

575
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,195
The headache seems to ease up a bit.

576
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,866
Time to begin.

577
00:50:14,513 --> 00:50:17,032
Where did it go?

578
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:28,112
Who is it?

579
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:30,221
This is Jang Mun Jung.

580
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:32,321
I don't have time for you right now.

581
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,188
I'm sorry I ran away
from the hospital, happy?

582
00:50:34,189 --> 00:50:36,551
You must find time for me.

583
00:50:37,574 --> 00:50:41,244
The thing that contains your
Ogin-dong drawing is in my hand.

584
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:45,910
You sound very flustered right now,
so that must be something important.

585
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:47,637
It is important.

586
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:50,506
All my work is inside.

587
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,946
Give it back to me right now.

588
00:50:52,947 --> 00:50:54,991
There is a condition.

589
00:50:57,312 --> 00:50:59,292
Please go ahead.

590
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:02,406
I am going to your house.
Let me perform a check up on you.

591
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:03,478
Eh?

592
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:06,564
Let me check your heart rate and
measure your blood pressure.

593
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:10,034
If I don't find anything abnormal,
I'll allow you to work.

594
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:12,843
Allow? What right do you have, Doctor Jang?

595
00:51:12,844 --> 00:51:14,878
What are you going to do?

596
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:17,855
Did you say you want to enter my house?

597
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:21,172
Have you not entered my space at
your leisure too, Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

598
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:24,230
Is that the same as this?!

599
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,426
If you have the time, then
come to the hospital.

600
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:27,297
I do not have time!

601
00:51:27,298 --> 00:51:29,914
Do I look idle?!

602
00:51:29,915 --> 00:51:33,410
Then I will just have to come to you.

603
00:51:44,693 --> 00:51:46,707
Please come as soon as possible.

604
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:50,206
I can't do any work
without the memory stick.

605
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:53,451
I'm right outside.
Please open the door for me.

606
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:21,891
I'm here.

607
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:23,214
You are here.

608
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:26,118
If it's possible at all, how about
stopping your work altogether?

609
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,541
You've brought the USB key, haven't you?

610
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:29,733
I have it with me.

611
00:52:29,734 --> 00:52:32,042
I want to see the goods first.

612
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:47,653
Doctor!

613
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:48,861
Ahjussi, you're back!

614
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:55,679
Hey, open the door!
How can you do that?!

615
00:52:56,152 --> 00:52:58,119
Very funny.

616
00:52:58,589 --> 00:52:59,558
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, open the door!

617
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:00,625
How can you do this?!

618
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:01,738
What's going on, Doctor?

619
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:02,733
He tricked me.

620
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:03,816
Mr. Jo Jae Hee!

621
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:05,566
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, open the door!

622
00:53:22,428 --> 00:53:24,315
This is really infuriating.

623
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:26,629
You must be hopping mad.

624
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:30,665
Even so, I won't give up on the check-up.

625
00:53:35,628 --> 00:53:37,196
It's Hyun Kyu.

626
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:38,740
Hyun Kyu?

627
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:46,994
He's definitely in there, isn't he?

628
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:47,977
That's right.

629
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:49,974
Then why isn't he answering the phone?

630
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:51,133
First of all,

631
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:54,962
Hyun Kyu, tell him you have something
important to discuss so he opens the door.

632
00:53:54,963 --> 00:53:57,319
Then Yu Jin will grab and
hold on to the door,

633
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,782
And Hyun Kyu, you will
push Mr. Jo Jae Hee aside.

634
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:02,205
We will then enter through the opening.

635
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,307
Okay?

636
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,839
- Okay!
- Okay!

637
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:13,369
Wait...

638
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,393
What was that?

639
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:19,161
Don't tell me he fainted again?

640
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:22,555
Director! Director...!

641
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:23,397
- Mr. Jo Jae Hee!
- Director!

642
00:54:23,398 --> 00:54:24,492
Ahjussi!

643
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:26,663
- What to do?!
- The balcony.

644
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:27,734
- Balcony?
- Balcony!

645
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:29,702
Director!

646
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:40,582
Do you hear anything?

647
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,790
I can't hear anything at all.

648
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:45,361
What's going on?

649
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,161
When I passed out the last time,

650
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:49,897
Ahjussi climbed over the wall to get in.

651
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:51,462
Really?!

652
00:55:00,762 --> 00:55:03,165
Why are you looking at me?

653
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,573
I can't do it!

654
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:19,798
Here it is!

655
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:21,926
Emergency hide-out!

656
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,305
If we break this down, we can get through!

657
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:27,054
Out of the way!

658
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,462
Help me out!

659
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,453
Sorry Yu Jin! I'll compensate you for this.

660
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:44,300
What's this?

661
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,253
Can we get through now?

662
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,268
Let me go first! I'll go first.

663
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,559
Be careful.

664
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:56,317
- Help me! I...
- Careful, careful...

665
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:57,565
Yu Jin! Yu Jin!

666
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:04,981
There he is!

667
00:56:05,514 --> 00:56:06,718
- Ahjussi!
- Mr. Jo Jae Hee!

668
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,630
- Director!
- Mr. Jo Jae Hee!

669
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,001
- Director!
- Ahjussi

670
00:56:10,002 --> 00:56:12,542
- Mr. Jo Jae Hee!
- Director!

671
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:13,623
Get up!

672
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:15,017
Mr. Jo Jae Hee!

673
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:16,252
Ahjussi!

674
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:18,102
Mr. Jo Jae Hee! Get up!

675
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:20,440
Director!!

676
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:21,407
Ahjussi!!

677
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:25,227
Mr. Jo Jae Hee...!

678
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:27,660
Open the door! Door!

679
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:29,690
Open the door!

680
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:31,956
Hurry up and open the door, Ahjussi!

681
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:35,640
- Hurry!
- Mr. Jo Jae Hee, open up!

682
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:38,260
Director, what are you doing?

683
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:40,513
Ahjussi, are you okay?

684
00:56:40,514 --> 00:56:42,260
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, door! Door!

685
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:43,505
Here, here, here...

686
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:44,523
That's it, that's it!

687
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,304
Open the door! Door!

688
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:47,474
Here, here...

689
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,127
You broke my wall...!

690
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:52,988
Please open the door! Door!

691
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:54,991
Ahjussi!

692
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:56,240
Where did he go?!

693
00:56:58,099 --> 00:56:59,453
Mr Jae Hee! Open the door!

694
00:56:59,454 --> 00:57:00,555
Ahjussi.

695
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:01,842
Director!

696
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:11,536
What exactly are you trying to do?!

697
00:57:11,581 --> 00:57:14,117
- You actually broke through other people's wall!
- Please open the door.

698
00:57:14,118 --> 00:57:15,559
You are so irritating.

699
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,108
How can I compare with you?

700
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:18,689
Please open up!

701
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:20,494
Sangu!

702
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,079
Where did he go?

703
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:23,784
Sangu!

704
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,283
You can't drink my milk! Shoo! Shoo!

705
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,700
Get out, all of you!

706
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:50,505
Director, you can't do this by yourself.

707
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:54,216
You can fire me after this
project is done, alright?

708
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:57,101
Just go home and sleep tonight.

709
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,294
We'll sort it out from tomorrow onwards.

710
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:03,297
And, bring some medicinal plaster
to the office tomorrow.

711
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,884
Shall I buy some yanggeng* too?
[*sweet jelly made from beans*]

712
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:09,834
That! Sort that out before you leave!

713
00:58:18,515 --> 00:58:20,479
Let me give you a hand!

714
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:21,409
- Be careful...
- Hey,

715
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,350
There's nothing special about his house at all.

716
00:58:25,974 --> 00:58:27,362
Wait a minute,

717
00:58:27,363 --> 00:58:28,911
Where's the Doctor?

718
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,051
Huh?

719
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:36,049
There had better not be any loopholes.

720
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:53,931
What are you doing?!

721
00:58:53,932 --> 00:58:56,461
I am going to perform a check-up.

722
00:58:56,462 --> 00:58:57,468
Doctor Jang!

723
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:00,931
Didn't you say you have to continue with your
work even if it means escaping from the hospital?

724
00:59:00,932 --> 00:59:05,390
Please let me take good
care of my patient too.

725
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:43,149
Are you so happy to be able
to work with Ahjussi?

726
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,957
Shall I buy some yanggeng too?

727
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:47,752
You were really excited.

728
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:51,184
Hey,

729
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,261
Do you know what my dream is?

730
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:55,021
What is it?

731
00:59:55,346 --> 00:59:58,373
There's a land where I really
want to build a house upon.

732
00:59:58,374 --> 00:59:59,380
Yu Jin,

733
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,480
Hey! What are you doing?!

734
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,308
Let me take a look at your chest.

735
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:09,369
Eh?

736
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,831
What's wrong?

737
01:00:14,589 --> 01:00:16,482
I have to pull this up, right?

738
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:34,890
<i>Hey! You are so dead!</i>

739
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:38,206
<i>All I did was kiss you!
What's wrong with it?!</i>

740
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:40,211
<i>Even elementary school kids do more
passionate things these days.</i>

741
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:42,109
<i>Yes, I'm still in elementary school. So what?!</i>

742
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,926
Please stop moving.

743
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,739
You have to breathe!

744
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:55,559
How can you hold your breath
when I am performing check-up?

745
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,132
How long do you have to do this for?

746
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:58,992
I'm almost done.

747
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:33,968
Why is your heart beating so fast?

748
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:39,617
I told you not to hold your breath.
Why do you keep doing it?

749
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,663
What are you doing?

750
01:01:52,162 --> 01:01:53,982
It's too noisy next door.

751
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:13,198
Quick! Let's wrap this up quickly.

752
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:15,613
Your blood pressure is higher than normal,

753
01:02:15,614 --> 01:02:18,454
And heart beat...

754
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:21,488
Have you ever felt like vomiting?

755
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:22,733
No.

756
01:02:23,859 --> 01:02:26,901
We just have to play safe.

757
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,749
Remember to take your medicine on time.

758
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,359
Thank you for taking the trouble.

759
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,367
Quick...

760
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:36,799
I'll leave! I am leaving.

761
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:41,735
You are already 40, so you
cannot work like you used to.

762
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:45,074
I am 40. I will be more watchful.

763
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:52,504
I am leaving! Just let me tidy up.

764
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:54,678
<i>It really hurts!</i>

765
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:56,456
<i>What crime have I committed?</i>

766
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,269
<i>What are you looking?</i>

767
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,845
<i>Where were you looking
when you were kissing me?</i>

768
01:02:59,846 --> 01:03:02,427
<i>What did I see? I didn't see anything!</i>

769
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:04,164
<i>You're looking, you're still looking!</i>

770
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:06,503
<i>You pervert! I'm going to kill you!</i>

771
01:03:06,504 --> 01:03:08,073
Um...

772
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:12,617
Well then...

773
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,215
<i>You're really too much!</i>

774
01:03:25,216 --> 01:03:27,707
<i>How can lovers not kiss?</i>

775
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:28,855
<i>You must be crazy!</i>

776
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:31,845
<i>Hey! Let go!</i>

777
01:03:37,518 --> 01:03:44,122
Um...I don't think it's very convenient
for me to go over right now.

778
01:03:44,123 --> 01:03:44,861
Even so...

779
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,284
I'll go back when the
situation has settled down.

780
01:03:47,285 --> 01:03:49,919
I'll sit here for the time being.

781
01:03:57,406 --> 01:04:01,529
They are young people indeed...

782
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:05,893
Would you please give
me a glass of water?

Are you really going to chase me out like this?

791

<i>You should be able to find it on the internet.</i>

792
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:46,517
I don't do interior renovation.

793
01:04:46,518 --> 01:04:49,067
Where did such an ill-mannered
rascal come from?

794
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:50,700
<i>How good is this!</i>

795
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:53,518
<i>It proves that Director is also a healthy man.</i>

796
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,796
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

797
01:04:54,797 --> 01:04:56,422
<i>Father, please don't contact Mr. Jo Jae Hee.</i>

798
01:04:56,423 --> 01:04:58,285
<i>Do you really want to
embarrass your daughter?</i>

799
01:04:58,286 --> 01:04:59,521
<i>Just do as I say.</i>

800
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:02,018
<i>Daddy, what kind of place is Crazy Horse?</i>

801
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:03,786
<i>That man intends to remain celibate.</i>

802
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:05,223
<i>The type that Father hates.</i>

803
01:05:05,224 --> 01:05:07,609
<i>An abhorrent, reactionary, anti-social egoist.</i>

804
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,726
<i>He's here? Choong Chul is here?</i>
