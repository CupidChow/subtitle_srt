3
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:38,958
Doctor.

4
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,342
What's wrong?

5
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:56,040
Let's go in first.

6
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:39,756
<i>That means right after you get off work,
you sell clothes at night?</i>

7
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,065
<i>Yes.</i>

8
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,754
If you need money so urgently,
you could let me know.

9
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,637
It hasn't been long
since we've known each other.

10
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:52,038
How could I borrow so much money?

11
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:56,459
I'll lend you the money first,
just pay off the credit service.

12
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,086
No, it's fine.

13
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:02,122
Just do as I say.
And stop working a part-time job.

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,793
Focus and work hard at the company.

15
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:10,387
I have the ability to lend you that money,
understand?

16
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:13,199
Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,947
I will get my pay, and return it to you.

18
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,385
I know.

19
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:22,575
What do you think about
going to greet Jo Jae Hee sshi?

20
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:25,108
<i>He was worried about you too.</i>

21
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:30,230
<i>To be honest,
I never want to see that ahjusshi again.</i>

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,055
<i>He's such a strange guy.</i>

23
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,330
When did I ever ask him to lend me money?

24
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,464
He brought the money over and pissed me off.

25
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,074
Even so, Yu Jin...

26
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:44,134
He's not family, and lending money
to a neighbor that he hasn't known for long,

27
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:46,152
isn't something easy.

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,837
The way that person
talks is a little annoying,

29
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,338
but he does look quite kind, right?

30
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:58,146
To be honest, he shouldn't be called kind.

31
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,471
Pointing out others flaws to hurt them,
being sarcastic to them.

32
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,376
Its not that ahjusshi doesn't
want to get married, but can't get married.

33
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,167
What kind of woman would
want to marry that ahjusshi?

34
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:15,033
Aigoo, no matter what, I believe he doesn't
want to get married. He's so strong-willed.

35
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,176
<i>That ahjusshi,
has never been a relationship before, right?</i>

36
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,246
<i>It should be. He doesn't look
like he's been in a relationship before.</i>

37
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:25,068
<i>His eyeballs don't have any trace of love.</i>

38
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,683
<i>I just remembered that movie...</i>

39
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,684
<i>The man who has never been
a relationship, even till he was 40.</i>

40
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,844
<i>Oh yes!</i>

41
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,442
<i>Wasn't there a comedy like that?</i>

42
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,533
If they made that novel into a horror movie,
it should be quite good, right?

43
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:41,513
Sanggu, what's wrong?

44
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,410
It has to be changed.

45
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,535
What has to be changed?

46
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,617
Oh, there has been a few
changes on the blueprint.

47
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:53,487
Aigoo, we don't even have enough time.

48
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,248
It should be able to be changed by Sunday.

49
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,588
Working again on Sunday?

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,234
By tomorrow, it's been the
third consecutive weekend at work.

51
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,015
Don't I pay you?

52
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,643
The two of you prefer to come
to work rather than stay at home,

53
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:08,606
but I would like to spend
Sunday as a rest day.

54
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,538
Like a rest day...

55
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,938
Date?

56
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,699
I would like to do that.

57
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,478
Going out on a rest day..

58
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,479
in the end you'll still be
hit and stepped on by others.

59
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,513
On such a hot day, after such conflicts,
you'll be in a bad mood too.

60
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,607
Why not just come to work in the office...

61
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,308
where there's air-conditioning, how fun.

62
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,818
It's not that fun.

63
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:32,482
I know. What can we do if it's so busy?
I'll come to work.

64
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,405
Forget it.

65
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,392
Eh?

66
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:37,999
The thing that is waving in
front of your eyes, is still someone.

67
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:41,255
<i>I'll just work and rest at the same time.</i>

68
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,344
I have to bring a few CDs.

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,783
Playing music loudly here,
shouldn't incur people to gossip about me.

70
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:55,064
What this friend is trying
to say is that you don't need to come.

71
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:59,567
He's just saying in a long-winded
way that you can rest, understand?

72
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,809
Then you should say that simply.

73
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,483
<i>I said it.</i>

74
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,209
Aye, to be a youth again is quite good.

75
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,129
Besides shopping,
I have nothing else to do on the weekend.

76
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:14,241
Should I change my phone?

77
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,689
Then I'll make an appointment with someone.

78
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,130
I'll come. Even though there's
nothing much I can help you with..

79
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,831
I'll come over and accompany you.

80
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,719
You don't have to do that.

81
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,795
Is there anywhere you want to go?

82
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,036
The amusement park?

83
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:35,591
The amusement park? How fun!

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,983
Ah, go to that one,
the one that opened just last month.

85
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:40,701
Hold on.

86
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:43,792
How can you eavesdrop
on someone else's conversation?

87
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:48,401
There will be great weather this Sunday,
not a trace of clouds.

88
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,262
The highest temperature
recorded for the last 16 years.

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,420
The amusement park
that just opened last month...

90
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,921
will be busy receiving
families as their guests.

91
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,672
<i>He Who Can't Marry</i>

92
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,741
<i>What's Wrong With Spending the Weekend Alone!</i>

93
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,872
<i>This Sunday?</i>

94
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,323
I don't have an appointment.

95
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,255
Okay, I'll come.

96
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,101
Oh, oh.

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,156
Does Doctor Myeong to change shifts again?

98
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,234
It's not a shift, but asking me to help..

99
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,335
look after the patient
who has abdominal pain.

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,016
He says there's a
funeral in his in-laws' family.

101
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,779
Doctor Myeong is going too far.

102
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,944
Every weekend, he always has something on...

103
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,045
and he always finds an
excuse to push it on to you.

104
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:48,550
I'm helping just this once.

105
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,943
- Are you scheduling your leave?
- Yes.

106
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:54,034
When are you going for your summer holiday?

107
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,202
About that.
When the hospital can afford to let me go.

108
00:06:56,322 --> 00:07:00,845
Doctor, stop caring just about the hospital.
Schedule your holiday.

109
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:05,117
That's right! You have to take a break,
that's what the weekend is for.

110
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, why are you all like that?

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,898
When there's an emergency
patient on the weekends,

112
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:12,689
the nurses will call you first,
you don't know that, do you?

113
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,020
Is that so?

114
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,847
Once they call, you'll come.

115
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,969
Other doctors use their family as an...

116
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,070
excuse and immediately
turn their hand phones off.

117
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,345
I'm a bored single, so I'm easy to bully.

118
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,651
It's not that either...

119
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:30,601
You're immediately contactable.
And, when you come, you're never irritated.

120
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,591
That's what I meant by being easy to bully!

121
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:39,136
That's why. You should schedule a holiday,
and enjoy life.

122
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:43,451
Don't bother about Doctor Myeong's
weekend shifts in the future, okay?

123
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,190
You're right. It's not as if the hospital
will collapse because it doesn't have me.

124
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,993
Why should I work like that?

125
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,925
Let's take a look.

126
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,884
What's this? Is there a fireworks festival?

127
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,259
A vacation?

128
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,749
<i>Yes, to Jeju Island for 3 days and 2 nights.</i>

129
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:01,926
<i>Why Jeju Island?</i>

130
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,427
<i>Didn't you say you
wanted to go somewhere else?</i>

131
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:04,528
Me?

132
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,756
I'm not going.

133
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:11,157
We're going with my in-laws.
Because my father-in-law moved house.

134
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,431
Mum, we'll bring you along next time.

135
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:19,169
It's fine. It's hard to find time,
you don't have to take care of me.

136
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:24,278
My son will take me, one day.

137
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,673
Didn't you go see mountains the other time?

138
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:30,742
Is it the same going with
friends and going with family?

139
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:35,057
Going on a family vacation,
the children will just make noise.

140
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,086
The adults will have to
stop their own activities..

141
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,787
Just to satisfy what the children want.

142
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:41,434
It will only be pressurizing,
what fun is there?

143
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,646
You don't have children,
you don't have a family...

144
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:47,647
of course you won't know what fun there is.

145
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,542
That's true.

146
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,486
Even though it's tiring and difficult,
the returns are more important than that.

147
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,670
Even if there's a traffic
jam and the cars can't move,

148
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,546
there will still be plenty of people
going on family vacations on the weekend.

149
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,263
Aigoo, you're right!

150
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:01,251
Ah.

151
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:08,749
The tickets that the neighbors gave us...

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,050
we can't use it because
we're already going on a vacation.

153
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,246
If Oppa needs it, he can use it.

154
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:16,094
There's no one to go with him.

155
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,056
Go with Mum?

156
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,644
I can make some kimbab,
and take some drinks along...

157
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,245
do you want to go on a
family vacation with me?

158
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,088
I have to go to the company on Sunday.

159
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,179
Aye, then give it to your friends.
What a waste to just throw it away.

160
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,000
Really, does this person
look like someone who has friends?

161
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:51,519
Do you want to go to Family World?
Do you want to go?

162
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,878
It's $4.95.

163
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,285
Ah, hold on.

164
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:14,029
The Korean Dairy Association is having
a campaign for customers who buy milk.

165
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,154
Just scratch this.

166
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,875
This is good!

167
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:28,899
Drumroll!

168
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,938
It's more fun this way!

169
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:47,069
Congratulations! It's the fourth prize.

170
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,988
Pick one that you like.

171
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:08,179
The later love comes...

172
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,961
The more passionate it is.

173
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,859
This is the story of a guy who was..

174
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,660
never in a relationship till
he was 40 years old.

175
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,028
It's really good.

176
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,248
It's really good.

177
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,098
Ahjusshi!

178
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:50,764
Doctor Jang helped me,
so the repair bill was settled.

179
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,147
<i>I'm really sorry about yesterday.</i>

180
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:57,453
No matter what,
I was wrong to throw the money.

181
00:11:57,573 --> 00:12:01,575
And,
thank you for worrying about me.

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,002
Can't you say something?

183
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:10,427
I said words that were apologetic
and expressed my gratitude,

184
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:13,991
you should say a little something, right?

185
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:23,375
You didn't sell your dog, as long as
you settled everything, it's fine.

186
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,509
I told you before.
It's not something for sale.

187
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,103
Ahjusshi, do you want to walk
to the front of the apartment with Sanggu?

188
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:35,344
If you experience it for yourself,
you'll understand my feelings.

189
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,585
It's fine.

190
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,145
I really don't understand
what kind of person Ahjusshi is.

191
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:51,800
When I greet you, you told me
not to act like I was familiar with you.

192
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,578
And all of a sudden you want
to lend me 50 thousand dollars.

193
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:59,120
Is Ahjusshi close to me or not?

194
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,791
Why? Do you want to get closer?

195
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,131
I didn't mean that!

196
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,801
Ah, this person,
I really can't communicate with him.

197
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,910
Do you want to go to Family World?

198
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,833
Yes?

199
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:21,507
I have two tickets.

200
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,630
No, no, it's fine.

201
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,326
You don't want to?

202
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:29,276
You want to go with me all of a sudden,
it's really strange.

203
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,037
Go with you?

204
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,684
It's for you.

205
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:35,508
Ah...

206
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,183
Take it or leave it.

207
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,151
Thank you.

208
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:51,913
I wanted to go to the amusement park anyway.
It's great.

209
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:56,306
If only he gave it to me,
so I could appear more gentlemanly.

210
00:13:56,426 --> 00:14:00,041
They are free tickets,
why would you appear gentlemanly?

211
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:02,982
Where and when should we meet on Sunday?

212
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,876
Ya. What are we?

213
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,430
What do you mean?

214
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,504
It doesn't seem like we have
a chance at being lovers..

215
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:14,505
but we're slowly becoming friends.

216
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,406
In your eyes, am I a man...

217
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,607
or just something that entertains
you when you're bored?

218
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,996
I'm not sure.

219
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:27,065
The thing I hate the most are relationships
that are uncertain, so clarify it.

220
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:29,393
Pick one out of the two.

221
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:33,107
I will change my attitude
because of your decision as well.

222
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,971
How will you change your attitude?

223
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,619
If in your eyes, I am a man...

224
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,620
then I will pick you up at
your house on Sunday.

225
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,863
Then, if you're just
entertainment when I'm bored...

226
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,364
we meet at the entrance of
the amusement park?

227
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:50,204
I have to think about that too.

228
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,044
I don't want to waste
my golden years of youth...

229
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,345
on someone whom I don't see as a woman

230
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,206
and is spending time with because I'm bored.

231
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,211
Oh, it's this way.

232
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,327
So, make a decision.

233
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:12,016
Sunday, do you want to
come pick me up at my house?

234
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:16,717
Then from Sunday onwards,
you're my girlfriend.

235
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,284
<i>Sunday, Consultation Break.</i>

236
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,483
Are you here?

237
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:11,679
Excuse me.

238
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:19,367
Yes, are you here?

239
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,693
On Sunday too...

240
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:27,194
Being a doctor is
quite a hard profession too.

241
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:28,617
There's no way around it.

242
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,891
There are also people,
like Jo Jae Hee sshi said...

243
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:33,892
who have to give treatments
and make calls on Sunday.

244
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,002
Go in.

245
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,227
Where and how much does it hurt?

246
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,143
It's uncomfortable right around here.

247
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:50,725
It couldn't be like the day before,
that your belt was too tight, right?

248
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,666
It's different.

249
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,328
Why would it be uncomfortable?

250
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,941
I have something else to do,
so hurry please.

251
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,496
Is it uncomfortable to the
point where you can't do anything?

252
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,750
It's unbearable.

253
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,025
Oh.

254
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,740
This... Will you go and watch it?

255
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:16,852
If I have time,
I'll probably go have a look.

256
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,128
Do you know what are
the chemistry of fireworks?

257
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:22,384
The red is potassium,
the yellow is burning sodium, so...

258
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,853
For someone whose stomach
is hurting unbearably,

259
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:27,493
you're really energetically
talking about fireworks.

260
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,816
You must be having indigestion...

261
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,917
Shall I give you some medicine
to help with your digestion?

262
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:38,201
If it's a serious illness, what should I do?

263
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,290
Should we take some blood to check it out?

264
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:56,759
<i>I'm here!</i>

265
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,555
Why are you here?

266
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:07,409
I brought you some food.
How is it, is it going smoothly?

267
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,273
Oh, if we change the design slightly,
the floor space will get slightly larger.

268
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,898
- Take a look.
- Oh, really?

269
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,676
Here, like this...

270
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,402
Like this.

271
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,498
Oh, it's really good.
It finished quicker than we expected.

272
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,706
D-Day?

273
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,819
What's that? What are you counting down to?

274
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,346
It's a secret.

275
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:43,218
It ended so quickly,
now I have to go watch the show.

276
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:46,116
If you want to go watch it, go.
Why did you come out for?

277
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:49,744
My heart felt a little uneasy
making you work while I went out to play.

278
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,513
You should go somewhere to relax.

279
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,666
I'm fine.

280
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,625
If you want to do your work well,
you have to play well first.

281
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:04,728
Working everyday and staying at home
all the time on weekends, will that work?

282
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:10,142
Occasionally getting away from
your family and the company...

283
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,143
and taking a turn around Seoul can be good.

284
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,297
Find some excitement...

285
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:19,398
so you can release the endless inspiration
that you have hiding inside here.

286
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:26,506
Before when I just touched your finger,
you'd get angry...

287
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:28,707
Now you sit still even when I massage you.

288
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:36,269
To get so close to you, took 8 years.

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,661
If you have something on, leave quickly.

290
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,942
Jae Hee ah,
do you want to watch the show together?

291
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:51,938
I don't want to.

292
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,636
I'm leaving.

293
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,433
Yes!

294
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,717
Doctor.

295
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,542
Tomorrow you definitely have to come back.
And you must eat your medicine.

296
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:20,894
Yes, I understand.

297
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,354
Have a wonderful time.

298
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:23,256
Thank you.

299
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:25,832
Yes. Be safe.

300
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,703
Ah Doctor Myeong, it's me.

301
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:42,055
The patient said she wanted to
make a trip home, so I let her go.

302
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,296
Oh, she's in good condition.

303
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,357

Thanks to you.

321
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:43,106
What a coincidence. Jo Jae Hee
sshi will also take the city bus for a tour.

322
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:45,961
This is my first time.

323
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,610
I take it sometimes.

324
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,177
When the weather is nice, it's enjoyable
and I can walk a little more too.

325
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,796
I find something else along
the roads I take everyday.

326
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,363
I understand.

327
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,153
There are only two of us that
are taking the bus by ourselves.

328
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:04,824
Doctor Jang bought one ticket,
so there was an empty seat next to you.

329
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:06,842
If I wanted one ticket too, naturally...

330
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:09,643
I would buy the seat that was
next to Doctor Jang.

331
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,423
You're even analyzing it...

332
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,965
Do you typically spend your
weekends like this?

333
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:39,789
Till the end of last year, I used to climb
mountains with my father on the weekends.

334
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:44,812
Jo Jae Hee sshi's family won't
nag at you because of marriage problems?

335
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,625
That's very simple.

336
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,400
Before you are attacked, attack first.

337
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:36,388
- How did you collect it?
- Are you curious?

338
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:39,310
I don't want to be.
Thank you for settling it so quickly.

339
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,672
Did you think I was someone
who wouldn't return money?

340
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,401
Is that the person I've
shown you for the past 5 years?

341
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,877
Don't just take the money. Take everything
that you've given me in the past.

342
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,921
Wow, you're really childish, Kim Tae Hyul.

343
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,681
I'm really childish.

344
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,002
Whatever we've exchanged between
the two of us, let's make mutual swaps.

345
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:07,176
Let's take this opportunity
to organize our feelings...

346
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:10,077
I want to concentrate on my studies.

347
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,098
If you want to be thoroughly organized,

348
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:18,868
Shouldn't you wash these socks and
these T-shirts before bringing them over?

349
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:21,552
That was because I was anxious.

350
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:27,461
This bag, this was also a gift from you,
right? Take it.

351
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:31,583
Okay. Then this, that I received from you,
you can have it back, is that good enough?

352
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:51,971
Then what should we do about this?
Oppa paid $2, I paid $3 in order to buy it.

353
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:53,968
Then just take it.

354
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:56,265
Oh mo, thanks.

355
00:27:57,598 --> 00:28:00,732
Here, is that thorough enough for you?

356
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:06,838
Basically.

357
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,707
Sanggu. Come here.

358
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:17,838
What?

359
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,856
He was my pet originally.

360
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:23,956
Is Sanggu a product? You said you would
let me keep him, regardless of anything!

361
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:25,845
Aren't you coming here?

362
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,041
Aren't you listening to me?

363
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:33,657
Everyone, if you look right,
it is Kwang-Hwa Gate.

364
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:36,855
<i>Because it's under renovation now,
so it's a little hard to see..</i>

365
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:39,256
<i>The door at the entrance is called Hongnye.</i>

366
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:40,321
<i>Yes.</i>

367
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,334
<i>In the middle where the
emperors walked through..</i>

368
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:45,935
<i>at the vertex of Hong Nye,
there is a carved Phoenix.</i>

369
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:50,155
<i>There are 4 entrances to Kyung Bok Palace.</i>

370
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:53,110
<i>On the East gate is the Blue Dragon,
on the West the White Tiger..</i>

371
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:56,111
<i>On the North the Serpent Turtle
and on the South, the Phoenix.</i>

372
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:02,027
Where the master looks, is the central.
Left is east, right is west.

373
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:04,989
That's why the left is dragons
and the right white tigers?

374
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,127
That's right.

375
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,403
<i>Oh, no wonder.</i>

376
00:29:08,523 --> 00:29:13,606
<i>Because Kwang-Hwa Gate is the
South entrance of Kyung Bok Palace...</i>

377
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:15,007
<i>you will find a Phoenix on it.</i>

378
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:17,002
<i>Right in front of Kwang Hwa Gate
are the recently preserved...</i>

379
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,203
<i>statues of the Hae Tae,
a mythical lion/unicorn animal.</i>

380
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:22,523
<i>The Hae Tae were mythical guardians
of the palace against fires.</i>

381
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:23,955
Excuse me?

382
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,415
<i>Yes?</i>

383
00:29:25,952 --> 00:29:27,225
If you follow the written legend...

384
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:30,826
Hae Tae were mythical animals that had
the talent of finding guilty criminals,

385
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:34,592
and eat people who have
wicked hearts in the court.

386
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,465
If you watch historical dramas,

387
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:42,771
you will see that the court officials
have the Hae Tae drawn on their cloaks.

388
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:44,738
It was to ensure that the people who..

389
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,439
entered and exited the court
were of pure and innocent hearts,

390
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,964
which is why it was placed
at the front of Kwang Hwa Gate.

391
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:55,235
The reason for it becoming a mythical animal
that prevents fires only came about later.

392
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,239
What reason was it?

393
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,204
Kwang Hwa Gate became a tragic
structure in the history of Korea...

394
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:00,405
<i>Regarding the Hae Tae...</i>

395
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,560
<i>It was lost in the chaos.</i>

396
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,537
When Japanese imperialists took over,
they destroyed some parts of it.

397
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:13,242
<i>It was affected in the earthquake that
measured 6.25 on the Seismic scale.</i>

398
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,249
The reason why they attached..

399
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,250
the ability to prevent fires
to the Hae Tae is because...

400
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,823
<i>We're already at Cheonggyecheon!</i>

401
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,120
<i>We're at Cheonggyecheon so quickly!</i>

402
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,221
<i>It seems like they're holding
some sort of activity there.</i>

403
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,649
<i>Oh, you're right.</i>

404
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,903
<i>Why are there so many people there?</i>

405
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,958
Oh, what event is that?

406
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:33,543
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what event that is.

407
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:37,591
It's Hi Seoul. It's the Hi Seoul event.

408
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:40,511
<i>How cool.</i>

409
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,411
Could you help me take a look?

410
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:55,331
I don't know what it hit,
it suddenly went black.

411
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,254
Yes.

412
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,441
Today's weather is really good, isn't it?

413
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,493
Yes.

414
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:06,590
Aigoo, your husband is really eloquent.
What does he do?

415
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,001
I'm an architect.

416
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:12,491
Oh, I see.

417
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:13,865
Thank you.

418
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:21,779
Who's husband are you?

419
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,484
That's right.

420
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:29,164
<i>Ahjumma, have a drink.</i>

421
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:34,850
It'll only become a burden to us,
both of you just share and drink it.

422
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,374
Take it, quickly.

423
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,435
Thank you.

424
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:57,514
Ya, Kim Tae Hyul, are you crazy!

425
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:02,519
<i>Ya, when I catch you, you're dead.</i>

426
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,374
Don't you know how fast I run?!

427
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,482
Sanggu!

428
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,864
Ya, Kim Tae Hyul!

429
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:18,453
Yu Jin!

430
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,600
Dog-napper!

431
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:43,810
<i>Ah, it's pretty.</i>

432
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,236
How much is it?

433
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:47,481
<i>$6.</i>

434
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,993
It's an impulse buy, isn't it?

435
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,495
- Wrap it up, please.
- Yes.

436
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:56,695
When you're a tourist,
it's really easy to open your wallet.

437
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:59,077
You will regret it.

438
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,712
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

439
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:05,215
<i>Bye.</i>

440
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:18,475
Ya, Kim Tae Hyul!

441
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:20,622
You're dead when I catch you!

442
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:24,579
Yu Jin ah, Yu Jin ah! Ya, you, stay there!

443
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:30,017
<i>Ya! Stay there!</i>

444
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,181
<i>Ya, Kim Tae Hyul!</i>

445
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,478
<i>Ya! Yu Jin ah, Yu Jin ah!</i>

446
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:45,471
<i>Hello.</i>

447
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:49,926
<i>I'm Hyun Min Eum, who will
introduce Changgyeong Palace.</i>

448
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:57,158
<i>This is my first time as a guide,
so I'm a bit nervous...</i>

449
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,059
<i>If I make any mistakes,
please be understanding.</i>

450
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:08,340
<i>The original Changgyeong Palace was big...</i>

451
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:11,641
<i>just like the model that
everyone is looking at right now.</i>

452
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,342
<i>Before, Changdeok Palace
and Changdeok Palace were combined.</i>

453
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:17,351
Changgyeong Palace!

454
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:19,605
<i>Yes?</i>

455
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,997
You just said Changdeok Palace
and Changdeok Palace.

456
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:25,659
Oh, yes.

457
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,925
Your first day can't be like that.

458
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:53,503
Do you have to do this?
Quickly return Sanggu to me.

459
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:58,103
Anyway, when you're tired of him,
you'll abandon him someplace else.

460
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:03,663
You jerk, why are you running
away with my Yu Jin's dog?

461
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,497
My Yu Jin?

462
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:10,314
Ya, you've gotten a boyfriend so quickly?

463
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:13,319
Who in the world are you?

464
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:17,331
In this situation,
do I still have to make introductions?

465
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,251
You're dressed like the head of a swordfish.

466
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,827
What?! The head of a swordfish?!

467
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,437
You...

468
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:26,507
It's none of your business.

469
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:29,770
You have a boyfriend?!

470
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,548
Yes or no, what business is it of Oppa's?

471
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:43,321
Take it and go.

472
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,387
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?!

473
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:01,810
How embarrassing,
why is he running away with a dog?

474
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,287
Ya, what do you understand about Oppa?!

475
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,219
You still...

476
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,473
You leave too.

477
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:11,845
Ya, Jung Yu Jin.

478
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:16,267
Are you playing with me?
The reason I came was to pick you up.

479
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:21,127
Ya, with this mood right now, would I still
want to go to the amusement park?

480
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:24,347
What should we do about the free tickets?

481
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:28,469
Cheapskate. Ya, use that time to workout.

482
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,787
You run slower than I do.

483
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,833
Why do you suddenly bring that up?!
I work out too!

484
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:40,191
<i>Yanghwadang (Hall) was used exclusively
for receiving guests in the past.</i>

485
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,324
<i>Oh, when there was chaos in the military...</i>

486
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:48,025
<i>the movement of people stopped here.</i>

487
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:54,439
<i>It was damaged during the
war with the Japanese imperialists.</i>

488
00:36:55,984 --> 00:37:00,965
<i>Only the pavilion has been repaired.</i>

489
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:06,858
<i>The 6 forward facing buildings and the..</i>

490
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,959
<i>middle two buildings too have been repaired.</i>

491
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:15,548
<i>The side door has been repaired,
the carvings on the door too.</i>

492
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:22,353
<i>Yanghwadang is
our National Treasure no. 818.</i>

493
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,460
That is Tongmyeongjeon (Hall).

494
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,920
<i>Yes.</i>

495
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,686
<i>Tong Yong Chun is no. 818.</i>

496
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:38,204
<i>In 1834, Tongmyeongjeon
and Yanghwadang were rebuilt.</i>

497
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:45,223
Stop acting like that already,
she's so nervous she's shaking.

498
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:49,528
<i>Now, let's move to the side.</i>

499
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,043
<i>At that side, you can see Jip Bok Heon.</i>

500
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:57,975
Yongmaru (roof ridge).

501
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,624
If you want to see one aspect
of the buildings of our ancestors,

502
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:03,663
there's a special structure
called yongmaru.

503
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:07,857
You see a long structure
at the top of Yanghwadang

504
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:09,016
Yes, that one.

505
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,571
That is what is called a yongmaru.

506
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:14,550
There, see Tongmyeongjeon.
It doesn't have the yongmaru, does it?

507
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,431
<i>- It doesn't, it doesn't.
- Do you know why?</i>

508
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:22,268
<i>That Jip Bok Heon,
is where Jeongjo's son, Crown Prince Sunjo,</i>

509
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:25,938
<i>No, King Jeongju's father and son...</i>

510
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:29,739
<i>King Jeongju's son and grandson were born.</i>

511
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:33,685
<i>Were born.</i>

512
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:40,555
You have to explain all this.

513
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:45,782
Yes. See, here,
Yanghwajeon, is where the concubines stay.

514
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:49,271
Tongmyeongjeon is
where the king and queen stay.

515
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:52,244
<i>And over there in Tongmyeonjeon, is...</i>

516
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:55,308
<i>There are two over there.
Go over there and take a look.</i>

517
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:57,283
<i>Yes, let's go over there and take a look.</i>

518
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:01,512
<i>Also, in Tongmyeongjeon,
King Jeongju personally...</i>

519
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:08,210
That is where King Sunjo was born?

520
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,405
You can go over there too if you like.

521
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,640
On the stage, if the fireworks are lit...

522
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,741
after the sparks will circle
around Tong Yong Chun once..

523
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,151
over there, the flames!

524
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,304
She's crying.

525
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:33,292
What?

526
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:45,079
Let's go over there. Come over.

527
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,036
Why is she crying?

528
00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:59,707
When she was earnestly trying to explain,
you kept butting in and interrupting her.

529
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:02,072
She was already nervous,
yet you couldn't just follow her quietly.

530
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,657
You had to let everyone
know that you were knowledgeable.

531
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:09,393
You just nag the whole day.

532
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:12,012
Can I not nag?

533
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,518
Please stop fighting.

534
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:23,808
It was all because my
explanations were not very good.

535
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:26,854
Oh, look.

536
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:30,460
What? How can someone be like that?

537
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,987
Oh, in a place like that,
a husband and wife should not fight...

538
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:35,623
- We're not married!
- That scared me.

539
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:43,385
This person... Took the bus by herself.

540
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:47,313
She brought along beverages and kimbab,
just like she was on a tour.

541
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:51,318
Jo Jae Hee sshi isn't by himself?

542
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:54,002
I'm alone too,
but the significance is different.

543
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:55,419
How is it different?

544
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,909
I took the bus by myself...

545
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:00,721
In order to inspire myself.

546
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:04,603
Doctor Jang, is alone because you
have no company despite this good weather,

547
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:06,835
so you were sitting by yourself.

548
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:24,385
Why does it always end up this
way when I'm with Jo Jae Hee sshi?

549
00:41:24,505 --> 00:41:27,519
Why do you follow me around
even on weekends and torture me?

550
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,666
That...

551
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:32,306
I'm crazy, why did I take that bus?

552
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,095
<i>That scared me.</i>

553
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,714
I might as well have just
stayed in the hospital and worked.

554
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,296
Hold... Hold on!

555
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,162
Hold... Hold on!

556
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:54,725
Don't follow me!

557
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:07,972
Yu Jin, what are you doing right now?

558
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,480
Where are you?

559
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,677
<i>Kind, my ass.</i>

560
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:19,888
<i>What a nauseating person.</i>

561
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:23,497
If you're really going to
continue acting this way..

562
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:24,798
I'm really going to beat you up.

563
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:27,601
Even though his nature is kind,

564
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:30,327
how long do I have to wait
for him to go to work

565
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,483
It takes a second for a
person to become bad. A second.

566
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:38,897
Me, me, me? I work at the
hospital very sincerely.

567
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:42,716
But... But why am I looked down upon?
Am I that easy to bully?

568
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:45,807
Just because I'm not married, is that a sin?

569
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,608
Jerk. Is he happy treating me like that?

570
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:05,713
Yes. This is all because of Kim Jeong Kyun.

571
00:43:06,615 --> 00:43:10,286
Doctor, I think all this is
because of Korea.

572
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:12,520
Yes.

573
00:43:14,494 --> 00:43:17,822
But... Who is Kim Jeong Kyun?

574
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:24,445
My fiancé.

575
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,012
Oh.

576
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:30,909
The fellow that fancied
someone else and left me.

577
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:34,751
Am I crying right now?

578
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:37,563
Was Doctor betrayed?

579
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:41,144
I see.

580
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:45,470
Yu Jin...

581
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:52,088
Everything that I've earned till now,
I'll give to you.

582
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,743
Sell me a little of your youth.

583
00:43:54,863 --> 00:43:55,926
That much.

584
00:43:56,046 --> 00:43:57,916
Only that much.

585
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:59,376
Frivolous!

586
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:02,372
Just sell me this much.

587
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:06,145
Oh, what's this? A mike?

588
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:08,434
Is there a karaoke machine?

589
00:44:08,554 --> 00:44:10,602
Do you want to sing?

590
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:13,513
Sing! Sing!

591
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:16,260
Sing.

592
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:18,364
Remote control

593
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,664
Yu Jin, go to the fridge,
and get a little more beer.

594
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:28,044
. We have to be completely
drunk for the effects to be better.

595
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:29,503
Okay.

596
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:30,797
Mike.

597
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,557
Plug this in.

598
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,302
Doctor.

599
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:50,440
Mm?

600
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:52,276
When you're home alone..

601
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:57,477
do you turn on the karaoke machine and sing?

602
00:44:57,496 --> 00:45:00,598
<i>Mm. If I go to the Nora bang
with my colleagues from the hospital,</i>

603
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:04,269
<i>I have to maintain an image and it's tiring,
I can't even de-stress by singing.</i>

604
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:09,829
<i>So I sing by myself alone. 489. The best.</i>

605
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:19,176
Please heal me. my heart's already broken.

606
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:26,915
Doctor.

607
00:45:27,035 --> 00:45:29,984
I'll give you three years
of my youth. For free.

608
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:31,245
Really?

609
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:39,887
Yu Jin. My youth relies on you.

610
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:44,824
Doctor, please don't worry.

611
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:01,008
<i>Welcome.</i>

612
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,633
<i>What would you like to drink?</i>

613
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,454
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

614
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:20,005
Alone.

615
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:28,570
Hello.

616
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:29,837
Yes.

617
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:35,331
Are you here alone today as well?

618
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:39,353
Today, you're alone too.

619
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:42,925
- Oppa, you're here already.
- Oh, take a seat.

620
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:46,811
You've already started drinking.

621
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:51,082
Honey, make some time this weekend.
Go on a trip with me.

622
00:46:51,202 --> 00:46:53,057
Why are you acting this way?

623
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,569
There's still a long way to go
before we go on a weekend vacation together.

624
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,527
Didn't you say you wanted
to watch the fireworks festival?

625
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:58,987
But, that's in Yeouido.

626
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,863
<i>There will be some at Bussan too.</i>

627
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:04,847
<i>Fireworks by the sea,
don't you want to see that?</i>

628
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,285
<i>It would be pretty.</i>

629
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:08,570
If you feel some burden by going
on a weekend vacation together..

630
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:09,571
then forget it.

631
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,005
The plane tickets and
rooms have already been booked.

632
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:17,178
<i>We'll do as you please.</i>

633
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:22,588
<i>I saw the fireworks festival
before when I was working at Bussan.</i>

634
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:26,973
At that time, I thought that I
definitely have to see it with my beloved,

635
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:30,730
Watching the fireworks
festival alone is very lonely.

636
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,023
Then I'll watch it with you this year.

637
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:38,016
Okay.

638
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,957
<i>Ah, taste this.</i>

639
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,050
Is this a joke?

640
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,638
Are you not feeling well somewhere?

641
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:02,386
My arm gets numb sometimes.

642
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:04,318
What's going on?

643
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,882
Let Mun Jung take a look at it.

644
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:22,805
Ah.

645
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,918
Why? Are you very uncomfortable?

646
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,012
No.

647
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:39,768
Let's not walk anymore,
let's ride a bicycle...

648
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:40,869
I heard it's good for the knees.

649
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:43,344
See, stop acting like that,
just do the surgery.

650
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,233
I don't want to, I'm scared.

651
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:48,711
And I don't like the idea of
putting man-made materials into my body.

652
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:52,346
Trust your Doctor son-in-law,
he says it's fine.

653
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,450
Stop nagging and eat.

654
00:48:54,772 --> 00:48:56,317
It's almost time for Ye Won to be back.

655
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:57,756
Yeh Won is at the in-laws' place.

656
00:48:57,876 --> 00:49:00,761
They took her out after we came
back from our vacation at Jeju Island.

657
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:04,640
Ye Won did a lot of lovable

658
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:08,804
Mum, it looks like we have
to stay at our in-laws place.

659
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,896
Really? When?

660
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:16,153
Father-in-law told Ye Won's
father that they want to stay together.

661
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,932
If we stay with the in-laws,
what will Mum do when she's bored?

662
00:49:20,052 --> 00:49:23,485
I will live well by myself,
you don't have to worry.

663
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,512
<i>This is Kang Hye Ja sshi right?</i>

664
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,165
Yes, I am Kang Hye Ja.

665
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:29,934
<i>There's a special delivery,
but there's no one at home.</i>

666
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,532
Yes, I'm already there.

667
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:34,636
<i>- Hello.
- Yes.</i>

668
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:36,677
It's a special delivery.

669
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,468
<i>- Please receive it well.
- Yes.</i>

670
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,397
What's up?

671
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:57,127
What?

672
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,133
Doctor Jang Mun Jang sent me a gift.

673
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:01,807
Why?

674
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:08,059
A traditional butterfly brooch.
It looks very expensive.

675
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:13,226
That girl is a good person
from all aspects, that girl.

676
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:18,576
Every time I go to the hospital,
I bring her a little something.

677
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:20,077
That's why she's so thoughtful.

678
00:50:20,796 --> 00:50:22,323
Why did she do something so unnecessary?

679
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:23,804
What's so unnecessary?

680
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:27,883
For me to thank the doctor that performed
a surgery on my son, is not right too?

681
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:31,419
<i>No matter what,
tell her thanks the next time you see her.</i>

682
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:34,534
Don't make her feel like
I'm an impolite old woman.

683
00:50:48,364 --> 00:50:50,971
If you're done looking, let's go.

684
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:54,556
Let's go.

685
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:15,374
We'll wait for you.
The consultation should be over in a while.

686
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,294
Just go back first.

687
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:23,182
Why has he been going to
the hospital so often recently?

688
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:28,656
Is it hypochondria?
It fits his mentality quite well.

689
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:30,717
Hypochondria?

690
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:37,353
How is it he only contracted that
illness after that woman operated on him?

691
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:41,882
Did the surgery not go well?
His piles have been cured, right?

692
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,709
You are...

693
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:48,436
Ignorance is a blessing.

694
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:17,900
Yes.

695
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:23,718
Please come in.

696
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:39,438
Where does it hurt?

697
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:47,817
From yesterday onwards,
I've been in a bad mood.

698
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:52,540
If you phrase it like that,
what can I do about it?

699
00:52:54,782 --> 00:53:00,282
Here, this part is choked up and panicked.

700
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:02,338
The heart.

701
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,375
Why would it be like that?

702
00:53:07,495 --> 00:53:10,930
Do you have any symptoms of throwing up?

703
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:13,538
I'm really sorry.

704
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,674
It's fine.

705
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:25,286
The brooch has been received.

706
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,765
Ah.

707
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:32,939
Every time she comes for treatment,
she brings a little something.

708
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:36,858
I keep accepting,
so my heart feels a little uneasy.

709
00:53:50,758 --> 00:53:52,261
Saturday...

710
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,953
There's a fireworks festival,
you know about it, right?

711
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:00,225
Yes.

712
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,295
Actually...

713
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:07,760
I know a secret place.

714
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:10,371
A secret place?

715
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,990
My own personal fireworks celebration place.

716
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:15,738
Yes...

717
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:19,432
Do you know the Billion Building at Gangnam?

718
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:22,567
I don't.

719
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:26,195
I used to be an assistant in that building.

720
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:30,410
Even though it's on the
6th floor, on the roof..

721
00:54:30,411 --> 00:54:32,311
you can watch the fireworks festival.

722
00:54:33,155 --> 00:54:34,142
Yes...

723
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:38,000
Even though it's a little far, but in
between, there are no other buildings,

724
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,512
and you can see it very clearly.

725
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,710
Ah, is that so.

726
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,303
It's a secret that only I know of.

727
00:54:46,423 --> 00:54:49,866
No one would have thought that
on the roof of a 6th story building,

728
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,357
you could see the fireworks festival.

729
00:54:52,477 --> 00:54:54,009
Yes...

730
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:59,309
Every year, during the fireworks festival,
I will watch it alone on the roof.

731
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:02,915
On someone else's building.

732
00:55:03,035 --> 00:55:07,046
If you give the security guard
some money for cigarettes, it'll be fine.

733
00:55:07,991 --> 00:55:09,687
Is that so.

734
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:31,020
You definitely cannot tell anyone else.

735
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,700
What can't I tell anyone?

736
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:38,560
About the cigarette money?

737
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,741
No.

738
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,794
That you can see the fireworks festival
on the roof of the Billion Building.

739
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,860
Ah, yes.

740
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:57,751
That... But why are you telling me this?

741
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:08,591
Are you...

742
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:12,616
Asking me along to watch it with you?

743
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:15,707
That is...

744
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:21,812
If you want to watch it.

745
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,175
Together.

746
00:56:29,726 --> 00:56:31,273
Oh, what should I do?

747
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:35,374
I made a date with Yu Jin
to watch it with her.

748
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:38,012
Yes?

749
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:45,217
Where are you going to watch it?

750
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:49,661
I don't know. Yu Jin will look for a place.

751
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:55,261
If you ask her,
you might as well not watch it.

752
00:56:55,626 --> 00:56:58,738
Why do you have to
speak ill of other people?

753
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:01,100
That's the truth.

754
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,073
Just wait and see how many people
will be on the streets that day.

755
00:57:05,074 --> 00:57:06,374
Being stepped on, pushed.

756
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:09,386
It's better than watching
it alone in secret.

757
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:13,143
Even though Jo Jae Hee sshi
will never understand that.

758
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:17,586
Is that so.

759
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:20,549
Then forget it.

760
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:24,611
Actually, I prefer it more,
watching it alone.

761
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,064
Oh mo.

762
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:32,921
Wasn't your heart feeling all choked up?

763
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:38,095
It's feeling a lot better already.

764
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:54,208
<i>Ah, yes, thank you.</i>

765
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:55,797
<i>You're back?</i>

766
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,867
<i>The change in the scheduling
and the changes in the construction,</i>

767
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:01,810
<i>I will prepare it before the next meeting.</i>

768
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,162
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

769
00:58:03,785 --> 00:58:06,254
<i>I understand. Thank you.</i>

770
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:11,362
They said they're very
satisfied with the changes.

771
00:58:11,482 --> 00:58:13,101
Of course.

772
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:17,987
What did the hospital say,
why does your stomach hurt all the time?

773
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:19,919
It's psychological.

774
00:58:23,676 --> 00:58:26,209
You guys are free during
the nights on the weekend right?

775
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:28,233
Why? Are we doing something again?

776
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:29,714
Oh, fun.

777
00:58:31,324 --> 00:58:34,179
Manager, just go get married.

778
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,880
Calling your employees out when you
want to have fun on the weekends,

779
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:37,981
What is that?

780
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,096
The client that just called giving us
invitations to the fireworks festival.

781
00:58:43,216 --> 00:58:46,273
He said it will have food and wine,
a party, a party.

782
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:48,613
Oh. Party!

783
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,254
I'm fine.

784
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:51,349
Why?

785
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:52,895
Both of you go.

786
00:58:54,376 --> 00:58:56,158
Director, you're really not going?

787
00:58:56,278 --> 00:58:57,073
Oh.

788
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,058
<i>Manager, can Yu Jin go in his place?</i>

789
00:59:03,178 --> 00:59:05,355
<i>Oh, who is she?</i>

790
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:10,081
<i>Are you going to make me a
third wheel on your date? You can't.</i>

791
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:11,713
<i>Ah Manager.</i>

792
00:59:12,335 --> 00:59:14,439
<i>Manager!</i>

793
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,011
<i>If he wanted to take Sanggu away, it meant
that he wants to keep in contact with you.</i>

794
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:20,774
What a good excuse.

795
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,807
Yu Jin ah, Sanggu is sick.

796
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:26,585
Yu Jin ah, I have to go back to my hometown,
help me take care of Sanggu.

797
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:29,483
Ah, go write a novel, why don't you.

798
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:31,394
How did he get the money?

799
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,375
I didn't ask.
What would I do with that information.

800
00:59:38,969 --> 00:59:40,300
Why?

801
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,797
Party?! Really.

802
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:47,008
What party? What, what?

803
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:50,765
What's there to be excited about,
this small thing.

804
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:55,030
At the river where we can watch
the fireworks festival? How nice.

805
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,873
In our line of work,
we occasionally get invites like these.

806
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:02,630
You should have told me earlier,
I've already made plans with someone else.

807
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,892
- With the dog-napper?
- What?

808
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:08,520
I'm Yu Jin's friend, I can go in her place.

809
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,320
Ya, why don't you come over to our place?

810
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,496
I'm getting off work.

811
01:00:27,616 --> 01:00:28,784
Oh.

812
01:00:28,904 --> 01:00:30,781
Do you still have a lot left to do?

813
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,348
I'm leaving too.

814
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:35,583
Oh, where's Manager Yun?
Are you going alone?

815
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:37,258
We agreed to meet there.

816
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:38,331
Ah.

817
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:40,456
I'm leaving first.

818
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:03,209
Ah, there's a traffic jam right from
the beginning. We shouldn't have driven.

819
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,553
Can we still go?

820
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:08,451
I'm sorry, because we got off work late.

821
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:10,899
Oh, no.
It's fine.

822
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:13,775
But... it's a little tight.

823
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:17,256
There's only an hour left.

824
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:20,133
What should we do?

825
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,081
Excuse me, do you have the time.

826
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,335
You scared me!

827
01:01:44,645 --> 01:01:47,550
You're already 40, who would
look at you sitting here like this?

828
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:51,779
Ya, how is it?
The atmosphere's nice, isn't it.

829
01:01:53,325 --> 01:01:55,643
I should come to these
sort of places with a woman.

830
01:01:55,763 --> 01:01:58,081
Oh, didn't you say you
were bringing your girlfriend?

831
01:01:58,201 --> 01:02:00,141
She said she wasn't coming.

832
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:02,932
Also, you can't call her my girlfriend,
there's been no progress at all.

833
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,739
I'm afraid the ghost that is
sticking to the unmarried..

834
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:10,240
Manager and Director will obstruct my path.

835
01:02:10,568 --> 01:02:12,994
Is there a ghost at my back.

836
01:02:13,114 --> 01:02:15,965
No wonder, my shoulders feel heavy.

837
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:19,270
Ya, take everything,
take everything, take everything.

838
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,653
Why are you acting this way?

839
01:02:34,371 --> 01:02:36,796
Why are there couples everywhere?

840
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:39,222
The atmosphere is a little cold.

841
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:41,455
Why?

842
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:44,997
Are you in a bad mood because
other people might see us as a couple?

843
01:02:45,373 --> 01:02:49,130
Other people will just think
that Manager has a lot of money.

844
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:52,982
Where's Jae Hee? Has he gotten off work?

845
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:50,392
5.

846
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:52,224
4.

847
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:53,855
3.

848
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,229
2.

849
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:56,603
1.

850
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:20,779
<i>Oh, it started already!</i>

851
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:21,960
<i>Where, where.</i>

852
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:25,137
<i>I can't see it.</i>

853
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:28,585
<i>Ah, wait, where is it?</i>

854
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,785
<i>I really can't see it.
I've waited so long for it.</i>

855
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:08,212
Looks like we can't make it.
On all the nearby roads...

856
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:11,113
all the cars have just stopped to watch it.

857
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:14,154
We're better off just going back.

858
01:05:14,274 --> 01:05:17,911
We can only hear it and not see it,
it's really annoying.

859
01:05:18,031 --> 01:05:23,658
We shouldn't have driven,
we should have taken the subway, really.

860
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:25,461
<i>I'm sorry, because of us.</i>

861
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:27,586
<i>No, don't say that.</i>

862
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:30,550
As we're driving along, if there
are any roads we can take home.

863
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,951
We should just take them.

864
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:36,536
Should we?

865
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:55,429
Wow, really, it's really incredible.

866
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:59,357
This is my first time watching
a fireworks festival, it's really worth it.

<i>Are you going to stay
out here like a beggar?</i>

873
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:17,835
<i>You can't do this to me.</i>

874
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,927
<i>It's not like you're cooking
for anyone else.</i>

875
01:07:19,928 --> 01:07:21,328
<i>Why are your grocery bags so big.</i>

876
01:07:21,347 --> 01:07:22,858
<i>Jo Jae Hee sshi didn't come again today.</i>

877
01:07:22,978 --> 01:07:24,060
<i>Who is Jo Jae Hee sshi?</i>

878
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,836
<i>No matter who it is, I have to meet him.</i>

879
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:26,952
<i>Jo Jae Hee sshi!</i>

880
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:28,347
<i>They can't meet.</i>

881
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:30,065
<i>Even now, you're still borrowing.</i>

882
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:31,203
<i>Let me make a call.</i>

883
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:33,560
<i>Is this Jo Jae Hee sshi?</i>
