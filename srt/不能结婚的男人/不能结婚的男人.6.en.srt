Episode 6

4
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:21,474
It's water!

5
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:22,633
I know!

6
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:28,322
Please leave quickly!

7
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,705
I want to, too.

8
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,820
Give me a hairdryer, I'll leave when I'm dry.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,710
I don't have such a thing!

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,878
There's no hairdryer?

11
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,280
Compared to that chair, I'm even wetter.

12
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:04,192
If the water seeps in too deeply...

13
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:08,056
Lend me some wearable clothes and shoes.

14
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,130
What?

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,997
I want to leave this place.

16
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:13,336
I can't go out in this state!

17
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,927
It can't be seen clearly at night.

18
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,437
If I go out like this,
everyone will obviously stare at me!

19
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:30,071
You're the type who treats a chair more importantly
than a person, what more can I hope for?

20
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:32,953
Are you being impolite?

21
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,864
I'm talking to myself!

22
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:37,397
Is that the bathroom?

23
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:40,317
No. It's my house, how can you casually...

24
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you really going to chase me out like this?

25
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,521
No.

26
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,082
There's really nothing to pick
on the way he does household chores.

27
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,352
Thanks.

28
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,207
Bag!

29
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,438
I'm leaving.

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,294
This is too much!

31
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,097
I'm really speechless.

32
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,372
No wonder that until now
you still can't get married.

33
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,626
<i>Pot calling the kettle black!
Still laughing at others?</i>

34
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,467
Father, why are you here?

35
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,343
Did you just have dinner
with the fellow called Jo Jae Hee?

36
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,588
What?

37
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,560
It's a misunderstanding!

38
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:28,274
I don't need anything,
I'm okay so long as he's healthy!

39
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,714
What's there to be okay?!
I already said he's not!

40
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:34,306
He's just a patient.
What has Young Shil Unni been saying?

41
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:37,311
What can you cook?

42
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,759
If you're going to cook for him,
better do a good job.

43
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,034
Who am I going to cook for?

44
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,940
The last time, I saw you had a chicken
when you were going to his place.

45
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,052
It was to cook sam gye tang* at a friend's place.

46
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,052
{\a6}(*Ginseng chicken soup)

47
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:50,993
Since when do you have friends?
Aren't they all married?

48
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:54,377
But how do you explain those shoes?

49
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,739
This is...

50
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,526
This is a little complicated to explain.

51
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:02,556
Whatever it is...

52
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,111
Why are you hemming and hawing?

53
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,472
Don't tell me it's someone who can't be dated?

54
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:08,481
Huh?

55
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,391
Are you seeing a married man?

56
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,443
Father!

57
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:15,444
Then say honestly,
whose clothes are you wearing?

58
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,772
It's Mr. Jo Jae Hee's clothes.

59
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:20,317
Although they're his...

60
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,099
What have you done?

61
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:25,239
Women should become a little more mature
as they age. What are you thinking of?!

62
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:29,640
I already said it's not! Father, really!

63
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,246
It's not like that.

64
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,543
I went to Mr. Jo Jae Hee's place
for a house call.

65
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,582
Is he so old he can't go out?

66
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,885
He was admitted to hospital due to exhaustion,

67
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,859
in the end he sneaked out
of the hospital to work.

68
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,028
What's his occupation?

69
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,625
I don't want a man who
relies on you to support him.

70
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,150
Stop imagining things yourself!

71
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,845
Just let me finish talking. Please!

72
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,271
What exactly is that fellow's job?

73
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,403
Father, has your blood pressure gone up again?!
Are you okay, Father?

74
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:00,851
- What does he do?
- Dizzy?

75
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,310
How old?

76
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,543
Forty, architect.

77
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,818
Father, are you okay? Dizzy?

78
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:09,759
Write down his telephone number.
I want to meet him.

79
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,537
Father, why do you want to meet him?!

80
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,785
You went to buy groceries just to cook for him!

81
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:19,241
You came out of his place looking like this,
so I have ample reason to see him.

82
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:22,976
I'm really going mad. I already said it's not!

83
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,497
Didn't you say you even went
to see fireworks together?

84
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,730
That was...

85
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,426
I understand.

86
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,410
From the internet, I should be able
to find out the Society of Architects.

87
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,685
Father, don't call Mr. Jo Jae Hee.

88
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:37,109
Surely you won't let your daughter
lose face, right?

89
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,685
Father, it's just a patient. It's business.

90
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:43,398
If you treat my patient that way,
I will lose face in front of my colleagues.

91
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:46,230
Father, that is something
that shouldn't be done, right?

92
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,375
I understand.

93
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,810
Father, don't say anything.

94
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,935
I won't do anything, I know!

95
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,189
- Father, really? I'll believe then!
- Yes, I get it!

96
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:56,793
- I'll believe you then!
- Yup!

97
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,081
I believe you!

98
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:17,996
My father has left something behind again.

99
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:31,656
What smell is this? Smells good.

100
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,876
Why is it so hot?

101
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,782
<i>Architect Jo Jae Hee.</i>

102
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,225
He makes a pretty decent living.

103
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:16,594
<i>Jo Jae Hee Architect Office</i>

104
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,047
How handsome!

105
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:56,998
[Episode 6]
[Family pressure faced by single men and women]

106
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,874
Hello.

107
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,185
What's wrong with Ahjussi?

108
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,571
Suit and tie.

109
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,276
When will that wall be blocked?

110
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,505
If you want to block it, do it yourself.

111
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,832
I'm totally not bothered by it.

112
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:30,911
You are hoping to leave
your footprints at my place?

113
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:35,917
But where are you going,
all dressed neatly like this?

114
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:41,971
A scary place.

115
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,868
What a great figure!

116
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,852
Ahjussi, you're going matchmaking, right?

117
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:01,847
Jae Hee! How long are we going
to do all these for?

118
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,417
Ever since I have a daughter-in-law,

119
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,866
my hands have not touched
a single drop of water.

120
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:12,464
I'm already so old and at my in-law's place,
but what's all this?

121
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:19,527
Hyungnim, you are so... Doesn't the fellow
in my family really like the pancakes you make?

122
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,521
Want me to matchmake?

123
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,848
<i>In our neighborhood, there is a...
How would you say that?</i>

124
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,532
Just like how you people call it... a "re-single".

125
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:33,914
She is a fairly good catch, and has no children.

126
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,374
Re-single?

127
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,005
Returning single.

128
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,229
A divorcée.

129
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:40,536
We don't need you to spell it out!

130
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:44,507
Our eldest grandson behaves like this,

131
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:49,401
I wonder why our sister-in-law
is still feeling so at peace?

132
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,734
Why would Mom be at peace?

133
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,053
Honestly speaking, at Jae Hee's age,

134
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:59,045
it's not easy to meet
a divorced woman without kids.

135
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,644
<i>Compared to a virgin who is of a similar age,</i>

136
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,705
and to spare a thought for our next generation,

137
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,324
a young divorcée would be more ideal.

138
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,615
<i>The males in our family are rare commodities.</i>

139
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,448
<i>Besides, you can't guarantee
that the firstborn would be a boy.</i>

140
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,774
<i>You at least have to give birth to two!</i>

141
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:19,466
Hyungnim, I'll get you some ingredients.

142
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:28,586
Jae Hee, you do know that before your brother
passed away, he was most worried about you?

143
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,003
Yes.

144
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:49,346
Why do you keep calling?
I'm still in the conference.

145
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:52,587
Come over quickly to chat with the elders.

146
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:54,970
Isn't that what you do best?

147
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,166
Are you being nagged at by the aunties?

148
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,076
What's going to happen to you?

149
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,888
I'm afraid it'll take another two hours to end.

150
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,282
Follow exactly what I've said.

151
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:19,425
Dad, what kind of place is Crazy Horse?

152
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:27,057
Ye Won, Dad is coming back immediately!

153
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:33,194
He's coming back immediately.

154
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:40,471
Why is Uncle unable to get married?

155
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,663
What?

156
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:47,665
Everyone else is married,
only Uncle is alone. How pitiful!

157
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,690
Aren't you alone, too?

158
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:15,547
Matchmaking?

159
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,549
He wore a suit and even a tie,
so it felt like that.

160
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,181
Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

161
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:26,493
I asked him if he was going matchmaking.
He said he didn't feel like answering.

162
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:29,734
But my instinct tells me it is.

163
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:32,675
Mr. Jo Jae Hee goes matchmaking?

164
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,266
Didn't he say he doesn't want to get married?

165
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:38,670
Didn't he vow celibacy?

166
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:53,572
Nowadays, a healthy man like him,
still can't even find a partner.

167
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:59,694
Divorced women are not too bad, too.
Why are you like this?

168
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:03,386
<i>It seems he's exactly like Oppa.</i>

169
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:12,061
What's the occasion
that calls for wearing a suit?

170
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:15,097
Looks like you went to a nice place.

171
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:21,949
At our age, the place we're being dragged to
when we wear a suit, would it be a good place?

172
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,602
That's true.

173
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,773
Funeral procession. Wedding ceremony.

174
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:30,444
If not, a dull matchmaking session?

175
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,038
It's my father's death anniversary today.

176
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:37,615
I came back from the remembrance ceremony.

177
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,268
Ahh.

178
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,034
Is your stomach okay?

179
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,054
If I were at a relative's place,

180
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:49,661
I would suffer from severe indigestion
due to their intense bombardment.

181
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:54,748
A forty-year old who is not married,
it's natural to have the family worried.

182
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,303
It's my neglect.

183
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:03,906
For a moment,
I thought we were on the same side.

184
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:09,701
Even if it's the same age,
there's still a difference between man and woman.

185
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,905
Make good use of the alcohol
to drown your sorrows.

186
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:20,354
DVD, two, four, six.

187
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,832
Have a great weekend.

188
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:24,770
Bye.

189
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,552
Are you going to leave like this?

190
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:27,862
What?

191
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,609
What's the reason for calling me?

192
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,196
The clothes and shoes,

193
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:38,170
I've left them at Yu Jin's.

194
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,854
I called you to tell you this.

195
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,700
I'm leaving.

196
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:56,326
<i>Thanks for your clothes, they've been washed.
Jang Mun Jung.</i>

197
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,861
It's worse than I thought.

198
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:24,414
A case like numbed limbs shouldn't be neglected.
A checkup should be done.

199
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:27,035
How is Father's schedule today?

200
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,740
A patient made an appointment at four o'clock.

201
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,422
Is there only one person
who made an appointment today?

202
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,651
It's like that recently.

203
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:39,398
Sometimes, he only sees two people a day.

204
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:43,628
I've already fixed the appointment.
Let him come before five-thirty.

205
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,152
Okay.

206
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,433
What are you talking about?

207
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,695
I hope to have two exits on the second floor.

208
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:58,237
We are living under one roof,
why would we require two hallways?

209
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,513
There's no such thing!

210
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:02,803
Whose idea is this?

211
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:05,679
What do you mean, whose idea?
It's mine, of course.

212
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,209
Even though we're staying together,
it's also good to have individual privacy, Mom.

213
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:14,129
Every time he comes home late,
he would be disturbing Father and Mother.

214
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,190
It's not very convenient.

215
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,067
You're the one who comes
home late more often, aren't you?

216
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,124
Exits will be built on both levels one and two.

217
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:29,052
There are also other ways
to keep the internal interaction.

218
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,508
Then that's settled.

219
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,857
I'm already very grateful
that you're living with us.

220
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,997
Where is it?

221
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:45,112
Mun Jung wants you to go
to the hospital before five-thirty.

222
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,108
What are you looking for?

223
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:48,547
It's here.

224
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,148
Jo Jae Hee...

225
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,433
Isn't Jo Jae Hee
Mun Jung's patient who feigned illness?

226
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:57,953
Why are you calling?

227
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,895
I want to see what type of fellow he is.

228
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,762
Didn't I say there's nothing between them?

229
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:04,575
I was reprimanded by Mun Jung!

230
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,215
I have my own views.

231
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:08,739
Let go!

232
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,138
They left in two cars.

233
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:17,324
The parents have a medium-sized car,
their son has a small car.

234
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:18,741
What's this?

235
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,095
Why only say it now when the design
has already been done.

236
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,916
The son wanted to stay with them all of a sudden,
what can we do?

237
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:26,783
I heard there're more
of such families these days.

238
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:31,812
They once stayed apart, but moved back to live
with the parents again because of hardship.

239
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:34,131
Is this the relationship
between mother and daughter-in-law?

240
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,127
My parents are already a fuss.

241
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,295
Other people's parents,
who have no blood ties with me...

242
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,828
don't even talk about it.

243
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,023
Why can't it be done?

244
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:45,826
Regardless of how the heart feels,

245
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:49,196
pretending to be a filial son and daughter-in-law,
can be a flawless act.

246
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,152
It's best you two continue to be single.

247
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:54,900
Your attitudes have already
been steered towards that path.

248
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,219
I have confidence!

249
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:03,186
Mother, what would you like to eat tonight?

250
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:08,552
It feels as if the mother's dinner
would be poisoned.

251
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:17,354
Jo Jae Hee Architecture Office.

252
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:20,381
I'll design a partition for the bedroom.

253
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:23,201
Let them beat the hell out of each other
when they quarrel.

254
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,155
Yes, please hold on.

255
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,022
Jo Jae Hee, call.

256
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,242
Yes?

257
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,324
Is this Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

258
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,462
Yes.

259
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:42,431
This is Jang Bong Soo Dentistry
located in Sae Euni-dong.

260
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:43,697
What?

261
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:47,079
Over here,
the hospital and dentistry are together.

262
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:52,480
But we wish to separate the two.
The hospital wants a revamp of the interior.

263
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,992
We don't do interior renovation.

264
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,692
Hello! Hello!

265
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,418
Why did you pass me a prank call?

266
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:04,104
He was looking for Jo Jae Hee.

267
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:09,814
What's wrong with my stomach again...

268
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,658
It's painful again?

269
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,384
Yup, it's strange.

270
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,151
What a rude fellow!

271
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:28,837
You lied about renovation,
just to see what sort of person he is?

272
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:32,454
President really made an effort!

273
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,848
Nurse Jo.

274
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,287
Yes?

275
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:42,580
Well...

276
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:50,567
I've decided to give up this seat to Manager Yoo.

277
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:52,220
What?

278
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,894
After giving up this seat,

279
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,362
I'll leave the hospital.

280
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,033
Are you retiring?

281
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,060
My energy level can't keep up,
so I can't continue with the job anymore.

282
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:09,905
Whatever it is, I still wish to hang on
till Mun Jung gets married.

283
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,459
If a dentist's hand shakes
during a tooth extraction,

284
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:16,563
it's time for retirement.

285
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:22,101
When there are fewer patients,
the job becomes pointless as well.

286
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:27,554
President, how can you behave like this?

287
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:32,449
I've already given you some good job referrals.

288
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:35,221
You think I'll be worried
about having no place to go?

289
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:39,265
I've been working with
the President for thirty years.

290
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,571
Like you, I've worked here for thirty years!

291
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:44,890
How can you not even breathe a word,

292
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,530
and just take action on your own?!

293
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,249
Really, I hate such things!

294
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,160
Don't cry!

295
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:01,882
I just want to settle everything quietly
without telling Mun Jung.

296
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:07,721
You're not even telling Mun Jung?

297
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:11,853
I don't want to drag Mun Jung in to cry together.

298
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:16,232
She would definitely reminisce
about her mother and be teary.

299
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:19,345
I'm scared I'll change my mind.

300
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:23,127
I should settle things
when I've already set my mind to it.

301
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:26,154
Such impatience, how can anyone stand it?

302
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,018
What time did Mun Jung want me over?

303
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:31,714
Five-thirty!

304
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,566
Please come in.

305
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,591
Please sit.

306
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:06,767
This T-shirt can't be ironed.

307
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:12,456
If it's not ironed well,
it would become too smooth.

308
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,415
Smooth? Where?

309
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:32,392
Shall I buy you the exact same shirt?
Do you want a compensation?

310
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,830
No.

311
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:38,153
Even if it's smooth,
I'll still be able to grasp it.

312
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:41,695
It's so great to have many talents.

313
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,087
This is not a talent, it's general knowledge.

314
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:49,734
Where are you not feeling well today?

315
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,551
My stomach hurts tremendously.

316
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,300
I'll press this area for a while.

317
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,631
That hurts as well.

318
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,799
Up there as well.

319
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:22,740
Up here? Does it hurt as well?

320
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:38,326
Your stomach is really a bit bloated today.

321
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:41,052
This happens when you are under stress.

322
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:44,830
You look fine on the surface,

323
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,516
but you were under some stress
at your relative's place right?

324
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:51,551
There are some stresses in life you can't avoid.

325
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:54,960
To be able to endure stress
is such a fortunate thing.

326
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,965
That proves that you're a normal person.

327
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,959
Your father will be here
before five-thirty right?

328
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,449
- Are you wrapping up?
- Yes.

329
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,227
Mr. Jo Jae Hee!

330
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,168
The two of them cannot meet!

331
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:46,305
What?

332
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,740
Oh my God! What should I do?
It's a major disaster!

333
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,273
Hello.

334
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:37,735
Father, have you reached the hospital? Where?

335
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,799
<i>I can't go today.</i>

336
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,808
What?

337
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,513
<i>A patient is late for an appointment,
I'm still waiting.</i>

338
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:48,150
Really? Say so earlier.

339
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,453
Okay, I know, but you must come tomorrow.
You have to have the checkup.

340
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:53,784
<i>I know.</i>

341
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,065
Thank God!

342
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:08,424
To Pan Gyeol Apartments.

343
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:11,303
<i>Hold on, hold on! Let's take it together.</i>

344
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,956
What are you doing, Ahjussi?

345
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,372
Grandfather, what's wrong with you?

346
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,185
- We know each other.
- I don't know him!

347
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,353
Are you Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

348
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:22,175
I'm Mun Jung's father.

349
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:25,760
Mun Jung? Are you referring to Doctor Jang?

350
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,897
Yes.

351
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,173
So?

352
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,976
Let's have a chat.

353
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:33,509
What's there to talk about?

354
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,419
Go to Sae Euni-dong.

355
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,342
Old man!

356
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:38,339
<i>What should we do?</i>

357
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:41,065
There's nothing to talk about
between the two of us.

358
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,704
Then just listen to me.

359
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,743
I'm not a person with so much free time.

360
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:50,156
Aren't you going home
since you're going to Pan Gyeol Apartments?

361
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,491
The door can't be opened from that side.

362
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,411
Alright, let's set off then!

363
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:07,528
Let's set off!

364
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:10,021
Move in a bit.

365
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,543
Are both your parents still alive?

366
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,861
What exactly do you want to know?

367
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:26,893
Your character's not too good.

368
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:37,598
<i>Korea Architecture Grand Award.
Seoul Special Architecture Grand Award.</i>

369
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:40,773
Wow, are all these Ahjussi's awards?

370
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,469
How cool!

371
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,238
It doesn't feel like the ahjussi I know.

372
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:49,419
Hey, must you say such things in front of me?

373
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,193
You're also cool.

374
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:54,756
The passion of young people can be felt.

375
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:59,200
But I can't feel that your heart is true.

376
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,097
Park Hyun Kyu.

377
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:03,729
What?

378
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:05,360
Who knows!

379
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,559
You might become such a person
when you reach forty.

380
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,641
Of course!

381
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:15,342
I'm definitely way stronger than Director Jo.

382
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:18,712
I really envy you.

383
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:21,074
You're doing something that you really wanted.

384
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,371
I've been with securities firms,
home shopping and food companies.

385
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,754
It's been two years since
I've bummed around as an intern.

386
00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:30,587
But I still don't know what I want to do.

387
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,215
Yu Jin.

388
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:39,753
This is what we call youth.

389
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:44,093
According to our future plans...

390
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:48,022
Hey! You're always finding ways
to get close to me.

391
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,423
Yes, Doctor?

392
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:00,194
Looks like you don't smoke.

393
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:03,886
And don't grind your teeth.

394
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:06,812
How did you meet?

395
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:13,100
That shows you have really good food habits.

396
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,599
Why are you doing this?

397
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,518
These teeth are naturally perfect.

398
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:22,742
Are your parents still around?

399
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:30,470
There's a decayed tooth, let's treat it.

400
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,552
I don't want to!

401
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:35,841
What are you doing?

402
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,315
Don't worry, it's not painful.

403
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,833
Should I prepare the mold?

404
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,786
Rinse your mouth.

405
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:56,186
- Why are you doing this?
- Let's continue with it.

406
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,098
Don't make a sound.

407
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,769
It's done.

408
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,980
Rinse your mouth again.

409
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,279
Lie down.

410
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,245
Then...

411
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,456
Bite it.

412
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:20,740
Bite for ten minutes.

413
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:26,059
He's so handsome.

414
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,592
He is handsome.

415
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,018
I thought at forty if you're still single,

416
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:34,975
you're either very ugly, or require
some height booster to forcibly reach 1.6 meters.

417
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,859
I thought there would be some sort of problem.

418
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:40,122
<i>My God! He's perfectly normal!</i>

419
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,703
We've not gone into the topic yet,
where are you going?

420
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:47,193
I've been dragged here for no reason,
so let's end it here.

421
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:51,795
What do you mean dragged? I checked your teeth,
even gave you free treatment.

422
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,276
What's your relationship with Mun Jung?

423
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:57,161
I'm the patient, Doctor Jang is my doctor.
That's our relationship!

424
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:58,872
<i>My daughter said the same as well.</i>

425
00:32:58,992 --> 00:33:01,346
I saw my daughter
wearing your clothes and shoes home.

426
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:02,607
How do you explain that?

427
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,303
Just ask your daughter.

428
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:08,375
You trust and rely on each other,
there's obviously something going on here!

429
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,101
How long are you going to follow me?

430
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:14,214
Just try strolling around with an old man.

431
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,871
I'll accompany you till the end.

432
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:24,778
Just carry on walking, I'll keep up very soon.

433
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:31,066
Then, just ask three questions.

434
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:32,805
I'll keep you company till there.

435
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,350
I don't want anything!

436
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,080
I just need a favor from you.

437
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:42,741
What is it?

438
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:44,738
You need to receive
your last treatment on Friday.

439
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,001
You'll be the last patient,
so I'll take special care.

440
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,770
What?

441
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:55,900
The forty-two years of the life of a dentist.

442
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:01,994
I'll regard treating your decayed tooth
as a closure,

443
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,484
and will then retire.

444
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:16,007
Got it! See you on Friday then.

445
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:20,494
Where are you going?
You haven't heard my request!

446
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,576
Wasn't that your request?

447
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:29,779
Have a drink with me, this is my request.

448
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,033
No.

449
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:37,553
Hey, how can you leave?

450
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,872
<i>You must satisfy me!</i>

451
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,405
<i>This is my last request! Hey!</i>

452
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,571
I wish to get married before thirty.

453
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,427
Before thirty?

454
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:56,593
I wanted to as well,
and thought it would happen.

455
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,982
Thirty, the prime of youth!

456
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,628
Hold on!

457
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:09,792
But why am I the only one who finds
massage and facial hair removal painful?

458
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:13,270
Is this also connected to age?

459
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,259
<i>At that time, when Mun Jung was eight...</i>

460
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:20,123
<i>When you see that an elder's wine glass is empty,</i>

461
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,076
<i>you should take some initiative!</i>

462
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,808
Where did my father's voice come from?

463
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:31,341
What? Father?

464
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,132
<i>Do you know who was my first patient?</i>

465
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:35,869
<i>It's Mun Jung, right?</i>

466
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,930
Someone just said Mun Jung, right?

467
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,620
Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

468
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,929
Where?

469
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,591
<i>It's Ahjussi.</i>

470
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,880
Father?

471
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:08,990
The business started in February 1977.

472
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:12,768
At that time, my feeling was really...

473
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,256
You've also set up a company,
so you would understand that feeling right?

474
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:23,236
Holding tightly the hands of Mun Jung and her mom,

475
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:26,864
and watching the signboard ascending slowly,

476
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,994
I was feeling both moved and scared.

477
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:34,471
How touching that was!

478
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:49,207
The business was built with my own bare hands.

479
00:36:56,607 --> 00:37:01,480
However, Mun Jung's mom was in an operation
due to a sudden heart attack.

480
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:11,216
Can you eat that later?

481
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,179
<i>What are you two doing here?</i>

482
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:24,312
What are you doing, Father?

483
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:26,287
<i>Nothing, you...</i>

484
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,292
Why are you using this to cover?

485
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:33,006
What's wrong with your face?

486
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,067
It'll be okay very soon.

487
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:38,338
What's wrong with the two of you?

488
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,098
Ahjussi.

489
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,622
Hello.

490
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,263
How did you two know each other?

491
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:47,036
When did it start? What are you doing?

492
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:49,827
This old man is really stubborn.

493
00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:52,360
Father, you finally still rang Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

494
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,850
Didn't I ask you not to call?

495
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:59,986
Student, why are you sitting there?

496
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:02,970
I'm not a student.

497
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,255
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, I'm sorry. My father...

498
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,933
What's there to be sorry about. I didn't
do anything. We only met each other by chance.

499
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,058
You didn't do anything?

500
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:14,699
You were following me like a hound the whole day.

501
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,011
You'd only let me go after I drink with you,
so we came here.

502
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:20,467
For someone who's been dragged here,
you certainly enjoyed eating the ramen.

503
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:24,396
That's because I'm hungry.

504
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,674
Father, please explain.

505
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:31,848
I just wanted to see what sort
of person Mr. Jo is. Can't I do that?

506
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:34,896
What exactly did Doctor Jang say?

507
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,776
I had to go through your father's family survey.

508
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,966
Let's get things straight.

509
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:43,186
Did you have to directly answer
any family survey questions?

510
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:49,548
I've asked many times, but you still did not say
whether your parents are still around.

511
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:53,777
This ahjussi has never been easy
to communicate with.

512
00:38:56,971 --> 00:39:01,200
In order to let my only daughter get married,
I had to curb my temper.

513
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,055
Which is to say, the situation now...

514
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,900
Doctor's father has regarded Ahjussi
as a son-in-law.

515
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,253
But why?

516
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:13,838
I don't care if you're a student or not,
but what is your identity?

517
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:15,630
Identity?

518
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,764
What's wrong with Yu Jin?
She's my friend.

519
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:23,057
You're such an idiot.

520
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:25,567
Is that girl, who is your niece's rank,
your friend?

521
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,606
Is this America?

522
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:32,500
So, you introduced a niece-like friend to Mr. Jo,

523
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,273
and the two of them know each other?

524
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:39,742
We are neighbors to begin with,
next door to each other.

525
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:42,962
Whatever it is, just don't hang out with her.

526
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:48,450
How old am I? This is really embarrassing!

527
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,897
Why do you detest me?

528
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:55,169
Before it becomes even more embarrassing,
just find a suitable person to get married!

529
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:59,080
It's none of my concern,
so don't drag me into it.

530
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,205
I'm exhausted! What's the meaning of this?!

531
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:03,610
I'm sorry you're tired!

532
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,164
Isn't your mother the same as well?

533
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,560
Did you think I didn't receive any family survey?

534
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,535
Didn't I say not to see my mother anymore?

535
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:12,210
This is exactly what I'm going to say.

536
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,099
Let me meet your mother.

537
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,752
- Father!
- Old man!

538
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,469
Excuse me...

539
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:21,073
What's important is how these two feel?

540
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:23,027
Do you two intend to get married?

541
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:24,164
No!

542
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:27,022
Do you think I've spent precious years away,

543
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:30,114
just so I could meet such a man in the end?

544
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:33,312
I'm not getting married.
I have vowed celibacy.

545
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:36,310
What's this? Celibacy?

546
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,444
This man has vowed celibacy.
It's the type that Father detests most.

547
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:42,256
An abhorrent, reactionary, anti-social egoist.

548
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:45,176
You should have said so earlier!

549
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,782
You didn't ask.

550
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:51,324
He's just such a person.

551
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:53,192
Can we go now?

552
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:55,682
Father, are you clear now?

553
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:59,146
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, I'm really sorry for today.

554
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,142
Whatever you've heard from my father today,

555
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,212
just pretend you didn't hear. Please forget it.

556
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:07,067
Then the last treatment...

557
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:08,613
Mr. Jo!

558
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,434
You must keep the secret from Mun Jung,
understand?

559
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,556
What topic?

560
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,421
What secret?

561
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:22,049
What secret?

562
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,557
See you on Friday then!

563
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:32,717
I'm leaving.

564
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,747
Travel safe.

565
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,851
- See you.
- Ahjussi!

566
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:39,872
Let's go.

567
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:42,127
How can there be such a person?

568
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:47,601
That's true! He's not normal when he's forty
and still not married.

569
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:50,972
Keep a distance from me.

570
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:51,984
What?

571
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:55,569
I've been followed the whole day,
so I'm a little tired.

572
00:41:55,689 --> 00:42:00,098
There better not be anyone's breathing sound
within 1 meter from me.

573
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,571
Keep a distance from me.

574
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:04,469
Can you even hear the sound of breathing?

575
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,658
You must be slow to not feel it.

576
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:10,522
I'm sensitive so it's very strenuous.

577
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:14,713
Then Ahjussi should stay away from me!

578
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:34,514
Ahjussi!

579
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:39,816
It's because you've not interacted with people
for a long time, your immunity level has dropped.

580
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:43,165
You should hang with people more often.

581
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:50,277
You're here.

582
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:54,334
You're here alone again.

583
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:04,978
Someone you know?

584
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:12,547
Is this your girlfriend?

585
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,114
<i>No!</i>

586
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:22,492
No?

587
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,016
Yup!

588
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,769
We'll see each other the next time then.

589
00:43:56,555 --> 00:44:01,774
Mr. Jo, you must keep that secret from Mun Jung.

590
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:03,599
Secret?

591
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:15,681
The rumors are spreading like wildfire, huh?

592
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:36,452
What's this?

593
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:58,314
Director, what are you doing?

594
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,238
Director!

595
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:18,550
This should be done this way!

596
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:24,797
Being this close to the director
is really a first.

597
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:27,017
How lucky!

598
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:30,495
This proves you are also a healthy normal man.

599
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:32,599
I already said it's a mistake!

600
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,530
I will definitely help Director
to keep this secret.

601
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:39,750
It doesn't matter if you say it,
it's a mistake anyway.

602
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,167
Yes, yes. I started with a mistake as well.

603
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:46,108
We all say that at the beginning.

604
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,101
To commemorate us sharing the same sentiment,
give me a high five!

605
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:07,398
Since when did they become so close?

606
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:11,177
Whatever it is, to do such things
early in the morning, it's really a little...

607
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:14,141
I'm too shy, that's why I really can't do it.

608
00:46:14,261 --> 00:46:16,911
End it quickly, I still need to look at drafts.

609
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:19,965
<i>What are you doing?</i>

610
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:25,031
Director, it's been hard on you.

611
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:27,350
It's tougher on you.

612
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,455
We're having a meeting. Go do your work.

613
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:32,236
You're here?

614
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,355
<i>Jae Hee, Shin Chul's meeting
has been pushed to five o'clock.</i>

615
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:43,986
<i>Is that okay?</i>

616
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:47,614
No, I already have an appointment at five.

617
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:55,308
I will let them take down the signboard tomorrow.

618
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:56,853
Well done.

619
00:46:58,098 --> 00:47:00,463
Kim Soon Dentistry wants to hire you,
you're really not going?

620
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,502
Even the remuneration has been settled.

621
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:04,177
I'm not going.

622
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:06,323
I want to do my own business.

623
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:08,277
What business?

624
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:17,590
Please use three words to describe
your feelings as my last patient.

625
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:23,688
It's okay.

626
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:26,951
Come, let's start.

627
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:50,442
Damn it!

628
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:03,400
Why don't you hurry up and block it up?

629
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,945
It's a transaction.

630
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,748
What transaction.

631
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:10,076
Doctor Jang says she will block up this wall.

632
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:17,813
But, there's one condition.

633
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:20,211
How can you state any condition
when you were the ones who pried it open?

634
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:21,499
Isn't it ridiculous?

635
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:23,431
Just listen to the condition first.

636
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:25,793
Who knows, you might be interested.

637
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:31,606
What's the condition?

638
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:34,912
The secret between
Doctor Jang's father and Ahjussi.

639
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:36,414
<i>What's that?</i>

640
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:39,166
<i>Mr. Jo, you must keep the secret from Mun Jung.</i>

641
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,948
<i>That was what was said.</i>

642
00:49:41,463 --> 00:49:45,155
Tell us the secret
and we will block up this wall.

643
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:46,873
Tomorrow, immediately!

644
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,825
We have a plan, too.

645
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:55,551
Be my guest.

646
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,845
I heard Sanggu really likes
to go over to your place.

647
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:01,185
I'm really going mad.

648
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:04,877
My God! Why do you detest such a cute dog?

649
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:09,557
What I hate most is dogs that wear clothes.

650
00:50:10,629 --> 00:50:11,960
That's right!

651
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,931
Sanggu's nappies can go
into your washing machine as well.

652
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,756
Okay, I shall place all the washed bottles
at the balcony.

653
00:50:25,518 --> 00:50:26,942
Let this dog's legs...

654
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,523
<i>Stop!</i>

655
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:31,228
Doctor, can't let Sanggu do it.

656
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:34,951
Can't you tell me what it is?

657
00:50:35,071 --> 00:50:37,570
You will know in a week's time.

658
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:40,855
How petty!

659
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:44,804
Sanggu, let's go.

660
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:53,649
Forget it, they've only known
each other for one day,

661
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:55,624
what secret can there be?

662
00:50:55,744 --> 00:50:58,951
But in order to spite me, he's gotten more cocky.

663
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:00,199
But...

664
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:06,446
Don't you think there's a similarity
between Doctor's father and that ahjussi?

665
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,399
How similar?

666
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,155
My father leads a normal path.
That guy is unorthodox.

667
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,593
The two of them can't even
communicate with each other,

668
00:51:15,713 --> 00:51:18,641
but they share a common trait,
that is making me angry.

669
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,536
<i>Doctor, perhaps you have the ability
to attract strange people.</i>

670
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:28,007
<i>But where would the 70th
birthday celebration be held?</i>

671
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,067
<i>I thought about it before I came over.</i>

672
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,461
<i>I want to hold it at father's hospital.
What do you think?</i>

673
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:37,879
<i>Father is someone who meant his words.</i>

674
00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:14,312
Please sit.

675
00:52:24,382 --> 00:52:26,550
What is it today?

676
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:31,509
Jang Bong Soo Dentistry has closed.

677
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:35,176
Bye.

678
00:52:36,722 --> 00:52:39,620
Hold on, say it one more time.

679
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,003
Which place has closed?

680
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,376
What do you mean closed?

681
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:54,807
How could you only say it now.

682
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,426
Secret? What a joke!

683
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:01,698
Why? What right have you?

684
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:06,006
He's afraid you would be behaving
exactly like this, all teary,

685
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:07,552
and he would feel vexed.

686
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:10,020
Of course it's vexing.

687
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:14,815
I'm speechless! What's wrong with being teary?

688
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,516
Why do you know about
my father's retirement and I don't?

689
00:53:19,636 --> 00:53:24,132
Even if it's my father,
I shouldn't be treated like this.

690
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:30,661
Let's switch grounds and ponder for a moment.
If it was you, what would you do?

691
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:39,738
Father has put down his lifetime of work,
the amount of memories there are!

692
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:44,707
I even wanted to go help out
at the hospital this autumn.

693
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:57,443
When the hospital was opened,
Mom, me and Father...

694
00:53:57,563 --> 00:53:59,301
I've already heard all about it at the sauna.

695
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:00,782
Hear it again!

696
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,468
How could you only say it now?

697
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:07,731
Why do you have to repeat what you already said?

698
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:09,921
If the hospital's signboard
has already been taken down,

699
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,744
I won't let you get away.

700
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:15,320
Why do you all treat me...

701
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,997
Do you know if there's
a good soondae* shop around?

702
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,997
{\a6}(*Korean sausage made with pig's intestines
and other ingredients)

703
00:54:23,713 --> 00:54:27,556
Don't make an estimated guess.
It has to be really delicious, the best shop.

704
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,978
Ah! I know a good place for gop chang*.

705
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,978
{\a6}(*Cow intestines)

706
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:36,468
What should I expect?

707
00:54:38,744 --> 00:54:40,185
What about soondae soup?

708
00:54:40,305 --> 00:54:45,852
When Father retires, I really want to treat him
to some really delicious soondae soup.

709
00:54:45,972 --> 00:54:48,707
Why does it have to be soondae soup?

710
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:53,310
When he was young, he really liked soondae soup.

711
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,573
But when he became a dentist,
he stopped eating it.

712
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,314
<i>You have to be in close facial contact
when treating patients.</i>

713
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:02,863
But if you eat food that contains too much spring
onion, patients would have an unpleasant time.

714
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:04,982
So he has to be choosy in his food.

715
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,923
My father has not been able to eat
his favorite food.

716
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:11,601
<i>Can I stop right in front?</i>

717
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:13,149
Yes.

718
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:36,040
When this signboard was being put up,

719
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,046
compared to Mom, who was with you then,

720
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,358
I'm now even much older than she had been.

721
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:47,510
It's been tough on you, Father.

722
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:56,060
Just get married, Mun Jung.

723
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,847
At least I still have you.

724
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:06,939
The next time, when it's your turn to retire,

725
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:12,054
who would be holding your hand?

726
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,023
Dad!

727
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:43,731
The water has gotten into my pants!

728
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:46,479
- It's cooler this way!
- There's a call. The phone.

729
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:47,724
Here, water.

730
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:49,334
Hand.

731
00:56:55,698 --> 00:56:56,965
What?

732
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:02,976
Do you know where's the best soondae shop?

733
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:07,699
How do you know I'm a soondae soup lover?

734
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:13,581
It's because Foreman's body
always has a soondae smell.

735
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,391
You son of a bitch!

736
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:25,462
[In front of the University hospital
at Guro Market, Butcher's Soondae]

737
00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:36,066
Ahjussi, change of direction.
Please go to Guro Market.

738
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,054
<i>Okay.</i>

739
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:52,967
That's okay, I'll do it myself.

740
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,981
Is it delicious?

741
00:58:18,226 --> 00:58:21,575
The first meal after embarking
on a new life journey.

742
00:58:23,142 --> 00:58:28,822
From now on,
just indulge in eating spring onions and garlic.

743
00:58:34,918 --> 00:58:38,152
What are your future plans, Mr. Jang Bong Soo?

744
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:40,578
It's to let you get married.

745
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:44,077
Just let me enjoy eating as well!

746
00:58:45,552 --> 00:58:48,708
Why did that fellow just leave without a trace?

747
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:52,998
He must have felt mushy
after seeing us hold hands.

748
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:57,420
Why did he vow celibacy?

749
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:04,982
Father, what about the thirty-two years
after Mom passed away,

750
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:08,438
why didn't you have a relationship or get married?

751
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:10,391
Is it because of me?

752
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:13,125
I did have, how could I not have?

753
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:15,515
What?

754
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:19,229
Do you think I'm as silly as you?

755
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:23,751
Really?

756
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,781
Of course.

757
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:27,186
It's impossible! Who's that?

758
00:59:27,486 --> 00:59:29,075
Who is it? When was it?

759
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:30,814
Not telling you.

760
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:32,964
You're lying, right?

761
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:35,454
We'll just wait and see.

762
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:36,764
Father!

763
01:00:14,703 --> 01:00:16,699
Green represents parents' space.

764
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:19,877
Yellow represents son's space.

765
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,462
<i>Then where's this?</i>

766
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,063
Living room and kitchen are communal space.

767
01:00:26,183 --> 01:00:27,265
What?

768
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:33,641
No, we actually intend to design
a separate living room and kitchen.

769
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:35,541
Right, that...

770
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:39,942
However, we feel that a so-called home,

771
01:00:40,062 --> 01:00:46,053
requires a communal space that allows gatherings,
conversations, and even quarrels as well.

772
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,278
I'm okay with it.

773
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:57,063
You will definitely be pleased
with our Director's design.

774
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:59,510
There's no other way to it.

775
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,786
The budget is too low.

776
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:14,438
<i>The soondae soup was really delicious.</i>

777
01:01:14,558 --> 01:01:17,316
<i>Let's go together the next time. I...</i>

778
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:37,795
<i>Mr. Jo Jae Hee, thank you.</i>

779
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,872
Professor Parnar's Imagination.
Who borrowed it? It has still not been returned.

780
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:02,104
Please hold on.

781
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:08,741
It's been renewed.

782
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,875
Call and ask.

783
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:13,141
Call?

784
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:24,578
This is the video shop
that's full of warmth and sincerity. Yes.

785
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:30,487
Professor Parnar's Imagination
has still not been returned.

786
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:35,382
I'm afraid it can't be done today.

787
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:43,800
In that case, can we go over to collect it today?

788
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:45,689
Okay.

789
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:48,437
That's a simple problem.

790
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,776
However, she said she's only free now.

791
01:03:05,196 --> 01:03:08,072
Where's the place, I'll go and get it.

792
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:17,655
Who is it?

793
01:03:18,364 --> 01:03:20,937
I'm here to get Professor Parnar's Imagination.

794
01:03:44,232 --> 01:03:45,370
Here.

795
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:49,749
Excuse me...

796
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:55,967
You're not a DVD shop attendant, right?

797
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:59,187
We seem to have met somewhere.

798
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:00,561
What?
