3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,969
What time is it?

4
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,575
Who is it?

5
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:25,252
<i>It's me.</i>

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,048
Yes...

7
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:34,880
Father?

8
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,719
Father, what are you doing here
at this hour?

9
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,117
What is this?

10
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:43,813
One shot.

11
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,273
Huh?

12
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,326
What is it?

13
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,108
Red vinegar.

14
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,333
They say it's a drink that
can preserve youthful skin.

15
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:02,802
I'll deliver some every morning.

16
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,562
Every morning?

17
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,751
Go and get dressed.

18
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,662
Let's go exercise.

19
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:09,993
Father!

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,198
It bothers me to have so much free time.

21
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,795
It's been 2 weeks since you retired.

22
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:24,615
I thought you said you were finding
housekeeping fun. Are you sick of it already?

23
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,213
Go on a seon*.

24
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,213
<i>{\a6}*Seon or Matseon = Meeting/date,
set by a matchmaker, with marriage in mind.</i>

25
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,991
If you don't want to go on a seon,
you can try your best with Hypochondriac.

26
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,560
Father...

27
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:37,626
I've thought about it very carefully,

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,684
and it's because he is the way he is
that he's been left as your share.

29
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,489
My share?

30
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,970
And it's up to you?

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,092
There have been 3 seons requested for you,
and 2 are remarriage candidates.

32
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,938
If you get a year older,

33
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,465
you'll be looking at remarriage
candidates with kids.

34
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,213
Are you not grasping your situation?

35
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,741
Did those kind of seon situations
really come in?

36
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,145
You can try your luck with Hypochondriac.

37
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:08,439
Or go on the seons that I snap up
for you, do one or the other.

38
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,920
Until then,

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm planning to come over to
your house with this juice of youth.

40
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,325
Father, please!

41
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:18,300
Why do you think...

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,677
Hypochondriac always looks
for an excuse to come see you?

43
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:26,575
There are times he comes and
he's really sick.

44
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:30,675
And you, who keeps seeing him
even though you know he's full of it.

45
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:33,601
You're interested in the guy.

46
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,799
Father, do you want me to look
into a volunteer position for you?

47
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,620
Spending the rest of your years
like this is really unproductive.

48
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:46,853
Tomorrow at lunch, a couple manager
from the matchmakers will come see you.

49
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,871
Answer all her questions honestly.

50
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,181
Father!

51
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,748
See you tomorrow.

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,200
He was quiet for a few days.
Why's he starting up again?

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,531
Father!

54
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,303
Good morning.

55
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:16,597
You're probably hungry.

56
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,008
Eat.

57
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,639
It really is nice to be alone, right?

58
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:30,025
Have 2 in a tank,
and the water will just get dirty.

59
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:32,343
And you only get half of the oxygen.

60
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:36,917
When you swim and your fins brush,
it's just annoying.

61
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:44,927
<i>[8. I said I didn't like marriage...
did I say I didn't like women?]</i>

62
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,445
Oh, let me take that.

63
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:54,647
Thank you.

64
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,150
Who else is coming?

65
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,726
Chief Kim of orthopedics from
the head office.

66
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,164
President Nam from the obstetrics practice.

67
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:01,435
And, university Professor Kim.

68
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,496
We've agreed to play as couples.

69
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,965
Sounds like all interesting people
are coming.

70
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,145
Right.

71
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,326
Ah, wait a sec.

72
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,256
You don't think anyone would
be ridiculous enough to bring their wives?

73
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:12,802
Unlikely.

74
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,718
Suggest that we bet on the golf.

75
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:25,647
I'll get your energy going with the clubs
you bought for me last time, President.

76
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:30,176
Aye, I keep telling you I'm not
president yet.

77
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:31,558
Listen to that modesty.

78
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:32,566
Geez.

79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,259
Anytime, I will run to you.

80
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:42,291
Whoa whoa, la la, I love you,
I LOVE YOU...

81
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:57,655
Ye Won, this song is the song
that your dad sang when he proposed.

82
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:02,507
Mom. Do I have to go take extra classes
on Sunday?

83
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:07,331
Ye Won, when you grow up, I wonder
what man will sing you this kind of song...

84
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,725
Oh! It's Daddy!

85
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:28,711
That woman keeps looking at us.

86
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,973
H-honey...

87
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,175
Honey!

88
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,695
Ye Won, your belt is on, right?

89
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,713
Hold on tight.

90
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,360
Do you think she saw me?
Isn't it possible she didnt' see me?

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,421
Of course she saw you.
It's her husband's car.

92
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,058
For now, just flee.

93
00:05:58,178 --> 00:06:02,244
Why should I flee when we haven't done
anything wrong? I haven't done anything.

94
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,206
What?

95
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:08,375
It is just the 2 of them, isn't it?

96
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:09,715
Who is that woman?

97
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:12,769
Mommy, it's Daddy, right?

98
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,164
Be quiet.

99
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:21,635
Mommy, go faster! How fun!

100
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:24,447
Ye Won, keep your mouth shut.

101
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:34,690
I see... you're making a run for it.

102
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,490
Park Kwang Nam,
so you see Jo Yun Hee as a joke, huh?

103
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,618
That kind of excuse will not go over
with your wife.

104
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,173
First just find a hole to slip out
if here, eh?

105
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:49,148
A hole to slip out?

106
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,178
A hole...

107
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,343
Ahh!

108
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:55,691
Huh? Oh!

109
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,031
Aigoo, oh no!

110
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,779
Park Kwang Nam, you better answer
your phone.

111
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,505
I totally caught you today.

112
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,591
Institutional gathering, my foot.

113
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,876
So you think you'll get away
with a u-turn?

114
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,006
Use mine, use mine.

115
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,296
Uh, uh

116
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:31,157
010... uh... 9367-9357-0615.

117
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:46,806
Yes.

118
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:47,558
Hello!

119
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,885
This is Kwang Nam, Kwang Nam!
Jae Hee, where are you?

120
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,438
I'm soaking up the sun.

121
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,919
Oh, Jae Hee!

122
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,182
Save me this once, huh?
Save me just once!

123
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:03,626
Why don't you help me?

124
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:07,053
Jae Hee!

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,620
Hello?

126
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,779
Hello?!

127
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,196
Hello!

128
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:12,463
Did he hang up?

129
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:18,632
Where do you think you're going?

130
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,117
You're dead.

131
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:42,362
Oh, oh...
Ph-phone...

132
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:43,706
Here, here.

133
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,435
What?

134
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,217
Jae Hee.

135
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,793
I really need you to come out right now.

136
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:59,372
Don't argue, just come out no matter what.

137
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:01,540
It's Chicago, Chicago!

138
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,879
What?

139
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:12,363
Hey.

140
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:14,905
If we were just gonna hang out like this,
home would have been better,

141
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,914
and save the cost of coffee.

142
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,694
Seems like you're trying to
get into my place every chance you get.

143
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,375
Shall I help you?

144
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:30,137
But do you think they'll read
a marketing document from an intern?

145
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:32,288
You have to make them read it.

146
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:34,907
Give it to me. I'll help you.

147
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:38,620
What?!

148
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,767
Does that make any sense?!

149
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:44,432
It's my brother's girlfriend?

150
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,235
This lady?!

151
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:50,077
Unni, you're Uncle's girlfriend?

152
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:55,177
Keep your voice down. Ye Won's here...

153
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,753
and you're scaring her.

154
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:01,767
Ye Won, plug your ears real tight.

155
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,258
Little one, do you want to listen to this?

156
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:18,404
Listen, Man, if you're going to lie,
do it right.

157
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:23,233
You're talking about my brother,
who hasn't dated a woman to the ripe age of 40

158
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,793
Why in the world does he want me
to come down?

159
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,682
Hey, Jae Hee!

160
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,261
Just a sec...

161
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,365
What, what?

162
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,694
Save me this once, huh?

163
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,412
What?

164
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:45,619
I met your girlfriend to give her
a consultation,

165
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:49,183
but your sister has totally got
the wrong idea...

166
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:54,657
Huh?

167
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,641
You came?

168
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,745
<i>Uncle!</i>

169
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,985
Sit, sit. Sit.

170
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,604
Sit, it's okay.

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,081
Aren't you going to sit down?!

172
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,992
Oh, yes, I should sit.

173
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:23,034
Oppa, I know you can't lie, so...

174
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,787
I'll believe your word.

175
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,085
Ahh, well, the fact that Hwa Ran
is your girlfriend,

176
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,053
please confirm it.

177
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:44,094
A little while ago, there was an accident,

178
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:47,083
and your brother helped me.
That's when I met him.

179
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,438
Right?

180
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,786
After that, we saw each other
a couple of times,

181
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,979
and it turns out we have
the same taste in movies, ah...

182
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,926
Did you finish watching that film?

183
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,451
Mommy.

184
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,537
It's past my class time.

185
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:12,204
It's okay if I don't go today, right?

186
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,365
It's Sunday, and she takes classes?

187
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:21,930
That's what bugs me.
And it's always at Sparta.

188
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,048
Don't blaspheme Sparta.

189
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:29,075
Sparta's sole objective is to raise
healty citizens.

190
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:32,082
Institutes that drive children hard
are fundamentally...

191
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,534
Oppa! Answer the question!

192
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:38,211
Is this lady your girlfriend?

193
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:40,774
You're dating?

194
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,414
No comment.

195
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,797
I'm not a "girlfriend" just yet.

196
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,028
It's just at the starting phase...

197
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:06,404
Us.

198
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:16,732
What the...

199
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,259
That guy...

200
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:19,829
Oppa, I'm going!

201
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,581
Yeah, I'm going too.

202
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,708
Since it's ended up this way,
let's just let your sister feel reassured.

203
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,095
Shock, shock, total shock...

204
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:44,121
That ahjussi and a woman?

205
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,541
Aye, look over here so we can see
your face.

206
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,444
I can't see.

207
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,793
Her legs are killer, though.

208
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,922
Is that all you see?

209
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,761
It went over okay, don't you think?

210
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:03,085
She's probably acting dumb like
she's been convinced.

211
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:06,978
Wives, you see, fundamentally want
to believe their husbands.

212
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,666
Even though they've witnessed
their husbands with another woman,

213
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:14,531
"I was never seeing her!" is the
answer that wives basically want to hear.

214
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:19,098
As a man who knows women so well,
why are you still alone?

215
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:23,356
I don't want that kind of relationship.

216
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:27,356
In any case, we ended up meeting again
like this.

217
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:34,269
Thank you. Oh, and there's nothing
between Presiden Park and me.

218
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,043
Well, you don't need to make
any explanations to me.

219
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,018
Then, I'll see you again later.

220
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,911
Taxi!

221
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,061
Again?

222
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,166
Again why?

223
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,220
- Chief!
- Ahjussi!

224
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,157
Can you do this?

225
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,405
We saw everything and we heard
everything! Your girlfriend?

226
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,405
<i>When did you start seeing her?</i>

227
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,831
Hey! She said it's just starting.

228
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:03,971
Tell us...

229
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,649
- Tell us, c'mon!
- It's private.

230
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,702
You meet with women.
You're normal after all.

231
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,025
Normal?

232
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:13,701
Ahhh, I wish we'd seen her face.

233
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,905
Is she pretty?

234
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,776
From the back, you guys looked
really good together.

235
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:20,389
Seeing you together, even you
looked really cool.

236
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:23,372
Right, the age difference looked
totally classy.

237
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:25,135
What does she do?

238
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,264
<i>[The Wild Horse... Business Club]</i>

239
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,060
Business.

240
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:33,314
Business?

241
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,798
What business?

242
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,852
Restaurant business speculator*.

243
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,852
<i>{\a6}(speculator = keunsohn).</i>

244
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,170
Big hand -Big hand.*

245
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,170
<i>{\a6}(big hand = keun sohn)</i>

246
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,718
Whoa...

247
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,844
Some sign of your presence, please!

248
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,457
What is that?

249
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,382
Why are you here?

250
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:05,038
My head hurts.

251
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,920
It's lunch time, so why are you here?

252
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,896
So your head hurts.
Why could that be?

253
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,445
And I've had dry heaves.

254
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,230
Dry heaves?

255
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,468
Just a little.

256
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,103
Since when?

257
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,146
Since my workout yesterday.

258
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,995
What did you do in your workout?

259
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,920
I ran quite a bit on the treadmill.

260
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,328
You didn't drink during your
workout, did you?

261
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,909
I drank after I finished.

262
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,210
Lift your shirt.

263
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,158
Okay, your button.

264
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,314
Patient Jo Jae Hee...

265
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,798
Oh my... I guess he's already here.

266
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,271
It seems like dehydration.

267
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,020
If you're really thirsty after working out,

268
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:17,090
you've already missed your chance
to hydrate properly.

269
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,735
During your workout,
you need to regularly drink water...

270
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,484
It's your father.

271
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,548
I saw it too.

272
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,416
Tell him I'll call him back!

273
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,360
That call's your father too, isn't it?

274
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,252
I see you've grasped my father's
personality.

275
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:47,595
The man who marries you,
has to automatically embrace

276
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:50,915
your father's relentless personality
as part of his family.

277
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,235
Yes, probably.

278
00:19:56,202 --> 00:20:00,390
Shouldn't you let that man in that
envelope over there know beforehand?

279
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,620
So, are you going to meet him?

280
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,050
I'll take care of my business.

281
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:16,679
Your father seems to really want it,
so why don't you go on the seon?

282
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,426
I guess you are concerned about
your health.

283
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,835
Working out all of a sudden.

284
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:28,863
It's not about the health.

285
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:31,874
I'm thinking about bulking up some muscle.

286
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:34,580
Bulk up your muscle for what purpose?

287
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,375
It's not like you have a girlfriend
to show, is it?

288
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,503
For me, you see,

289
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,331
it's not to show anyone,

290
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:46,266
but for me, it's to increase
my life's worth that I work out.

291
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,610
Eun Hee...

292
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,753
Don't ride in an ambulance from
trying to increasing your life's worth,

293
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,161
During your workouts, you must hydrate,

294
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,516
and take moderate breaks.

295
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,043
You understand?

296
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,185
Oh, oh, my leg.

297
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:18,454
Will you be all right?

298
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,397
and totally...

299
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:29,913
You're here?

300
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,564
Aigoo.

301
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,909
What kind of woman is she?

302
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,134
What?

303
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,308
Your girlfriend.

304
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,562
You...

305
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,035
Hey, you, seeing a woman?

306
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,288
You have a man too, Mun Seok Hwan.

307
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:55,675
It must be true.

308
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:58,360
Hey, are you really seeing a woman?

309
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,005
Then, are you really seeing Mun Seok Hwan?

310
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:09,492
I can't see you and Mun Seok Hwan
as a couple.

311
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:12,158
What are you thinking?

312
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,995
No, really, weren't you someone
who had no interest in dating?

313
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,522
I've never said that I didn't.

314
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,444
I have said that I had no interest
in marriage.

315
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:38,546
It's marriage I don't have an interest in.

316
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,772
It's not that I don't have an interest
in dating.

317
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,514
How did you know?

318
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:45,707
I heard it from Jo Jae Hee.

319
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,505
Why did he say that kind of thing to you?

320
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,397
I don't know.

321
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:54,946
You know he's a pro at telling you things
you didn't ask for.

322
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:55,913
Right.

323
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:59,349
And he just spins and avoids
your real questions.

324
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,145
Always sticking in something
he doesn't have to say.

325
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:06,145
So, Jo Jae Hee has a girlfriend.

326
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:09,358
Whatever.

327
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:13,186
Darn, I should have looked at her face.

328
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:14,945
You didn't see her face?

329
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,487
We only saw her back,

330
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:22,268
but from Hyun Kyu sensed that
she was between 25 and 27.

331
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,677
He says that's what her leg lines said.

332
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,526
He could tell that from the legs?

333
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:30,225
This 2nd floor bedroom,

334
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:32,031
and this 3rd floor sitting room...

335
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:33,945
I'd like to change the color of the door.

336
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:35,924
And Hyun Kyu...

337
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,236
Yes?

338
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:39,871
Hwa Ran?

339
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,645
Ahh, well, the fact that Hwa Ran is
your girlfriend,

340
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,645
please confirm it.

341
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,159
And so?

342
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,040
What?

343
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:57,836
Who is Hwa Ran?

344
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,427
Why have you come here?

345
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,618
- Perhaps...
- How did you know where my office was?

346
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:04,113
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

347
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:17,463
Are you mad because I came so suddenly?

348
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,936
Just get to the point of why you're here.

349
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:21,904
There was a movie I really wanted to see,

350
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:25,363
but my friend who was going
to see it with me flaked.

351
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:27,126
And so?

352
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,362
Do you want to go see it with me?

353
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:33,398
It's a piece by Gilliam, the director
of Professor Parnar's Imagination.

354
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:40,796
Is it, perhaps, this one?

355
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:17,331
Over 25.

356
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,729
Under 27?

357
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:24,506
I...

358
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,689
don't like marriage.

359
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:31,227
However,

360
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,963
dating is okay.

361
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,501
That's all right,

362
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,910
because I'm still young.

363
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,114
Whether it's dating or marriage,
do whatever you like.

364
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,159
It's a drama that showed yesterday at 10.

365
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:41,587
The dramas that show an old maid living
fine and happily... stop making those.

366
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:45,070
Must you always show our citizens

367
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:50,109
that those who aren't married and
living alone are enjoying life?

368
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,039
I've even been seeing news

369
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,325
about the huge sums of money the
government spends

370
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,100
addressing falling birthrates!

371
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,094
Father, today is Sunday.

372
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:08,180
It's a day of rest.

373
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,008
That's why I came a little later
this morning.

374
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,675
It's 8. I was on call last night.

375
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:14,094
One shot.

376
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:15,914
Father, what is that?

377
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,935
Oh, hey! Open up!

378
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:23,032
Hey! Open the door, open the door!

379
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:24,457
Are you really going to be like this?

380
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,457
Young Joon unnie, save me.

381
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,529
My father is driving me crazy!

382
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,658
Did he come again today?

383
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:34,389
I feel like I'm gonna die.

384
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,696
Hey, leave him to me.

385
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,115
Send him to my shop.

386
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,868
I'll put him to work and sap
all his strength.

387
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:44,395
Really?

388
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,887
I'm so grateful, Unnie.
I won't forget this blessing.

389
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:49,478
No, Unnie.

390
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:52,210
If you have some manual labor,
let me do it.

391
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,317
So I can rest my mind. Huh?

392
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:56,426
Rest your mind?

393
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,556
I'll go with Father.
Okay?

394
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:18,124
Have some while you watch.

395
00:28:19,027 --> 00:28:20,855
No, thank you.

396
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,629
I've seen this on DVD.

397
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:30,968
I wanted to see this movie
on the big screen so I held off.

398
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:35,197
Oh, there's a turn in the movie after this.

399
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,154
Shall I tell you what it is?

400
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:41,025
Do you think I held off watching
the DVD so you could tell me?

401
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:42,927
Then, before I say anything,
you better eat one.

402
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:45,400
I made these so we could eat them together.

403
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,443
Are you threatening me?

404
00:28:47,563 --> 00:28:49,465
So after this, what happens is...

405
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,059
A dog?

406
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,265
I like meat.

407
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,680
Today?

408
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,605
I really can't today.

409
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:26,970
Hey, are you really going to be like this?

410
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,045
Huh?

411
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,325
Yesterday...

412
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:34,067
Yesterday, Jae Hee made a ruckus,
so everyone at the site are a mess.

413
00:29:34,187 --> 00:29:38,228
How could they not be a mess
when they now have to work on Sunday?

414
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:42,013
Come out and help me.

415
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,142
What are you doing right now?

416
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:45,561
Just a minute.

417
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,285
Say hello.

418
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,532
Hello.

419
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:51,629
Huh!

420
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:56,532
Foreman!

421
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,534
Who is it?

422
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,534
Keep up the good work, then.

423
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:02,513
Let's go.

424
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,878
Hello? Hel...

425
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,497
Foreman.

426
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,830
Foreman!

427
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,121
If you stack those like that,
you're asking for an accident.

428
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,734
What kind of circus is this?

429
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:21,551
Because of that little error. He wants us
to do the whole thing over again?

430
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:26,130
You know better than anyone what
could happen with an error made early on.

431
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,507
Since you've agreed to do it,
do it with a nice attitude, eh?

432
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,152
It was an error of 6mm!

433
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:33,829
Is that going to topple a house?

434
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,344
It's not like we're building a universe
or anything.

435
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:38,183
In building a house, what's the problem
with a 6mm error?!

436
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,236
In all my years of... that little...

437
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,430
See if I ever work with that jerk again!

438
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,028
This time, I really really mean it!

439
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:49,297
Foreman, shall we have a
meat party tonight?

440
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,781
No thanks.

441
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:54,425
Jae Hee says he'll personally
foot the bill for the party.

442
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:58,296
Let's live a little on the jerk's
tab tonight.

443
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,124
Really?

444
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:01,586
Really!

445
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,062
I'm in!

446
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:06,966
- Hey, hurry, hurry!
- Let's go!

447
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:07,743
Come on down.

448
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:10,777
Eat up!

449
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,132
- Okay!
- Okay!

450
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,616
Eat up.

451
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:15,422
Here...

452
00:31:18,696 --> 00:31:19,492
Here...

453
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,127
Pour it in...

454
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:23,707
What's that?

455
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:25,153
Oh my...

456
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:29,998
Aigoo, big trouble!

457
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:32,922
What do we do?
He must have been hurt!

458
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:34,906
Hurry, hurry...

459
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:37,702
He quit doing what he's always done,

460
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:41,616
so I understand he wants to keeps
moving to avoid depression, but...

461
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,207
Mun Jung,

462
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,615
there, that man.

463
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:48,389
What the?

464
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,744
He must be drinking alone.

465
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,436
He's got a girl.

466
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,081
It must be his girlfriend.

467
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:07,770
Girlfriend?

468
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:10,694
They say he has one.

469
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,952
Are you okay?

470
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,727
What do you mean am I okay?
What does it matter to me?

471
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:22,060
Wasn't he frequenting the hospital
because he liked you?

472
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,297
Aigoo, what kind of...

473
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,748
Oh my, no...

474
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,852
You're crazy, crazy, crazy!

475
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,221
Particularly, in the flower garden,

476
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,221
when the man and woman were
facing each other.

477
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:35,981
That was my favorite part too.

478
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:38,303
Right, we're really alike.

479
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,336
- This is complimentary.
- Thank you.

480
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:45,238
Go, go...

481
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:05,255
You must work out a lot.

482
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,325
Usually bachelors don't take care
of themselves.

483
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:13,508
Can I feel them once?

484
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:22,117
Oh, it's really hard. Wow!

485
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,353
This side too.

486
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,248
Holy cow, they've got to be joking.

487
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:37,258
Huh?

488
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:39,925
Your father even did his teeth for free,
and he...

489
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:41,538
Be quiet. He'll hear you.

490
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:42,943
Hear what?

491
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,710
<i>He's so engrossed in her,
he can't see or hear anything.</i>

492
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:49,839
He really probably couldn't hear anything.

493
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,903
How can he act so annoyingly?

494
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:55,297
Aigoo, your father treated him so...

495
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,286
Oh my... hey, hey, hey...

496
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:02,050
Oh? What's this?

497
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:07,627
It seemed like it flew over here.

498
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,842
It looked like it hit your head.
Are you okay?

499
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:11,547
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're okay?

500
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:14,905
Anyway...

501
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,765
Chae Won, come take this!

502
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,045
I sent away that part-timer.

503
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:30,486
Excuse me?

504
00:34:30,606 --> 00:34:33,542
Her work really didn't satisfy me
so I sent her away.

505
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,521
President!

506
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,607
If you fire the employees at your whim,
what am I supposed to do?!

507
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,908
She said she would die before
cutting her nails.

508
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:47,058
Is that acceptable at a place
that sells food?

509
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:51,488
Look.

510
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:57,025
If you shoot it like this, it's too boring.

511
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,713
Aye, this is turning out to be stressful.

512
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:02,947
If you set out to learn something,

513
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:05,442
you have to put everything into it
and master it.

514
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,724
So then, I who agreed to teach you
can feel useful.

515
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,562
Let me see.

516
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,210
You shoot well.

517
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,726
Isn't it because this camera's cheap?

518
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:25,554
For a guy with no money,
that camera looks pretty expensive.

519
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,748
I save my money to buy things like this.

520
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:34,791
I have to buy nice accessories for
the camera too.

521
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:39,979
And every 3 years or so, I'll need
to go abroad and leisurely see the sites.

522
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:45,523
How can you just shoot so carelessly? Huh?

523
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:49,846
Put some affection into a picture.

524
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:53,314
Aish, I guess I don't feel any
affection for you!

525
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:55,723
Watch me do it.

526
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,703
Just a sec.

527
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,207
Who is it now?

528
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,757
This ahjumma, really...

529
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:06,649
What?

530
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:10,508
An accident?!

531
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,315
Yes, I understand.

532
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:15,605
Yes.

533
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:19,331
Yu Jin.

534
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,180
Go on ahead.

535
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:23,610
You'll stay on your own?

536
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:25,761
I need to take a few more pictures.

537
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:29,291
If I want to put it in the marketing
materials, I still have to take a ton more.

538
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:32,495
I really feel bad.

539
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:33,786
It's okay.

540
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:35,162
Hey.

541
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:38,087
If you're that sorry, leave me your camera.

542
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,574
I want to try taking pictures with that.

543
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:40,868
This?

544
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:43,578
But it's only for special use.

545
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:46,008
What, is it too nice?

546
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:47,642
Are you afraid I'm going to break it?

547
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,234
No.

548
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:57,694
Hey! Yu Jin.

549
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:00,517
Look at you cowering.

550
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,969
I was seriously startled.

551
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,012
Anyhow, be careful with the camera.

552
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:08,329
And watch the bag here.

553
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,394
- I'll leave it
- Go.

554
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:11,792
Okay.

555
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:13,383
Hurry and go!

556
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,908
Aye, I thought the planks fell
and injured the boy...

557
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:40,424
I thought it was some huge accident.

558
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:42,263
That's what I thought at first too.

559
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:45,188
How lucky is it that he wasn't hurt?

560
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:47,833
What if there had been an a injury
accident on site?

561
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:49,769
How dreadful.

562
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:55,026
Look, I'm still shaking.

563
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:56,897
Oh geez.

564
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,074
Oh?

565
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:07,655
Why is she like this?

566
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:10,171
Didn't you say mother and son
were both fine?

567
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,627
Didn't you say they weren't injured,
but were just startled?

568
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:18,380
Do you know how shocked and scared I was
that something horrible had happened?

569
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:21,326
From such a bold woman...

570
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,780
Do you want to take a sedative
before we go?

571
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:29,221
My bag. Where's my bag?

572
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,199
Hey, my bag.

573
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:35,454
Even if things were chaotic...

574
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:38,551
What kind of sloppiness is this
from a woman?

575
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,231
Aigoo. How many times do I have
to tell them

576
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,856
that stacking planks like this
is dangerous?

577
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:47,340
Why does everyone have a fit rather
than do their jobs?

578
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,878
They all leave it up to me to iron it out.

579
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:52,058
It's because you do iron it out.

580
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,449
But they must be good people.

581
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:59,470
If they wanted to sue,
it would have been quite a headache.

582
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,148
The kid will probably be okay, right?

583
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,937
Don't know who took them,
but they're pretty fantastic.

584
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,270
Aren't they?

585
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,353
Mmm... A construction site.

586
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,694
Who is this?

587
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:34,916
Let me ask you just one serious question.

588
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,034
You're scaring me.

589
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,278
This.

590
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:52,960
A few days ago, I saw you make
this exact document.

591
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,960
{\a6}[The Architect Who Protects Hanoks*, Mun Seok Hwan]

592
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:55,451
It was identical without a
single difference.

593
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,450
{\a6}*Hanoks: Traditional Korean-style Houses

594
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:59,627
What are you planning with
Mun Seok Hwan?

595
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,380
When Jae Hee and I started the company,

596
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:05,582
we said we were definitely going
to do this one thing.

597
00:40:06,164 --> 00:40:11,123
And for that, I needed
Mun Seok Hwan and pulled him in.

598
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:12,640
What project?

599
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:17,920
Something that our country's
architecture has never accomplished.

600
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:20,435
Just know that much.

601
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:27,467
Ah... When I open up an office later on,

602
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:30,410
will I be able to meet a partner like you?

603
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,852
Hey,

604
00:40:33,346 --> 00:40:35,934
I'm going to do your first product.

605
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,097
Fella...

606
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,637
Really?

607
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,540
Really, right?
Oh, she really means it.

608
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:44,952
I better record it.
Record, record.

609
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,973
Ah, but thinking about it ticks me off.

610
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:52,166
I'm running around working hard
for his benefit,

611
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:55,392
but he's going around dating a girl,
is that it?

612
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,354
<i>I'd like to see you again. Will you call me?
Hwa Ran.</i>

613
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:20,881
Oh... Hwa Ran.

614
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,353
With 3 hearts.

615
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:27,102
In this situation, the woman
is coming on strong.

616
00:41:27,222 --> 00:41:31,849
The man just needs to gently
pull and give, and softly accept her.

617
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:37,268
Shall I teach you the method?

618
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:59,670
$13 please.

619
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:02,369
Goodbye.

620
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:04,562
Excuse me.

621
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,175
Can I pay inhabitant tax here?

622
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:07,401
Yes, you can.

623
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:08,562
And this.

624
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:10,602
It's all the rage these days.

625
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:12,301
I didn't loan it out to anyone.

626
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:13,612
Would you like to watch it?

627
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,393
I've already seen it. I don't need it.

628
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:17,264
Seen it, seen it.

629
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:20,754
Excuse me, were you hitting on me right now?

630
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:21,678
No, no, no...

631
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:23,420
- Eh, it seems like you were.
- Oh, no.

632
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,291
Eh, I'm right.

633
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:26,630
Aren't I?

634
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,919
Ahhh.

635
00:42:38,532 --> 00:42:40,080
It's a cold.

636
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,076
I usually don't get colds in the winter.

637
00:42:43,196 --> 00:42:45,614
Did you sleep with the a/c on?

638
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:54,065
Have you heard the news about Jae Hee?

639
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,054
I saw them.

640
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,183
You saw that woman?

641
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:02,801
How?

642
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:06,715
By accident, I stumbled upon
their date scene.

643
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:09,941
She was young. And pretty.

644
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,711
The kid is really forward.

645
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:15,614
She even came to the office.

646
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:28,880
Is it okay for us to remain like this?

647
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,663
Excuse me?

648
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:37,190
I was working, so dating and
marriage were always on the backburner,

649
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:40,330
but suddenly, I'm nervous.

650
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,345
There is that sudden nervousness
that wakes your sleep at night.

651
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:50,947
Dr. Jang, you feel that too?

652
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:52,924
It's that age.

653
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:59,053
Aren't there any decent colleagues
around you?

654
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,752
It seems that doctors often marry
colleagues.

655
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,372
Ah, perhaps.

656
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:12,877
Manager Yun, you must also work
with many men, don't you?

657
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:17,957
Ah, I know a few decent men.

658
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,979
Shall I set you up?

659
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:24,751
Mmmm... I'll think about it.

660
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:30,622
And if I have some decent colleagues,
shall I set you up?

661
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:34,546
Ah... yes.

662
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:37,793
Let me get you a prescription.

663
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,691
<i>It rained last night.
I wanted to call.</i>

664
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:48,013
<i>I wait for your call. Hwa Ran.</i>

665
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:54,630
Ohhh, 3 hearts, all together, 6.

666
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,264
So, shall I help you?

667
00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,877
Ah, welcome.

668
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:04,339
Passionate love, ahh, nice.

669
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:07,414
No matter how you look at it,
this one is hot.

670
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,786
Meeting with Destiny.

671
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:23,944
2 people who fall in love at first sight?

672
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:26,589
2 people who meet through a matseon.

673
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,180
Is that really written on a cover?

674
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,313
I saw.

675
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,518
What?

676
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,743
You with a woman.

677
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,043
But it was a bit...

678
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,355
A bit?

679
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:45,903
What?

680
00:45:48,806 --> 00:45:50,312
Never mind.

681
00:45:51,903 --> 00:45:55,118
If you bring something up,
shouldn't you finish what you're saying?

682
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:57,225
Frankly,

683
00:45:57,978 --> 00:46:00,494
isn't the age difference rather large?

684
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,029
For a man, you see,

685
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:08,276
no matter how young the woman is,
there's no problem.

686
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:10,685
I guess the younger the better.

687
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:13,889
Since there are men who date women
young enough to be their daughters.

688
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:16,517
Though there isn't that many
the other way around.

689
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:18,646
It's unjust.

690
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:23,291
Young people are docile and
straightforward, which is nice.

691
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:27,597
They don't retort back at
every statement in a tiresome way.

692
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:32,057
My apologies for not being
docile and straightforward.

693
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:35,713
No need to apologize for being older.

694
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:45,823
What?

695
00:46:45,943 --> 00:46:47,307
Nothing.

696
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:55,766
What is it?

697
00:46:56,927 --> 00:47:03,482
To an old grandgpa, you'd probably appear
to be cute and docile, don't you think?

698
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,687
Thank you for your insight.

699
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:08,934
I'll keep it in mind.

700
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:11,662
I'm glad I could be helpful.

701
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:14,737
Then, please continue to enjoy
your pretty love

702
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,748
with your very green girlfriend.

703
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:21,191
Accident.

704
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:26,416
Yeah, I'm almost at the club.

705
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:27,642
Mmm.

706
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:49,711
It's Hwa Ran.

707
00:47:50,939 --> 00:47:53,305
Why don't you call?
I want to see you?

708
00:47:55,993 --> 00:47:56,746
Well...

709
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,961
Do I have to keep waiting for your call?

710
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:11,181
Do you have time on Saturday?

711
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:43,192
Father, I'll go on that seon.

712
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:47,020
I mean it.

713
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:50,681
Melodramas aren't really my taste.

714
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:52,487
Ah, is that so?

715
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:55,820
I don't really like them either.

716
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,285
We should have just taken one of
the duck boats. The rowing looks hard.

717
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:01,995
But you can't really call those boats.

718
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,328
You're actually pedalling.

719
00:49:03,448 --> 00:49:06,554
You have to be rowing for it to feel
like a boat.

720
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,328
Still, it looks tiring.

721
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,382
Not at all.

722
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,468
It's not hard at all.

723
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:13,661
Uh! Let's follow that duck boat.

724
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:15,468
Shall we?

725
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,474
Are you okay?

726
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:36,742
I'm okay.

727
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,541
Are you really okay?

728
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:53,345
Go in.

729
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,882
- Oh!
- It went in!

730
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,994
Uh! I wasn't sleeping.

731
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:07,198
Are you okay?

732
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:08,446
Yes.

733
00:51:09,715 --> 00:51:11,323
You look really tired.

734
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,721
I'm fine.

735
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,237
Oh, your face is completely baked.

736
00:51:15,357 --> 00:51:17,645
Oppa, did you put on sunscreen?

737
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:23,032
Oppa?

738
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:29,613
You should wear sunscreen in the summer.

739
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:31,376
Oh! I'm paying for it.

740
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:33,940
How much is it?

741
00:51:38,821 --> 00:51:40,886
Since we're here, I want to go shopping.

742
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:43,187
Can we go up for a bit before we go?

743
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:53,474
How is this?

744
00:51:55,494 --> 00:51:58,527
Is this better or is this better?

745
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:02,725
I'm not sure.

746
00:52:04,596 --> 00:52:06,274
Shall I try something else on?

747
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:09,177
Whatever you'd like.

748
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:10,834
Okay.

749
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,167
Can I... buy two?

750
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:23,936
Buy both of them for her.
They both look good on her.

751
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:24,904
Eh?

752
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:35,192
Uh, I see you here too.

753
00:52:35,312 --> 00:52:36,397
Hello.

754
00:52:36,517 --> 00:52:37,898
Oh, you've come?

755
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:39,984
You know the item I called about.

756
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:41,425
Please bring that out.

757
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:43,274
Go on with her, Honey.

758
00:52:57,278 --> 00:53:00,353
Shall I give you a bit of advice?

759
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:08,724
You call and select ahead, and buy that one.
That's the least expensive route.

760
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:13,369
Hmm? This one is all right too.

761
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:16,278
I'll get this one and the black one
I tried on.

762
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,090
Looks like she's worth some spending.

763
00:53:36,942 --> 00:53:39,028
Now, shall we go to dinner?

764
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:54,073
Wasn't you goal in going out with me...
this right here?

765
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,396
Let's not do this anymore.

766
00:54:26,186 --> 00:54:27,261
What?

767
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,940
I'm totally in her grasp.

768
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:41,532
My final shred of pride is gone
with her even tracking me.

769
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:44,693
Pathetic little...

770
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:49,374
Ah, but how do you know Hwa Ran?

771
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,750
It didn't seem like it was
your first meeting.

772
00:54:53,395 --> 00:54:54,858
I just do.

773
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:56,729
Don't get to know her too deeply.

774
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:00,901
A guy like you who doesn't know woman
is totally easy prey.

775
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:02,552
I ran here and there trying to avoid her

776
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:04,157
and ultimately forked over
a set of golf clubs.

777
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:06,596
Her goal is crystal clear.

778
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:10,145
She's a girl who estimates a guy's worth
when she first meets him.

779
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,024
Get me another glass.

780
00:55:13,325 --> 00:55:16,401
We have to give Yun Hee a
confirmation call

781
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,642
so you can attest I'm with you.

782
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:23,743
Look here.

783
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,313
<i>Hello?</i>

784
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:26,652
Honey. It's me.

785
00:55:26,772 --> 00:55:28,001
<i>Who are you?</i>

786
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:29,447
Jae Hee's next to me, Jae Hee.

787
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,437
<i>What is this? Honey? Hello?</i>

788
00:55:32,557 --> 00:55:33,899
Excuse me, sir.

789
00:55:35,154 --> 00:55:36,359
It's this way.

790
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:38,509
Ahhh.

791
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:40,316
<i>Aye, what is this?</i>

792
00:55:40,436 --> 00:55:42,036
- It must be here.
- Are you with Oppa?

793
00:55:42,156 --> 00:55:43,907
Hi, Honey, can you see us?

794
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,778
Yeah, we're together.

795
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,384
This isn't so...

796
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:05,958
Well, then...

797
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:52,950
Pressure has developed in your brain.

798
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:54,658
Brain?

799
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:57,482
Is it dangerous?

800
00:56:58,356 --> 00:56:59,726
What kind of workout was it?

801
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:02,318
Lifting weights.

802
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,793
It's not severe, so after a shot and
some medicine, you should feel better.

803
00:57:09,913 --> 00:57:12,760
But if the pain doesn't go away,
we'll take a CT scan.

804
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,949
Since you've been seeing your girlfriend,

805
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,548
you must have taken up
your workouts a notch.

806
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:22,720
And you said you were exercising to increase
the value of your life.

807
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,451
Ultimately, I guess your goal
was elsewhere.

808
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:29,394
What do you mean "girlfriend"?

809
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:32,405
Why are you suddenly acting dumb?

810
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:38,443
Huh. That woman is just someone I know.

811
00:57:40,938 --> 00:57:41,991
What?

812
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:44,464
But you said she was your girlfriend.

813
00:57:44,584 --> 00:57:46,405
I never said any such thing.

814
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:49,007
You said she was your girlfriend.
You did.

815
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:52,728
You said girlfriend and whatever.
I've never said any such thing.

816
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:55,025
This is unbelievable.

817
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,519
Why are you getting angry?

818
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,188
I agreed to go on a seon on Sunday!

819
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:07,586
What does that have to do with this?

820
00:58:10,104 --> 00:58:12,040
It has nothing to do with this.

821
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:16,233
It has nothing to do with this.

822
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:19,878
It was lie.

823
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:21,258
Isn't that too preposterous?

824
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:24,200
Then who is that woman?

825
00:58:24,944 --> 00:58:27,408
He says it's just a woman he knows.
I really...

826
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:31,211
Doctor, why are you getting so excited?

827
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:35,412
I'm not. I agreed to go on a seon.

828
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:39,111
What does that have to do with this?

829
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,756
It doesn't have anything to do with this.

830
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:44,172
No, actually, it does.

831
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:45,183
What?

832
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:48,000
When even a guy like Jo Jae Hee is dating,

833
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,484
I guess I was feeling like this wasn't
a time for me to just sit around.

834
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:54,337
Mmm, that's true.

835
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:59,026
Doctor, since it turned out like this, when
you go on your seon, make a real effort.

836
00:58:59,146 --> 00:59:02,509
<i>You never know what kind of
man you'll meet when in what situation.</i>

837
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,832
At this rate, Mr. Jo Jae Hee
may get married before you.

838
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:08,176
Go for it! Hmm?

839
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:30,368
What?

840
00:59:31,142 --> 00:59:35,185
Since they told me not to tell
Grandma, I didn't.

841
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:39,480
What?

842
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,985
You...

843
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,415
So, what... what is it?

844
00:59:43,824 --> 00:59:45,566
Are you leaving the old lady out?

845
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:47,587
It's not that.

846
00:59:48,038 --> 00:59:50,769
It seems Oppa is dating a woman,

847
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:53,909
but if you knew, you might get
too far ahead of things.

848
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:55,350
What?

849
00:59:56,188 --> 00:59:58,038
Jae Hee has a woman?

850
00:59:58,351 --> 01:00:01,340
It's rather suspicious as to
whether it's real...

851
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,415
but the two of them say so.

852
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:09,384
Aye! We told you it's true.
Why are you so suspicious?

853
01:00:10,352 --> 01:00:11,470
Hey.

854
01:00:13,578 --> 01:00:14,682
There is no woman.

855
01:00:15,664 --> 01:00:16,911
What?!

856
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:18,825
You...

857
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,630
What are you? So, then, have you been
playing with us up till now?

858
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,630
So, let's at least hear the story.

859
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,318
A woman? What woman?

860
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:30,735
Who is this woman?

861
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,995
A woman that has nothing to do with me.

862
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:35,888
Aigoo!

863
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:38,081
It figures.

864
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:42,258
You... need to see me a little later.

865
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:49,721
Jae Hee.

866
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:54,046
I really didn't want to say this...

867
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,860
What?

868
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:03,940
You don't, perhaps... like men, do you?

869
01:01:06,742 --> 01:01:09,236
If not, then never mind.

870
01:01:09,602 --> 01:01:12,677
I haven't been able to ask
because I was afraid of the answer.

871
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,134
I agreed to go on a seon on Sunday!

872
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:35,026
So what made her say that?

873
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:18,484
Yes, Father, I'll do well.

874
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:21,408
I've come out with a good attitude,
so don't worry.

875
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:26,312
Cautiously, womanly, I got it.

876
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:27,516
Okay.

877
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:36,456
Buy why here?
It's where I went on my last seon.

878
01:03:30,997 --> 01:03:35,399
Wow, how is it that 2 people can meet
on a seon twice?

879
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,227
Your name was...

880
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:41,309
I've gone on so many of these...
I get confused.

881
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:43,331
It's Jang Mun Jung.

882
01:03:44,062 --> 01:03:46,354
I must not have made a deep impression.

883
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:49,215
It's only been 3 months and
you can't remember.

884
01:03:50,462 --> 01:03:52,182
I do remember some things.

885
01:03:52,302 --> 01:03:54,914
Didn't you say you didn't like me because
I seemed like a Mama's Boy?

886
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:58,677
I heard you said I looked too old and
asked if my age was correct.

887
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:02,763
Then, why were you so enthusiastic
during our seon?

888
01:04:02,883 --> 01:04:05,301
You even made a big deal of my using
the wash cloth to wipe my sweat.

889
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:09,318
That didn't come from me.
I held back and didn't go into that.

890
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:28,392
Were you really born in '74?

891
01:04:35,117 --> 01:04:38,880
I'm sure you'll meet a really young lady.

892
01:04:39,504 --> 01:04:41,138
Let's leave.

893
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:42,858
Yes, let's go.

894
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,458
Unbelievable.

[Jo Jae Hee]

896
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,805
Hello?

897
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:09,406
I called to ask something.

898
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,331
Go ahead and ask.

899
01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:19,067
Ah, when I exercise, how much
should I rest?

900
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:22,465
What?

901
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:27,110
So, should I exercise for an hour, then
rest for 15 minutes, something like that?

902
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:32,560
Sure, that would be plenty,
don't you think?

903
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,560
I'm not a specialist in that area
so I'm not certain.

904
01:05:37,156 --> 01:05:38,489
I understand.

905
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,597
So you called to ask that?

906
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,102
Yes.

907
01:05:45,263 --> 01:05:47,629
Ah, today, that...

908
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,788
Today what?

909
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:54,799
Didn't you say you were going on a seon...

910
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:58,132
Hel...

911
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:02,492
Hello?

912
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,051
