Episode 3

4
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,400
Why did you come here? Did you follow us?

5
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:42,017
I'm only here because I followed
the Director.

6
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,350
That... That...

7
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:04,067
What I said just now... was actually
a joke.

8
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:06,067
I can't hear you!

9
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:11,214
Actually... It was a joke.

10
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:12,814
What did you say?

11
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,117
You still refuse to admit you're
wrong, right?

12
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,864
No.

13
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,350
Didn't you come to apologize?

14
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,967
Eh... Yes.

15
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:36,920
Then try saying it.

16
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:48,452
If it's so hard to say,

17
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:54,026
then this should be of some help
to you. Drink it.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,079
Drink it all.

19
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,176
It's that not enough?

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,138
Should I give you more?

21
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:40,813
Oh my!

22
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,732
- They hugged!
- They hugged!

23
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:49,120
What are you doing?! Oh my, oh my!
You don't have to be this way!

24
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,744
He knelt!

25
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,705
It doesn't seem like it!

26
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:56,900
What? Oh my, Jo Jae Hee!

27
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:58,841
Oh my!

28
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,997
He's down.

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,770
Jo Jae Hee sshi.

30
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,182
He's down.

31
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,055
<i>Jo Jae Hee!</i>

32
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,055
<i>Jo Jae Hee!</i>

33
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,752
Jo Jae Hee! Wake up!

34
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,150
Yes?

35
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:20,776
Pea...nut.

36
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,919
Are you allergic to peanuts?!

37
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,189
Yu Jin, were there peanuts in the cocktail?

38
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:30,522
I'm don't know.

39
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,626
Jo Jae Hee!
Ambulance, quick, call an ambulance.

40
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:39,406
Wake up! It's fine, everything's fine,
wake up.

41
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,478
Is he better now?

42
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:57,561
Yes.

43
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,655
I heard that the cocktail only had the
slightest amount of peanut butter in it.

44
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,719
Some people react a little more
severely.

45
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,656
He's alright now, you guys can stop
worrying and go home.

46
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,554
Yes, then we'll leave first.

47
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,207
- It's been hard on you.
- Go.

48
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,731
Why are you pulling that out?!

49
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,000
Wait till the treatment is over
before leaving.

50
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,175
Why are you so insensible, you can't even
bear with this?

51
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,379
The medicine is finished.

52
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:38,795
Oh yes, it is.

53
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,370
Just sit for a while, let me give you
a check up.

54
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,982
I'll lift up your shirt for a while.

55
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,644
Take a deep breath.

56
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:01,980
Let it out.

57
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:08,773
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,073
I didn't know you were allergic,

59
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:14,421
and I made you drink something
that had peanut butter in it.

60
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,214
I too...

61
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,739
Am sorry.

62
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:30,202
It is so difficult to apologize?

63
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:34,450
It's really been hard on you for
40 over years.

64
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:42,718
Crying so hard because of a joke,
Doctor Jang, you must be tired out too.

65
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,182
I've also seen times when
Mr. Jo was in tears.

66
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,516
There's absolutely no more problems
with your breathing, right?

67
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,864
Yes.

68
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,186
Let me look at your throat.

69
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,650
Ah, say ah.

70
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,650
Ah.

71
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,544
Ah.

72
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,448
The Man Who Can't Get Married

73
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:07,351
[The Lonely Financial Road]

74
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,026
Excuse me, I'll... I'll help you.

75
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:57,876
The best and first-rate speaker system!

76
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:01,237
No. 800, 200 power amp double-bass system!

77
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:04,822
It's finally being sold in the country!

78
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,061
How can it be so expensive?!

79
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:19,598
That's only the price for one speaker,
not the whole system.

80
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,314
But you said he bought it?

81
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,620
That's the point.

82
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,841
That ahjusshi is really a money-earner.

83
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:28,713
He doesn't have a family to feed,
nor a woman to please,

84
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,144
neither does he have friends to drink with.

85
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:33,300
If he doesn't spend any of it, he just
saves more and more of it.

86
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,161
How can there be such lonely thoughts?

87
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:39,794
His concept of spending is very different
from normal people.

88
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:40,876
How is it different?

89
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,858
What I'm saying is that, this isn't even
enough for one year of a child's education.

90
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,602
Are school fees that expensive?!

91
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:49,402
Let's say we're not looking at
public education,

92
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:53,402
he alone is freely enjoying a rich,
plentiful single life.

93
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:57,476
You've completely been brainwashed.
Even finding pleasure in the single life.

94
00:07:57,532 --> 00:08:02,752
It's worth thinking about. Men basically
love the single life.

95
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:07,630
When God created Eve, he took a rib
from Adam,

96
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,114
saying that he had given him wings.

97
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:15,914
<i>That's why I say, the more we want to fly,
the more people tie us down.</i>

98
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,676
<i>Yet our wings grow with leaps and bounds.</i>

99
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:22,411
I'm sorry, our hours of business are over.

100
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,411
Ah, yes.

101
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,588
Forget it, let's just split the bill.

102
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,911
What's wrong?

103
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,079
Whenever we looked at the menu to order,

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,861
you have no idea how worried
you looked, even I get frightened.

105
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,608
When did I?

106
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:49,364
I said I would treat you to a big meal
today, that's why I asked you out.

107
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,191
Give it to me, quick.

108
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708
I'm not innocent enough to pretend
I don't know

109
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,570
what financial situation you're in,
yet still ask for a treat.

110
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:59,408
Let me remind you. Don't remain single.

111
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:02,091
There's nothing more pitiful than a
penniless single.

112
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:07,505
Even though your heart has wings,
it needs money before it can take off.

113
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,505
Here.

114
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,558
Do you want me to organize this?

115
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:24,344
There's no need, right?

116
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:26,667
Oh, hold on.

117
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,638
Are you planning on buying an apartment?

118
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,805
I'm just taking a look. It happens that
the lease of my house is coming up.

119
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:36,032
Even you don't buy, you should move.

120
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,717
That neighborhood has too many
homeless people around.

121
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,044
He said he wouldn't let me be independent

122
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,044
if I were more than 5 kms away...

123
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,344
I didn't think that little neighborhood
would be like that.

124
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,155
Are you so eager to be independent?

125
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,058
Wait till you're over 30 and still living
with your parents.

126
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,402
Living with each other is like hell.

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,458
We'll leave first. You've worked hard.

128
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,647
You too.

129
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,647
<i>Bye.</i>

130
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,014
Hello.

131
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,597
Your hobbies are really...

132
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,108
Do you know him?

133
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,108
Is he a regular here too?

134
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:38,170
But... What kind of job does he have?
He comes everyday without fail.

135
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,800
You've worked hard.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,770
Be safe.

137
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:05,873
32 square meters, $640,000.

138
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,614
You scared me! Why didn't you make
any noise?!

139
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:23,964
32 square meters... It's quite good
if you live alone.

140
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,826
Even if you get married, both of you
can still live in it.

141
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:32,252
What do you mean 'if'?
What do you mean by that?

142
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,902
$640,000. You live up to your reputation
of being a doctor.

143
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,902
Isn't your income from construction
quite good too?

144
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,776
Not long ago, their was a piece on an
architect, what was his name?

145
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,791
You look at his houses,

146
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,876
that are luxurious mansions,
just their art collection is...

147
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,805
No matter how you put it, they must be
special cases to get on television, right?

148
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,311
Have you seen this film?

149
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,050
This DVD is pretty good.

150
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:14,823
It's dual sound, high definition.

151
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,761
Look at you being all happy.

152
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:22,005
Then... I've still got something on.

153
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,085
Yu Jin, it's me.

154
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:54,552
The medical report is out.
There's nothing wrong at all.

155
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,876
Really? There're no problem?

156
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,267
<i>Doctor, that's really a relief.</i>

157
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:04,076
Should we have dinner tonight?
I'll treat you to a big meal.

158
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:06,617
Yu Jin, could you make a copy for me?

159
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,932
We've recently released a new product,
and have to do marketing surveys.

160
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,744
I've been working overtime recently.

161
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:17,238
That's right, your internship review
is coming up soon, right?

162
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,326
Yes. If I want to survive and stay,
I have to perform a little better.

163
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,032
Okay, work hard.

164
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,032
Yes!

165
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:29,750
Yu Jin, the patissier said we could use
the kitchen now, let's go give it a try!

166
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,120
Really?!

167
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,455
Ah, copy! Hey, wait for me,
I'm going to make a copy of this!

168
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,747
The design is already ready, what do you
mean by they're backing out?

169
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:43,144
They said no matter what they couldn't
get $10,000.

170
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,144
There's nowhere we can cut costs.

171
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,055
Don't say that, let's try and think
of an idea.

172
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,055
Should we cut out the bathroom?

173
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,200
You should try and consider the
customers' position too.

174
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,800
Even though it's a waste, how would it be
if we changed the kitchen?

175
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,182
Let's not use this overhead component,
and nail it to the wall...

176
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,929
This hanging component is the main focus.

177
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,455
You can see the garden through it.
If we changed it, isn't that all destroyed?

178
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:10,385
If we have to do that, there's no
reason I should design this.

179
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,517
Just compromise a little.

180
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,765
Introduce them to a different architect.

181
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,702
Director,

182
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,600
after Sangye-dong, we have no other
jobs on our hands.

183
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,888
Changing the kitchen around a little
is not a bad idea either.

184
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:25,408
Are you a designer or a businessman?

185
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,179
I understand.

186
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,808
<i>Is Mr Jo Jae Hee around?</i>

187
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,070
Ah, just sit there, I'll go.

188
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,591
Do we have to give another job away again?

189
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,029
Are we going to give it to
Mun Seok Hwan again?

190
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,426
That person is really making it rich
because of us.

191
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,938
It's all a strategy.

192
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:48,938
Are you...

193
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:55,226
You're transferring all the jobs there, Manager,
you won't transfer over there either, will you?

194
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:02,467
If Manager leaves, how can that person
handle everything by himself?

195
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,467
The company will collapse.

196
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,823
Do you want to leave with me?

197
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:11,420
I want to stay by Director's side.

198
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:15,964
Aigoo, how obedient.

199
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,641
What did you buy that's making
you so happy?

200
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:22,929
The Roulette of Life.

201
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:26,711
The remake of the 1968 limited edition.

202
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,723
Isn't that the game where you throw
dice and buy land?

203
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,170
You aren't a child anymore.

204
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,655
You can't play that game alone, can you?

205
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,467
That's why?

206
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:44,367
Why can't I play it by myself?
All these weird people.

207
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,088
There aren't any patients, are there?

208
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:54,564
Yes. Doctor, I've paid the medical
insurance, and this as well.

209
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:01,214
Ah, that... Someone called.

210
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:05,035
Matchmaker?

211
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:13,650
Yes, not yet... Doctor is back,
please hold on.

212
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,576
He's called many times already,
when you weren't here.

213
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,194
Yes.

214
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,950
Yes, Dad.

215
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,950
How come you're the only person that's busy?

216
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,664
How can I be free all the time?

217
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:32,950
Really, you've embarrassed me in front
of the nurses,

218
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:33,970
why do you do this all the time?

219
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,150
Didn't I say you could leave a message
and I would call you back?

220
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:38,694
Is not knowing what to do and
not doing it wrong?

221
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:41,752
Because I couldn't contact you,
I'm starting to get a headache.

222
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:45,397
Ah, just change that habit of yours.

223
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,691
How can everything you want go your way?

224
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:51,061
Tomorrow at 3, make a trip to a
matchmaker's office in Seocho-dong.

225
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,935
Just go look for someone called
Choi Eun Seo.

226
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,650
Dad.

227
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:58,741
Didn't I tell you not to make
anymore applications?

228
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,632
It's an interview.

229
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:02,817
I'm definitely not going, and not going
for a matchmaking session.

230
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,135
Dad, I'm worried about your blood
pressure so...

231
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,655
Your qualifications didn't pass their
standards, so they want an interview.

232
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,458
Inter... Eh?

233
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:17,800
Out of 100 points, you only got 52 points,
just like your weight.

234
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:24,602
You really thought you were quite good,
that's such a pity.

235
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,667
So what is the reason that I can't
get married?

236
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:32,950
So I'm only worth 52 points, is that it?

237
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:39,244
Thank goodness, from now on you
will always be 52 points.

238
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:43,155
From 36 years old onwards, you get 0 points.

239
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,294
If other conditions don't change, no matter
if you're 40 or 50, you'll always fail.

240
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:51,579
On the marriage market you are
already helpless. I'm hanging up.

241
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,341
Ah, really.

242
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,987
[Oh Cha Gyo Matchmaking Agency]

243
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,755
Doctor! There's a patient.

244
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,755
Invite him in.

245
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,876
Please come in.

246
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,273
Where are you feeling uncomfortable?

247
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:45,526
I am Jo Jae Hee's mother.

248
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,497
Ah, is that so?

249
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:54,108
Jae Hee hasn't been bothering you, has he?

250
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,108
No, he hasn't.

251
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:02,000
Even though it's not much...

252
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:05,544
Oh, you don't have to do this,
I haven't done anything special.

253
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:09,491
Just accept it. It's just something polite.

254
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:14,129
Then... I'll eat it well.

255
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,129
Is there anywhere... you're feeling
uncomfortable?

256
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,632
Yes?

257
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,879
I've been feeling weak recently.

258
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,241
Have you been running a fever,
or had any other symptoms?

259
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:42,082
I don't think I've been having a fever.

260
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,805
Then, let me take a look at your throat.

261
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,847
Please say 'Ah'.

262
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,720
Ah.

263
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:55,235
Your throat seems fine.

264
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:58,029
There doesn't seem to be any especially
significant symptoms.

265
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,747
Maybe I'm stressed?

266
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:07,455
I have a son, who is not anxious at all
about getting married.

267
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:15,150
That child is just like me, an introvert.

268
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:18,405
That's why he acts that way, what can I do.

269
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:23,605
If he meets someone suitable, he doesn't know
how to hold on to her, isn't that right?

270
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:25,605
Yes.

271
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:29,458
But he's really successful in his career.

272
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:34,832
Getting the Architectural Culture Award,
and the Korean Design Award.

273
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:37,723
Is that so?

274
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,691
Oh my, you didn't know.

275
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:48,658
That child, has been serious about his work
and ambitious since he was young.

276
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,658
This, this...

277
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:52,817
The design that won the award.

278
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:59,485
This is the Seoul Architecture Award in 2005,
this is the 2008 Korea Design Award.

279
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:03,167
This is the 2008 Architectural Culture Award.

280
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:05,517
Ah, yes.

281
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:08,832
Jae Hee is quite a catch, isn't he?

282
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:13,847
You must be very proud.

283
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,847
I'll give you these.

284
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:17,511
Yes?

285
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:20,123
I still have the originals, it's okay.

286
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:36,214
You... You said something about
feeling weak, we could wait and see.

287
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:40,552
Watch your diet and nutrition intake, and...

288
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:43,558
pay attention to how many hours you rest.

289
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:48,755
What?

290
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:52,644
Lend me some money.

291
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,470
I borrowed some money from outside,
if Yun Hee's mother finds out, I'm dead.

292
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,020
You've given it to the women at the
Wild Horse club again, haven't you?

293
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,070
Her, let me tell you again,
I'm not having an affair.

294
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:06,535
If it were really the case, I wouldn't be
ableto ask you for a loan.

295
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,535
What's different about this?

296
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,535
It's pure.

297
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,691
Pure...

298
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:18,282
But you... How do you solve that?

299
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,032
What?

300
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:22,794
Ah, talking about purity,
I got reminded of it.

301
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,320
From what I know, you've never
even been in a relationship...

302
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:30,694
Do you have a obsession with cleanliness
that keeps you from going to those places?

303
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,694
You can't be...

304
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,326
Still a virgin, right?

305
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,326
I'm not lending you the money.

306
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,141
My whole life, I don't lend people money,
neither do I borrow money.

307
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,141
Ah, ah, save me.

308
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,347
How can the person who's maligning me,
have no drinking money?

309
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:49,973
All my pay is with Yun Hee's mother.
I'm only getting an allowance,

310
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:52,917
my position is about the same as Yun Hee's.

311
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,572
You can't even spend your own money
as you wish.

312
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,148
This is the result of getting married.

313
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:58,933
Time to eat!

314
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:01,832
Oh, oh.

315
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,091
What's wrong, you're acting strange.

316
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:08,216
Even though you earn much,
I don't see you as a millionaire.

317
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:12,011
Money you can spend freely...

318
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:16,729
How much money can you spend of
your own free will?

319
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:18,652
Have you spent all your allowance again?

320
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,202
Were the two of you scolding me
behind my back?

321
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:24,141
If you are single, you have your own money.

322
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,961
Once you're married, all your money goes
to your wife and children.

323
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:30,500
We're not here to listen to your thesis
on the single life.

324
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:31,635
Let's eat.

325
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:33,205
Yes.

326
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:39,320
Oppa, honestly, your inability to get
married is your fatal flaw, isn't it?

327
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:40,282
What?

328
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,835
Talking about some single life thesis
every opportunity you get,

329
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:46,688
that should be some kind of flaw, right?

330
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,955
It's not that I can't get married,
I don't want to.

331
00:23:51,526 --> 00:23:56,058
Is there a difference between not being able
to get married and not getting married?

332
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:58,879
He just hasn't met the right person.

333
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:02,944
Once Jae Hee meets his other half,
it'll be alright. Right?

334
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,446
I said I'm not getting married.

335
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,326
She's better than I thought.

336
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,154
What is?

337
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,355
She doesn't look that old either.

338
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,385
Who?

339
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:13,385
Doctor Jang Mun Jung.

340
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:21,397
She's very presentable, and pretty.

341
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,455
Mom's very satisfied.

342
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:26,455
Mom!

343
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,897
Aigoo, spring's trash is really formidable.

344
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,735
What's good about getting married for you?

345
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,435
You don't know how good Yun Hee
is to my parents.

346
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:40,258
Just because of that, I benefit.

347
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:43,129
Hey, let's go together. After I take the
trash out, I have to go buy bread.

348
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:00,644
Hello?

349
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:07,044
I can't watch a movie today.
I have an exam, I have to practice.

350
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,044
What exam is it?

351
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:12,152
It's an activity where we make bread
with the customers.

352
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,614
Hold on, let me park.

353
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:16,985
Park? Do you have a car?

354
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:21,726
No, I'm helping the director run some
errands, so I drove the company car.

355
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:27,688
What should I do, what should I do?

356
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:28,441
What?

357
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,441
I hit something!

358
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:35,794
What should I do, what should I do?!

359
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,023
Is it a big scratch?

360
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:40,264
Yes, and it's obvious! There's even a dent.

361
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,885
Knock at it first.

362
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,400
Around the dent, make a fist, pound pound.

363
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:47,076
Hey, it's not at that extent.

364
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:49,664
Ah, this is a foreign branded car.

365
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,985
What?

366
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:53,529
Ah, this repair will definitely cost me
a bomb.

367
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:56,323
Hey, quickly run!

368
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,638
It's right outside my apartment,
where can I run to?

369
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:00,011
Did you get paint on your car?

370
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,241
Oh, of course!

371
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:07,329
Ah, just clean the paint off first. Your
carpark doesn't have a CCTV camera, does it?

372
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,329
Camera?

373
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,329
Camera, camera, camera.

374
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,800
Ah, this is really heartbreaking. It's not
even been a long while since I bought it.

375
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:44,705
I'm sorry, I'll pay you back.

376
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:46,705
It's really a heartache.

377
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,855
I can go now, can't I?

378
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:53,538
I never said I wouldn't let you leave.

379
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:57,611
Being overly nice and your on-scene
analysis, is really touching.

380
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:01,155
I helped you hide it a little,
I've tried my best.

381
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,155
You helped me a little?

382
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,529
The part where you wanted to run away,
didn't I omit that for you?

383
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,529
That's basic loyalty.

384
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:11,588
Yes, yes. What touching neighborly feelings.

385
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,588
I'm leaving.

386
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:35,367
There's really nowhere I could get
the money from.

387
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,367
Ah, I'm going crazy.

388
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,097
Looks like I have to get married.

389
00:28:33,223 --> 00:28:35,323
In this game,

390
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:38,594
the only important point, is this part.

391
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:26,935
Okay, I've finished taking your photos.

392
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:27,914
It's been hard on you.

393
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,285
- Thank you for your hard work.
- It's all down to you.

394
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:37,555
They say I'm the featured perso
in The K magazine.

395
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:39,936
What's with the poses?

396
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,220
Actually the more shots I've taken, the less
I know what poses are more photogenic.

397
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:48,173
See it on next month's The K.

398
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,644
This is the information on one
of my juniors.

399
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:57,970
Once I mentioned the salary that you offer,
he said he'd fly over immediately tomorrow.

400
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,170
As Director Mun instructed,
he's very inspirational.

401
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,773
He doesn't have many flaws, and he has a
way with people. And pretty.

402
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:08,599
Manager Yun is a little disappointing.

403
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:13,973
Inspirational, with little flaws, good
with people, and pretty too.

404
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,820
Wasn't these the words I told you
when I made my confession?

405
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:18,820
Ah, disgusting.

406
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:21,441
Look at all the girls who like you,
Director Mun.

407
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:24,164
Now I really understand how varied
people's opinions are.

408
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,408
That's what I said too.

409
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:32,226
The salary that can entice someone from
abroad to take a plane back for an interview,

410
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,876
Why aren't you moved at all?

411
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:36,788
Because I would like to work with
the architect that I like.

412
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:41,252
Are you chasing me away like that?

413
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:44,182
With the confidence that
'My architect is the best'.

414
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,097
That is our business strategy.

415
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,323
Manager Yun.

416
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:58,355
Let's get married.

417
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,376
Sometimes you really make blind
confessions for no reason.

418
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,082
How could you look at it that way?

419
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:06,082
What if I were sincere?

420
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,864
From the start of the meeting till now,
there's been a woman propping up her chin,

421
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:12,635
waiting for Director to get off work.

422
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:14,635
Have you forgotten?

423
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:18,000
That's right.

424
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,135
Excuse me,

425
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:43,661
I hear that from the island models, there's
one with the sink separate from the island.

426
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,858
Ah, that type is over here.

427
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:46,958
Yes.

428
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,932
If I can use this, I can reduce
about 6 million.

429
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:05,676
Yes?

430
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:07,676
It's Jang Mun Jung.

431
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:12,376
Your mother left her scarf when she
was here for her check-up.

432
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:16,532
When I called her, she told me to
give it to you.

433
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,532
You can throw it out.

434
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,150
No, I can't.

435
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,997
From the dye that is high end,
it's expensive.

436
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:30,967
Old woman, she left it on purpose.

437
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:49,814
4.5 million.

438
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:58,938
It was dark last night so I didn't notice,
but now that I see you, you're very charming.

439
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,938
What?

440
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:04,017
Why is 4.5 million making you cry?

441
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:07,211
My youngests can make that in just 2 weeks.

442
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,088
When the money is ready, put it
in here, please.

443
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:14,114
Yes.

444
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:20,718
[Room Business Wild Stallion Manager
Lee Hwa Ran]

445
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:23,944
I could tell by her ambiance.

446
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:26,776
The car was in a man's name also.

447
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:30,535
I heard that those women's cars and houses
are provided by sponsors.

448
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,776
I guess it was true.

449
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,776
4.5 millions.

450
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,861
Because it's so ridiculous, I'm speechless.

451
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:41,917
The company car was in the accident,
so can't we use insurance?

452
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,179
I'm not even a regular employee.

453
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:44,835
Do you think they will?

454
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,170
If I bring it up for no reason and
get fired, that's worse.

455
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,967
Hey, try asking your parents for help.

456
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,555
I thought maybe I'll give them a call,
but it's not the right time.

457
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:55,555
They're worse off than I am.

458
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:57,555
My mom has no money for this.

459
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:04,311
With the deposit from my attic room,
I barely paid off my credit card bill...

460
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,726
It starts again.

461
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:10,302
If you get a loan, do you think you can
pay it off?

462
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,105
What can I do?

463
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:14,935
I have to use my cards to pay off
and work part-time.

464
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:17,232
Part-time...

465
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,938
Oh! Part-time job!

466
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:21,617
Do you have a good part-time job?

467
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,541
Yeah.

468
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:24,541
What?

469
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,332
This.

470
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,302
Get the money you lent to Tae Hyul.

471
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,626
You said it's about 5 millions.

472
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,508
Even if you're separated, you should
clear up debts.

473
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:39,879
He said he will when he gets the money.

474
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:26,402
Sorry, I'm late.

475
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,832
I'm sorry for bothering you on a holiday.

476
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:31,682
Now you know how to say sorry.

477
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,508
Are you happy?

478
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:37,897
I feel like I made a man more mature,
so I am happy.

479
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:40,623
Don't feel sorry.

480
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,423
I had some shopping to do, so I was
going to come out.

481
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,850
It's the same as me.

482
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,423
What would you like?

483
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,688
I'll have the ice coffee.

484
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,238
You're going to drink?

485
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:58,894
Am I not supposed to?

486
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,894
I just need to get the scarf.

487
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:04,368
I'm thirsty, that's why.

488
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:18,758
Before the coffee is served,
I'll give you the scarf first.

489
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:30,408
Where did it go?

490
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:35,550
That's strange. I brought it out with me.

491
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,020
Where did it go?

492
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,841
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,082
Well, then.

494
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:05,308
A.. are you going to go like this?

495
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:10,497
If I drink tea with you, I would be
falling into a certain someone's scheme.

496
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,314
Excuse me?

497
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:27,994
Why are you carrying this around?

498
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,044
This is a misunderstanding.

499
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:32,170
Your mother gave that to me.

500
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:36,708
So that old woman, I can't stop her.

501
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,523
What do you mean cherish?

502
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:43,605
- Am I some...
- From now on, please don't see my mother.

503
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,482
I'm not the one who went to see her.

504
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,482
Even if she comes as a patient,
don't meet her.

505
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:55,341
She has her son-in-law at that hospital,
so tell her to go to him.

506
00:37:55,432 --> 00:37:57,935
That's something you should take care of...

507
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:00,676
Then, what about you?

508
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,200
Why don't you go to the assistant director
instead of me?

509
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,391
You came twice last week.

510
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:09,582
I was there as a patient.

511
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:14,279
This!

512
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,708
The person who goes there to give you
this has a different purpose from me.

513
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:22,352
Then, do you think for another reason?

514
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:25,491
I will give the scarf to the
assistant director.

515
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:31,655
Then...

516
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:34,567
I will pay the bill.

517
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,914
I have no reason to let you pay
for my drink.

518
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,126
Does saying that you will pay the bill
politely make your mouth twist?

519
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:41,850
Why you!

520
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:56,547
Why are you giving this back to me?

521
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,244
Yes, Yu Jin.

522
00:39:08,294 --> 00:39:10,244
What are you doing?

523
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:14,191
While feeling victimized and hollow,
I'm waiting for my ice coffee.

524
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:19,620
Doctor, why do you think that when you
don't have money, you want to shop more?

525
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:22,382
Isn't there some kind of study on this
in psychology?

526
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,285
Is that why you called?

527
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,279
I don't have any money, but I want
to buy clothes.

528
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:32,850
I just came to do some window shopping just
to let my eyes feel luxury, when I found it.

529
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,285
What?

530
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:35,582
Your clothes!

531
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:40,447
The way I can see you wearing this dress
100%, it was made for you.

532
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,523
The fabric they use is good and
it's comfortable.

533
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,167
I want to buy it.

534
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,167
Ah, this feeling of happiness.

535
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,864
So this is what people call vicarious
happiness.

536
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,744
Doctor, you're wearing makeup.

537
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,298
You had a date, right?

538
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,594
What do you mean date?

539
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:09,364
Please give me this in black.

540
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,047
Are you going to buy 2?

541
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:18,944
Wow, two times this!

542
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:22,373
If you're going to buy 2, choose one
in another design.

543
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:23,300
It's a waste.

544
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:25,288
Rather than disliking another style,

545
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:28,564
buying 2 of the same style that suits me
is unregretful.

546
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,555
I think as you get older, your shopping
habits change.

547
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:35,688
The same with cosmetics.

548
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:41,317
Rather than color, you look at the substance
and you spend more money on underwear.

549
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:45,111
You're saying that rather than looking
pretty for others,

550
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:47,908
what's better for your body becomes
the priority.

551
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,770
You can say that.

552
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,432
In my 20s, my youth added to my
fashion style,

553
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:58,820
but somehow supportive underwear becomes
more important at my age.

554
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,635
An apartment purchase?

555
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:02,844
Yeah.

556
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,514
I don't have any stocks or bonds.

557
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,638
With my money and my name,

558
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:12,900
I never imagined that I would consider home
ownership and still not be married.

559
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:16,858
There's nothing to laugh about.

560
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,211
If you don't pay attention, time passes
by in an instant.

561
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,270
Still, how nice is it to have money
to buy a house.

562
00:41:23,311 --> 00:41:25,514
I'm grateful I can pay my credit cards off.

563
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:26,420
What?

564
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,420
It's just a situation I'm in.

565
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:30,420
Isn't your apartment really expensive?

566
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:32,938
On a young person's salary, it's impossible.

567
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,620
I thought your parents were supporting you.

568
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:41,173
A relative went abroad for 6 months for
business, so I'm living there for that time.

569
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,561
Oh, is that so?

570
00:41:54,197 --> 00:41:55,926
Jeez, he's so despicable.

571
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,226
Yesterday, in the apartment parking lot,
I scratched someone's car door.

572
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:03,823
That tattletale enthusiastically
told on me.

573
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:06,220
Even though I didn't see it, I can imagine.

574
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:08,441
Ewww.

575
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,179
What's that?

576
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,570
What are you going to do about that color?

577
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:20,047
That's not for your age!

578
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:22,950
If he wore that and went in front of kids,
they'll call the police.

579
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:24,950
I put 10,000 won on it.

580
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:28,776
I bet that he'll get body searched at
an overseas airport. 30,000 won.

581
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:38,550
He's not going to buy that, is he?

582
00:42:39,738 --> 00:42:42,376
Whew! Good decision.

583
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,694
That's right.

584
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,429
He's buying it!

585
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:48,879
He's buying it!

586
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:52,791
What's he going to do about all the
chicken feathers?

587
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:11,785
You're here?

588
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:19,688
Boss.

589
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:20,726
What?

590
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:25,797
Did you wear that hat from your house
all the way here?

591
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,382
Why?

592
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:30,935
Nothing.

593
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:34,726
If you have something to say about
the hat, go ahead.

594
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:38,129
I think it'll be better if you don't
wear it.

595
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,814
Don't people look at you weird?

596
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:08,735
Mun Seok Hwan updated.

597
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,223
You really made a hobby of looking
at his homepage.

598
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:16,914
At his age to take self-pictures and
updating is pitiful, that's why.

599
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:20,935
What about you going to check everyday?

600
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:24,820
He's certainly a bum with time on his hands.

601
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,341
That's what I'm saying.

602
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:36,629
What is this?

603
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,400
Oh. Bring that here.

604
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:54,744
Yeah?

605
00:44:54,976 --> 00:44:57,500
We'll be able to reduce 10 millions won.

606
00:44:57,852 --> 00:44:58,926
Really?

607
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,152
I found a different model for the sink
and island.

608
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,505
The concept won't change and the cost
will go down.

609
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:07,841
If we make a few minor changes,

610
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:11,208
and make the entrance design a little
simpler, it'll be possible.

611
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:15,891
You didn't already pass the
project on, right?

612
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,202
I never even looked into it.

613
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,791
I felt like you would make it possible.

614
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,923
When should I schedule the client meeting?

615
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:26,923
Anytime.

616
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:28,923
Okay.

617
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:32,400
Make the design modifications with this.

618
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:34,005
Yes.

619
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,964
Hello.

620
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:55,088
Oh! Hello.

621
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,211
How did you... here?

622
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:57,820
No.

623
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,502
It's my day off, so I came to take a look.

624
00:46:07,905 --> 00:46:09,223
That hurts.

625
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,291
I saw you to be a meticulous person.

626
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:15,379
When I'm wearing a gown, I seem
like that, right?

627
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,255
You're here to buy property?

628
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,255
I just came to look.

629
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:22,697
What's your expert opinion on this
apartment?

630
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:24,697
It's pretty nice.

631
00:46:24,794 --> 00:46:26,108
Subdivided apartments are nice,

632
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:28,850
but if you're buying it as an investment,
apartments that aren't are better.

633
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:31,600
I don't know much about investments
and such.

634
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:34,294
Now that I'm here,

635
00:46:34,452 --> 00:46:37,214
to be honest, I'm really confused.

636
00:46:37,376 --> 00:46:39,641
When I look at the people getting
consultations,

637
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:43,338
all are either couples or with parents.

638
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:52,779
If I live alone among all those families,
I think I might be more lonely.

639
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:55,714
You don't plan on marrying?

640
00:46:56,055 --> 00:46:58,014
No, that's not it.

641
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:04,250
Since I'm at this age, planning all the
possibilities would lessen the shock.

642
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,950
I learned.

643
00:47:06,602 --> 00:47:10,885
You must be thinking "if there's no right
person, I just won't get married".

644
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:15,247
Single people our age usually
think that, right?

645
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:19,973
Since you say you're in the market for
real estate, I should make business of it.

646
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,344
After you see a well-built house, you'll
probably wonder why anyone would buy a house.

647
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,167
This is our Director Jo's work.

648
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,167
Oh, really?

649
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:39,861
The houses are really bright and have
an open feel, so they're unique.

650
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:47,514
If you look at his personality, you imagine a
windowless, door-less concrete house, right?

651
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:52,229
He has very good penmanship.

652
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:56,561
All these houses were built by you two?

653
00:47:56,638 --> 00:47:59,691
Jae Hee does the creating, and I do
the homemaking.

654
00:48:02,405 --> 00:48:03,747
What?

655
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,744
So he can do as much as he can,
I set the dinner table,

656
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,794
and when he causes trouble,
I wash the dishes.

657
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:14,732
Oh, I heard from Hyun Kyu.

658
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:19,132
Jo Jae Hee causes the trouble, and
apologizing is always your duty.

659
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,605
You even know Hyun Kyu?

660
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:22,605
Yes, it just happened.

661
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,297
What can I do, but apologize?

662
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,211
He seems determined to go to his grave
without saying "thank you" or "sorry".

663
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:40,200
Welcome.

664
00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:45,838
<i>You're by yourself, right?</i>

665
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,202
I can't be alone?

666
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,429
<i>No, not at all.</i>

667
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,429
<i>What will you have?</i>

668
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:54,867
Give me a macara. Single.

669
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:56,758
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

670
00:48:57,526 --> 00:48:59,505
I have a gift for you.

671
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,505
A g ift?

672
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:08,535
I'll put it on for you.

673
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:18,044
It's so pretty.

674
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:20,044
Is it okay for me to accept this?

675
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,208
The jewel definitely has a owner.

676
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:27,870
I'll go look in the mirror.

677
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:49,258
By any chance, do you know me?

678
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:53,164
Yes.

679
00:49:54,373 --> 00:49:55,835
No.

680
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:03,761
Hey, you're probably mocking me now for
trying to seduce a woman with money, right?

681
00:50:03,797 --> 00:50:05,761
<i>Why would you say something like that?</i>

682
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:10,100
If you think about it, buying a woman's
affection with money

683
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:13,923
isn't it the best way to spend that money?

684
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:20,208
It's really pretty.

685
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:24,317
Soo Yeon, should we go to the suburbs
next time?

686
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:26,870
I'll give you a tour of the house I built.

687
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,870
Really?

688
00:50:31,235 --> 00:50:32,597
Give me another Macara.

689
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:33,535
Double.

690
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:34,521
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

691
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:45,517
"Wild Stallion"

692
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:48,247
So this is the place.

693
00:50:48,391 --> 00:50:50,444
The entrance is strange.

694
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:52,785
What the?

695
00:51:06,655 --> 00:51:08,864
That little...

696
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:14,044
The next patient.

697
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:19,941
Welcome.

698
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:29,397
Have a seat.

699
00:51:35,032 --> 00:51:36,608
Where are you unwell?

700
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,064
My stomach...

701
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,013
Your stomach is?

702
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:44,942
It's different than usual.

703
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,139
Did you drink yesterday?

704
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,917
How much did you have to drink?

705
00:52:03,676 --> 00:52:05,264
A bit.

706
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:09,091
You only had a bit, but you still smell
like it in the morning?

707
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,611
I had whiskey on the rocks,
about 4-5 glasses.

708
00:52:12,658 --> 00:52:14,611
I drank doubles.

709
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:15,827
It's a hangover.

710
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,611
I guess that's a possibility.

711
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:20,611
I'll give you a prescription.

712
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:23,697
What if it's something else?

713
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:27,664
I think there are many sides to people.

714
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,644
I don't know much about architecture,
but I think you're a very good architect.

715
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:37,835
Your works were really warm.

716
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:42,317
You draw well and have nice penmanship.

717
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:47,995
I saw Yun Ki Ran yesterday.

718
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:51,200
Why are the two of you meeting?

719
00:52:51,244 --> 00:52:54,619
I also heard that you redid a design
to save on the budget.

720
00:52:55,794 --> 00:52:58,535
Why is she talking about that for no reason.

721
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,052
She said that with the money you saved,

722
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,952
you were putting in a special bed for
a patient, so I gave her a referral.

723
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:08,073
I heard that that family has a mother who's
paralyzed from a brain condition.

724
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,730
You really did a good job.

725
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:31,870
The way you smile is...

726
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:34,611
What?

727
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,429
Did you...

728
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:43,726
ever work in a charity group or in
some weird religious group?

729
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,457
Like grabbing people on the street preaching

730
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,961
or going to the mountaintop to
meditate and sing.

731
00:53:51,697 --> 00:53:53,650
You can go now.

732
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:04,808
You are here? I finished the model,
take a look.

733
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,314
About Yu Jin

734
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:17,314
Yu Jin?

735
00:54:17,576 --> 00:54:19,314
Your neighbor

736
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:25,373
I feel really sorry for her.

737
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:27,938
She's working an extra part-time job to pay for the car repair fees.

738
00:54:27,955 --> 00:54:29,938
She says she only sleeps 3 hours a day.

739
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:32,456
Because she's dozing off and making
mistakes at work,

740
00:54:32,457 --> 00:54:34,628
she's terrified she's going to get fired.

741
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:37,505
What kind of part-time job is it?

742
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:39,505
She won't tell me.

743
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:53,767
Director,

744
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,370
don't you think you're being too mean?

745
00:54:57,235 --> 00:54:59,817
W... why is it my fault?

746
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:03,329
The reason you can drink, smoke, and drive
when you come to age

747
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,117
is to take responsibility for your
own actions.

748
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:09,132
But for 4.5 millions won,

749
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:11,731
there was no reason to tell on her
so enthusiastically.

750
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:14,732
How much?

751
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,335
For you that may only be the price
of an audio amp,

752
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:22,421
but to us poor young people, that money
can ruin our lives, you know.

753
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:35,838
One room was an office.

754
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:37,485
Another was a meeting room.

755
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:39,150
And another was a hospital.

756
00:55:39,194 --> 00:55:41,579
They had it set up by different concepts.

757
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:45,341
Are all 'room salons' set up like that
these days?

758
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,020
Hey, you should have taken me too.

759
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:51,047
Hey, what's good that I take you along?

760
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:57,067
Hey, did men do weird things?

761
00:55:57,129 --> 00:55:59,352
According to that woman,

762
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:04,129
if a man makes unwanted advances,
he gets kicked out and can't return.

763
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,426
And they still make that much?

764
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:09,141
She says they actually make more money
that way.

765
00:56:09,185 --> 00:56:11,467
She said that a man's wallet is open
the widest

766
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,523
when he hasn't been fulfilled yet or
something like that.

767
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:19,005
That's perfect for women in need of money.

768
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:22,014
All you have to do is sit there with
them for a few days.

769
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,785
She tried to talk me into it.

770
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:27,904
She did, right? I thought it was weird
to bring the repair fees to her store.

771
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:30,817
Crazy! What does she take me for?

772
00:56:30,835 --> 00:56:32,300
Let's just suffer for 3 months!

773
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:38,300
Can you ask your sister if I'm amazing
at sales, if she can give me a bonus?

774
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,701
Understood. I'll make sure to put in a
good word for you about the bonus.

775
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:43,197
Okay.

776
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:27,312
Hello.

777
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:30,374
I'm late again.

778
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:54,011
I think there's something wrong with
my stomach.

779
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,298
It's definitely a hangover again.

780
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:01,770
Do you have a problem?

781
00:59:06,158 --> 00:59:07,647
We have to

782
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:12,591
satisfy all of them with 5 senses.

783
00:59:17,585 --> 00:59:19,155
Smell,

784
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:21,155
touch,

785
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:27,879
and please look at this.

786
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,705
Yu Jin...

787
00:59:32,938 --> 00:59:34,864
Yu Jin...

788
00:59:34,976 --> 00:59:37,094
<i>Yu Jin, wake up.</i>

789
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:39,002
<i>Wake up, Yu Jin.</i>

790
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:39,644
<i>Yu Jin...</i>

791
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:41,444
Why are you like this lately?

792
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,985
You doze off in front of an important buyer
I tell you to put up the meeting agenda,

793
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,823
but you put up a customer complaint.

794
00:59:50,314 --> 00:59:52,864
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

795
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,719
Call Tae Hyul.

796
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:06,682
Get your money from him right now!

797
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,641
His situation is obvious.

798
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,790
This isn't the time to consider other
people's situations.

799
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,144
Our evaluations are coming up soon.

800
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,144
Do you want to get fired.

801
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:19,635
No need for long conversation.

802
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:23,222
Just give him the account number and say
"give me the money". Coldly, okay?

803
01:00:25,973 --> 01:00:26,804
Hurry.

804
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:55,973
Are you living well?

805
01:00:57,411 --> 01:00:58,337
Yeah.

806
01:01:00,897 --> 01:01:02,297
Why did you want to see me?

807
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,138
Oppa,

808
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:07,217
give me back my money.

809
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:08,857
I really need the money right now.

810
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:14,882
That's why you wanted to see me?

811
01:01:21,664 --> 01:01:26,811
I didn't call you for a good reason, so
why did you wash your hair before coming?

812
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,982
Why did you put on cologne?

813
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:31,985
What were you expecting, you dummy?

814
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,051
Doctor.

815
01:01:57,852 --> 01:01:59,994
Yu Jin, your number was on my phone.

816
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,994
I had it on vibrate, so I didn't see it.

817
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:04,011
I just called.

818
01:02:04,408 --> 01:02:08,745
I was upset about something and
you came to mind.

819
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,363
What is it? I'll listen.

820
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,044
Tomorrow's an off day.
What are you doing?

821
01:02:15,091 --> 01:02:16,637
Do you want to come over?

822
01:02:16,752 --> 01:02:20,056
At my house, let's eat dinner and play
until we drop.

823
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:22,314
That sounds like a great offer.

824
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,335
Doctor!

825
01:03:07,635 --> 01:03:09,862
Ah, I couldn't even wash up!

826
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:22,638
You live over there.

827
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:23,818
I know.

828
01:03:27,023 --> 01:03:27,928
Come out.

829
01:03:34,255 --> 01:03:35,588
What is it?

830
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:37,764
I heard the repair bill is a lot.

831
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:39,100
What are you going to do?

832
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:42,020
What does that have anything to do with you?

833
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:58,194
I guess I'll need to take care of it
somehow with a part-time job.

834
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:01,592
You came to ask me about that?

835
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:07,900
What is this?

836
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,550
Why should I accept this?!

837
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,088
It's not being used anyway,
so you can use it.

838
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:23,400
It's fine. I'll take care of it myself.

839
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,795
It's because I'm uncomfortable.

840
01:04:28,767 --> 01:04:34,306
I hate making others uncomfortable and
I hate that others are inconvenienced by me.

841
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,288
If it's something that can be solved
with money, it's very easy.

842
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:39,994
It's simple.

843
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:42,033
But this is...

844
01:04:44,623 --> 01:04:46,698
I saw you going to your part-time job.

845
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,614
You shouldn't do things like that.

846
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,142
There's nothing I can do.

847
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:01,814
Though it's a bit hard on my body.

848
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,102
If you were so tight on cash, shouldn't
you have sold the dog first?

849
01:05:06,197 --> 01:05:07,231
He looks expensive.

850
01:05:07,902 --> 01:05:09,020
What did you say?!

851
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,404
It's common sense.

852
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:12,347
Sanggu is family.

853
01:05:12,373 --> 01:05:14,079
How can you sell family?

854
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,172
Is that common sense to you?

855
01:05:16,814 --> 01:05:17,754
Then,

856
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,364
doing that kind of business with male
clients is common sense?

857
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:23,094
What's wrong with doing business with
male customers?

858
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:27,705
That's enough? Just use that for now.

859
01:05:28,411 --> 01:05:31,164
I don't think I deserve to be sneered
at like that.

860
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,922
I don't want this.

861
01:05:33,326 --> 01:05:35,164
It's better than working at a place
like that.

862
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:37,789
What's wrong with selling clothes?

863
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:40,912
You sell clothes too?

864
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:43,968
What else do I sell?

865
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:47,680
You sell alcohol also.

866
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:49,840
What did you say?!

867
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,440
I heard it was a secret part-time job.

868
01:05:53,564 --> 01:05:57,350
Seriously!
You're really a ridiculous person!

869
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:02,651
Ahjusshi!

870
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,502
Do I look that pathetic to you?

871
01:06:06,002 --> 01:06:08,200
Money doesn't seem like anything to you,

872
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,821
but I'm scared to death because of it!

873
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:17,034
The company is always threatening to
fire me, but I can't get a loan.

874
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:23,050
When I see girls having fun buying clothes,
I get angry, wondering why I'm like this.

875
01:06:24,302 --> 01:06:27,522
I want to rob others.

876
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:29,274
I really need money right now.

877
01:06:30,823 --> 01:06:31,737
But,

878
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:33,654
what did you say?

879
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:36,382
You're asking if I work at a bar?

880
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:40,290
Who are you to look down on me?

881
01:06:40,426 --> 01:06:42,246
Do I look easy to you?

882
01:06:43,694 --> 01:06:47,420
You don't even know how well I'm living.

889
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:34,567
Why is it that when you're around,
it's always like this?

890
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,452
Why are you bothering me on my day off?

891
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:38,452
I should have gone to the hospital to work.

892
01:07:38,476 --> 01:07:40,602
I'm crazy. Why did I get on that bus?

893
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:42,602
Dog-napper!

894
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:43,838
He's your ex, right?

895
01:07:43,879 --> 01:07:46,347
That's embarrassing.
Why are you running with a dog?

896
01:07:46,408 --> 01:07:47,164
Leave.

897
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,376
Are you playing with me right now?

898
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:50,720
Jae Hee, do you want to watch a
play with me?

899
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:53,288
It took 8 years to get this close to you.

900
01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:58,067
The client I talked to just now is sending us
tickets to watch the fireworks festival.

901
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,917
Boss, you're really not going?

902
01:07:59,964 --> 01:08:02,414
You know there's a fireworks
festival, right?

903
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:04,414
Are you by any chance

904
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,394
asking me to go watch it with you?
