3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,569
I like you, Jo Jae Hee.

4
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:28,238
<i>that I just fall down awkwardly, and only make people hurt.</i>

5
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:33,107
<i>I've been grazed and getting weary of love.</i>

6
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:36,206
<i>Those lonely days.</i>

7
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,876
<i>Love was hard.</i>

8
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,166
<i>Even with practice, it wasn't working.</i>

9
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:50,829
<i>Even awkward me, even late me, will you love me?</i>

10
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:54,571
<i>It must be love.</i>

11
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,577
<i>It's love. Look at me.</i>

12
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,416
<i>Even if I close my eyes,</i>

13
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,245
<i>I can see you.</i>

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,452
<i>Because inside me, you're there,</i>

15
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:14,365
<i>because I can love you</i>

16
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:19,731
<i>because you stayed in my heart,</i>

17
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:23,914
<i>I'm not lonely anymore.</i>

18
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:36,018
<i>My heart, that once was so dark,</i>

19
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:40,324
<i>has a candle lit in your direction.</i>

20
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,259
<i>That clumsy heart</i>

21
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:46,835
<i>flew up to the sky that miraculous day.</i>

22
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:50,433
<i>It must be love.</i>

23
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:54,801
<i>It's love. Look at me.</i>

24
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,406
<i>Even if I close my eyes,</i>

25
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,402
<i>I can see you.</i>

26
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:06,501
<i>Because inside me, you're there,</i>

27
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,432
<i>because I can love you</i>

28
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:15,629
<i>because you stayed in my heart,</i>

29
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:20,041
<i>I'm not lonely anymore.</i>

30
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:24,303
<i>You are amazing,</i>

31
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,955
<i>more than anyone in the world.</i>

32
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,507
<i>Your loving and caring heart</i>

33
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:37,036
<i>has taught me too.</i>

34
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:41,618
<i>Your loving and caring heart</i>

35
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:45,801
<i>has taught me too.</i>

36
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,191
Episode 12
"Is okay to be troubled?"

37
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,229
Please have a sit.

38
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,362
You don't look too good.

39
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,426
I worked on the design late into the night.

40
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,855
Is that so?

41
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:43,973
I was picturing the house that..

42
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:48,474
I will live in with a certain someone.

43
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,622
With a certain someone?

44
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:09,456
Until now I've been designing
other people's houses.

45
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:15,200
I really want to design a house that...

46
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,801
I will live in together with
the people I love.

47
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,320
It's really... a little difficult.

48
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,547
That... isn't really good to work on.

49
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,351
It's still very frustrating,

50
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,872
and there's nothing good about it.

51
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,155
It's more comfortable to live alone.

52
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:47,300
Marrying, is like that.

53
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:54,156
But then, I met you.

54
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:58,680
Seeing to talking to people,

55
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:04,339
hanging out with the
people who understand me,

56
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,613
I feel it isn't bad either.

57
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,186
So...

58
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,222
So...

59
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,940
I, too...

60
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,764
like you Dr. Jang.

61
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,298
I think...

62
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,840
I've liked you from the start.

63
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,920
Maybe... marriage isn't too possible,

64
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,487
but after meeting you...

65
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,218
Wait a second.

66
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,274
Yes?

67
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:35,175
Wh.. what did you just say?

68
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,730
After meeting you...

69
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,992
Before that.

70
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:43,124
I can't marry.

71
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,821
Right now I can't understand
what you're saying.

72
00:08:57,674 --> 00:09:02,822
Didn’t you say you thought
about marriage after meeting me?

73
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,170
Yes, I thought so before.

74
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,239
But if I were to really design a
house to live in with you...

75
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,640
it won't go too well.

76
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:19,687
Haven't I made myself clear just now?

77
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,928
I'm lost for words.

78
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:22,984
Huh?

79
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,043
Who said they wanted to marry?

80
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,443
Why are you drawing a house
to live in with me all of a sudden?

81
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:31,222
No... but Dr. Jang wants to get married,

82
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,741
and if I also like Dr. Jang...

83
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35,442
then we have to carefully
consider every aspect.

84
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:39,591
So then, you do like me...

85
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,064
but we just can't marry?

86
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:46,194
Just because...
you can't draw up a house we will live in?

87
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,810
Yes.

88
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,454
The house, I don't need it.

89
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:54,381
Huh?

90
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:57,942
Houses and all those, what does
it matter if it's paid annually or monthly?

91
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,794
That can't be done.

92
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:03,929
If I can't draw up or picture in
my mind a world with just the two of us,

93
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,674
then I can't marry!

94
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,053
This is a problem.

95
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,164
Huh? This person is seriously...

96
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,998
someone who only understands himself.

97
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:15,131
No... until now...

98
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:16,790
I don't need that anymore now.

99
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,689
Never again...
never again show your face in front of me.

100
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:28,697
Huh?

101
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,228
Houses and those things?

102
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,921
Pretending to understand me...

103
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,383
Oh! Doctor! What's wrong?

104
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:05,299
Can you let be alone for a while?

105
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,687
You've lived your entire
life like that haven't you?

106
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,909
Such a weird woman.

107
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,269
Don't walk so fast!

108
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,224
What are you doing?!

109
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:00,641
Huh?

110
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,645
Ahjussi are you crazy?!

111
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,787
Huh?

112
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:07,341
Didn't you just poke my butt!

113
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,636
That probably... was done by that kid.

114
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,578
Oh my ahjussi is really funny hey!
Why are you falsely accusing my child?

115
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,424
I'm also a victim.

116
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,945
Hey, aren't you owning up?

117
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:25,241
You brat... you brat!

118
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,180
What are you doing ahjussi?

119
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,518
No... you've got it wrong...

120
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,328
This kid... butt...

121
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,107
Ahjussi! You're really...!

122
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,572
Ahjussi?

123
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,221
It's not me.

124
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:56,044
Yes, yes... We'll know after
we've done our investigations,

125
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:57,401
so let's go.

126
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,954
Hey hey look here,
please let me explain myself...

127
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:01,087
Ahjussi, what's wrong?

128
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,659
What's happening?

129
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,288
Thank god you're here. Let it to them.

130
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,851
Am I the kind of person who
will poke people's butts on the streets?

131
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,027
Huh?

132
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:12,969
Hurry tell them!

133
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:17,063
Hurry hurry!

134
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:19,419
Aish this ahjussi is really insistent hey?

135
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,574
Hand me your identification card please?

136
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:25,806
I can't give you my identification card.
There's no reason to.

137
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:28,714
We have to investigate before
knowing whether you're innocent.

138
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,955
I've already said that
it was that child who did it,

139
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,432
why was he let go just like that?

140
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:37,193
This student is accusing you ahjussi.

141
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,382
Student! Ahjussi isn't that sort of person.

142
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:43,247
This ahjussi is a very famous architect.

143
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,868
Just because you're a famous
architect then everything's alright?

144
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:49,746
Do you know how unhappy
and embarrassed I was back then?

145
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,784
I'm being dragged here,
do you think I don't have any unhappiness?!

146
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:57,536
Ahjussi, we'll see when
my parents are here!

147
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:02,297
Let's write up a investigation
report first. Name?

148
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,301
It's Jo Jae Hee.

149
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,421
Age?

150
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,606
40 years old.

151
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,264
Stop talking!

152
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:10,665
Marital status?

153
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,322
Single. This ahjussi lives alone.

154
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,583
Really...

155
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:26,719
That work... is one which received
a Gold Award from the Royal Family.

156
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,650
Ahjussi, let me see your
identity card please.

157
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,236
I'm not saying you're that sort of person.

158
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,713
Sometimes a person can be strongly denying,

159
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,730
but after that he's revealed
to not be a first-time offender.

160
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,606
You're already 40, have no dependents,

161
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:45,730
and there's your appreciation
for adult entertainment.

162
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,327
We should do our job shouldn't we?

163
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,959
Being 40, single, without dependents,

164
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,846
if I walk on the streets,
then I'll poke a high school girl's butt?

165
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,713
I'm not saying that.

166
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,264
You're really weird!

167
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:03,409
You're speaking as though
he is some offender!

168
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,620
I've already said this
ahjussi isn't someone like that!

169
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:17,121
Just treat it like you've
simply stepped on dung.

170
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:26,803
Woa... I helped so much
and he doesn't even say thank you.

171
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,373
I discovered a room that's better
than I thought I would find.

172
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,849
Really? Look around for more.

173
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:41,124
After tomorrow there's no
more overtime so I'll accompany you.

174
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,752
Am I bothering you too much?

175
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:48,117
At first I said I'll go with Hyun Kyu,
because my job requires me to travel.

176
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,379
Not a bother at all.

177
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,029
Look for places near my small district.

178
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,002
When Yu Jin moves out, I'll be lonely.

179
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:57,531
Me too.

180
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,434
Mun Jung, over here!

181
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:06,961
Here.

182
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:07,909
Father.

183
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,223
Hello!

184
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,514
Why are you suddenly picking
up a musical instrument?

185
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,582
Because I see dad's learning very well.

186
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:20,511
I also want to find some zest in my life.

187
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,117
Go learn together with Mr. Jo.

188
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,188
Please give up your hope on Jo Jae Hee.

189
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:29,451
I've decided not to see him again.

190
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:31,435
Don't ask me anything.

191
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:35,356
Dad don't raise the topic
on Jo Jae Hee anymore.

192
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,876
No... wh... what...

193
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,341
Which should I learn?

194
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,658
Oh...! Jo Jae Hee,
Yun Ki Ran Architecture Firm.

195
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:14,113
So, then this was the condition
for your return?

196
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,583
Because of the strong emphasis...

197
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,284
about us being the perfect partner,
so they requested.

198
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:21,113
Then we should openly admit being partners.

199
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,033
If he doesn't change his legal
name then he won't come back, right?

200
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:38,771
Regardless, from today onwards
I've decided to be reborn.

201
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:44,493
40 years old,
what can you do even if you're reborn?

202
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,158
Let's begin the Sam Choon Dong meeting.

203
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:53,799
Tonight Hyun Kyu and I have to go to
down to Wando for a while.

204
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,767
I worried leaving him here alone.

205
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,767
What on earth did Jae Hee tell
that couple that they haven't even called?

206
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,740
I didn't do anything wrong alright.

207
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,878
No matter what I don't feel at peace.

208
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:16,304
Mum had your surgery,
so now I feel less worried.

209
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:19,815
Yea... I came back to life without any pain.

210
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,023
See I told you.
We can run with all our hearts now!

211
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:23,913
Yes.

212
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,781
- Omo...
- Hello!

213
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:29,034
Dr. Jung, I'm being discharged already.

214
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,402
It's been hard on you.
Take care of yourself.

215
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,944
All the time I've been in the hospital,

216
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:38,197
you've put in much effort., thank you.

217
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,580
I didn't do anything special either...

218
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,627
Because of us, you've also had a tough time.

219
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:47,751
You have to come visit
our home alright? Hmm?

220
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,176
Then, please go well.

221
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,363
What's wrong?

222
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,917
What's with the atmosphere?

223
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,218
For this house,
the price is well worth it right?

224
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:28,062
That's true, but the alley
is a little scary.

225
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:31,035
Yu Jin, don't be like this, stay in with me.

226
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:34,028
My house has so many rooms.

227
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:36,355
I shouldn't trouble you.

228
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:39,694
I'll just have to look for more houses.
One more to view then come over to my house.

229
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:41,934
Come for a meal how about that?

230
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,994
Let's just eat out.

231
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,087
You're weird...

232
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:50,297
Why aren't you coming to my house recently?

233
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,144
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

234
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:07,948
Doctor...

235
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,415
Omo who is it?

236
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,132
Yu Jin, Yu Jin.

237
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:44,705
Come here.

238
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,613
Here, here.

239
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:00,976
Ahjussi...

240
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:05,414
the guy who stalked me on the public bus,

241
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,202
do you remember him?

242
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,690
Does it look like him?

243
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,119
Back then you saw him,
did you see him again after that?

244
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:27,096
I never saw him again, but I can't
think of anyone else other than that person.

245
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,090
How would that person know
your handphone number?

246
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,918
If he set his mind to it,
why couldn't he find out?

247
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,753
To look for a house,
she posted her number on the web.

248
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:40,351
I have to look for a house, what can I do?

249
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,025
Hyun Kyu isn't here either,
what should you do after work?

250
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,718
Ahjussi, can you leave work
together with me these few days?

251
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,761
Huh?

252
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:06,214
The high school girl incident,
I helped you quite a bit.

253
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,050
This ahjussi, on the streets...

254
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,451
was accused to have poked a
high school girl's butt.

255
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,323
I helped him when he was
taken to the police station.

256
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:14,831
703!

257
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,760
It wasn't me.

258
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,513
You owe Yu Jin, so you should help her once.

259
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:30,012
While Hyun Kyu is away, if Jo Jae Hee,
at least, went around with her...

260
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:32,213
don't you think it would be a
little less scary for her?

261
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,731
Even Mr. Jo Jae Hee?

262
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:36,497
The office is nearby too.

263
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,088
It's troublesome.

264
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,393
It can't be more troublesome
than marriage right?

265
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:43,926
It's such a troublesome matter,
how can you breathe?

266
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,140
Just for a few days,
before Hyun Kyu returns.

267
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,027
It was the same with Sanggu.

268
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,826
Have you already forgotten
that kind of hardship?

269
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:02,045
With a few experiences of being exhausted,

270
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,578
Mr. Jo Jae Hee will also
become a real person.

271
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:10,570
Did you two quarrel again?

272
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,909
I'll leave it in your hands.

273
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:25,145
Yu Jin, sleep well, don't worry alright?

274
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,204
Get home safely.

275
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,456
Dr. jang...

276
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:40,971
You were also in the sent picture.

277
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:44,010
Why aren't you thinking it could be you?

278
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,927
Maybe Dr. Jang is the target.

279
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:49,633
The picture wasn't sent to me,
it was sent to Yu Jin's handphone.

280
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:25,723
What's with him....
saying weird things to make me afraid.

281
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,483
What are you doing?

282
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,465
Just walk.

283
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:39,780
Huh?

284
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:39,795
It's not a time for me to be in a daze.

285
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,738
What exactly is that man trying to do?

286
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,970
What did you say?

287
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,275
Can't build a house so he'll not marry?

288
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:54,786
Hey! Just buy a house!
Don't you guys have a lot of money?

289
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,704
It's not that.

290
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,652
You have so many things really.

291
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,517
He's not a normal guy
that you imagine in your mind.

292
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:05,106
During that time he kept advocating
to me his thoughts...

293
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,107
that he is this sort or that sort of person.

294
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,451
I disregarded everything he said.

295
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,632
Did he say he likes you?

296
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,107
Does he want to date you?

297
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,649
If it were that, then I think he might.

298
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,954
No, I don't even know what
will happen then...

299
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,216
he's doesn't even know where to jump.

300
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:25,747
He isn't even a grasshopper,
how can there be such a person?

301
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:27,073
Even if he's willing to go ahead...

302
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,274
at my age do you think I'll enter a
relationship with no future?

303
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:30,918
Unni you're really...

304
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:32,857
Yes,

305
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:35,765
there isn't much time left
for you to give birth.

306
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:37,854
Just give birth!

307
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:40,676
Not bearing a child,
do you know how regretful that is?

308
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:48,324
A man whom I confessed my feelings to...

309
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:53,780
but concludes he can't get married,
can't make it right?

310
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:57,054
You first confessed and
now you're having this attitude?

311
00:27:57,174 --> 00:28:01,739
My gosh! You're so disappointing!

312
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:05,116
Hey! Forget about it! Forget it!

313
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,757
Getting all agitated again.

314
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:13,936
Instead of saying it's a disappointment,
see it as sincerity.

315
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:16,801
That person seem to like living alone.

316
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:20,236
Hey! Forget it forget it!

317
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:13,712
Hey, could it be that guy?

318
00:30:13,832 --> 00:30:17,642
That one from the meeting,
he keeps in touch with you, right?

319
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,205
That guy?

320
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,323
See.

321
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,089
Oh, what's this?

322
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:27,826
<i>My boss is dead.</i>

323
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,300
<i>When I played dodge ball at lunchtime,
I stepped on “gold*”. (*dog poo?)</i>

324
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,639
How could this kind of guy
do such scary things?

325
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,189
And he doesn't call me anymore.
I called him and scolded him upside down.

326
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:45,110
Hey, can it be he can't get
over it and ended up doing this to you?

327
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,914
Maybe he's so busy crafting humor
that he has no time to bother with this.

328
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,887
It's all your fault I'm can't live properly.

329
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,472
I shouldn't have gone to that meeting.

330
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:01,296
That Ahjussi....

331
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:06,186
That ahjussi can't be the criminal, can he?

332
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,262
Ahjussi,

333
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,157
I'm very thankful that you're
sending me home.

334
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:14,164
This is so embarrassing,
can't we talk as we walk?

335
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,167
You want me to send you home...

336
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,468
now you want me to provide
conversation service too?

337
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:26,646
What's that?

338
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,346
This?

339
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:34,085
A 1945 Baton Rachir.

340
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:37,466
It's one of the limited
15 bottles imported into Korea.

341
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:45,480
Ahjussi, it seems a part of your
life has stopped in the growing up stages.

342
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,514
What?

343
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,840
How is it you display such
child-like expressions?

344
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,296
After all, you're already a
man in his forties.

345
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:52,869
What expression?

346
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:58,759
When you speak with those expressions,
it's really sickening, you know.

347
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:05,050
What? What? Why? Why?

348
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:09,216
I'm sure it was this kid.

349
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:10,336
What?

350
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,577
The kid who wedged my butt.

351
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,147
What was that all about, ahjussi?

352
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:22,077
There'll come a day we'll meet again.

353
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,747
What were you thinking?
Putting up your contact number on the web?

354
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:43,840
The root cause is that you're
too lacking in caution towards others.

355
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,066
If you treat others with
caution all the time,

356
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:48,328
then I'll become just like you,
isn't that right?

357
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:49,362
You!

358
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:14,008
Ahjussi, you get along so well with Sanggu,

359
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:17,183
why do you always quarrel with other people?

360
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,876
Dogs don't talk, right?

361
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:21,729
They can communicate, you know.

362
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,323
I'll show you.

363
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:27,566
Sanggu, down! Down!

364
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:31,896
You call that communication?

365
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,059
I'm sure you haven't seen this one yet.

366
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,906
Sanggu, down, bang!

367
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:44,468
Bang!

368
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:52,237
Bang! Bang!

369
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:55,942
Kiddo!

370
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:03,729
Ahjussi, you and Sanggu seem
to have telepathy.

371
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:07,025
Cute lady!

372
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,796
Such a cute lady!

373
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:16,416
Ahgassi, how old are you?

374
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,355
What do you think you're doing?

375
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:21,539
I say, you....make.....way.

376
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:28,088
- Ahgassi.
- Stop that.

377
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:33,000
- You hit me?
- So what if I did?

378
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,959
Jerk, how dare you hit me?

379
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:54,453
Anyhow, you always bring trouble to others.

380
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:56,521
I'm sorry.

381
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,063
I've lived for 40 years,

382
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:01,282
but it's my first time
facing a situation like this.

383
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,949
Ahjussi, it's because you've
never dated before, that's why.

384
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,396
Alright, you may go.

385
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:14,097
Ah!

386
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,199
This lady here is being stalked.

387
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,698
Please activate phone-tracking on her.

388
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:24,603
What kind of harassment are you facing?

389
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:32,208
I receive this kind of messages.

390
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,625
Is that all?

391
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:39,521
You're asking if that's all?

392
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,193
Then what other harassment is necessary?

393
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:44,913
Please go ahead to file a suit.

394
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,003
What is that?

395
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,868
So you mean we'll have
to wait for court proceedings?

396
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:52,518
Once the court rules that
this is a crime of stalking,

397
00:36:52,638 --> 00:36:54,630
then we can start phone-tracking.

398
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,271
But what if something
happens before that, then what?

399
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,361
That is the regulation.

400
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,580
Does that regulation make any sense?

401
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,433
I can't do anything....

402
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:07,444
But if the regulation is not
sensible then it's got to be changed.

403
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:11,107
The people's police force
should protect the people, right?

404
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,843
Oh, sorry.

405
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:41,827
Oh, Yu Jin.

406
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,877
Ahjussi sent me home safely.

407
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:48,731
You didn't get any of those
harassing messages again, did you?

408
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:53,040
Yes, we made a report at the
police station too.

409
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,807
Really?

410
00:37:55,798 --> 00:38:01,035
Doctor, about the ahjussi,
it's so surprising.

411
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,168
What is?

412
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:06,077
Just now I saw him reasoning
out with the policeman,

413
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,425
I suddenly found him so dependable.

414
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:11,572
Is that so?

415
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:12,693
Yes.

416
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,186
Lock up properly before you sleep.

417
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,649
Yes, good night.

418
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:22,760
Sleep well, Yu Jin.

419
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:38,038
Hey, Yu Jin.

420
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:39,468
Yes, where are you?

421
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,902
I'm still at Wando.

422
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:44,703
But I can only work if my heart's at ease.

423
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,544
Why must such things happen
exactly when I'm away?

424
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,763
You must keep the alarm
with you at all times,

425
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:56,662
and you must contact me as soon
as you receive those message again.

426
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,717
Hyun Kyu, when will you be back?

427
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:04,100
I think I have to stay for another two days.

428
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,707
I'm really sorry, Yu Jin.

429
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:10,128
Yu Jin....

430
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,971
It's because of work, it can't be helped.

431
00:39:13,424 --> 00:39:16,348
Once I get back,
I will surely stay by your side.

432
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:19,127
Just let my boss protect you
for the time being.

433
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,247
Alright.

434
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,014
Yes, sleep well.

435
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,457
Alright.

436
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,052
703?

437
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,459
You got off work already?

438
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:07,928
Yes, ahjussi.

439
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,976
But I'm working overtime today.

440
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,103
Today, I've contacted my boss already.

441
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,473
You don't have to come over.

442
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,739
But you still have to walk the dog, right?

443
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,958
Ah, Sanggu.

444
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:26,438
Alright, I'll call you when I get back.

445
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,773
Bye.

446
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,113
You...that sounded like setting up a date.

447
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,188
It does sound like creating
a misunderstanding.

448
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,497
Is that Dr. jang?

449
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,204
You're so lacking in discernment,
he didn't use polite terms just now.

450
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,310
You two are close enough
not to use polite terms already?

451
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,132
No, it's not Dr. jang.

452
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,407
Then is it that colleague we saw?

453
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,292
Don't bother.

454
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:19,295
It's a dog owner.

455
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:22,251
He mentioned about walking
the dog, didn't he?

456
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:26,409
So it's because of this girl,
you quarreled with Dr. jang?

457
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,541
Uncle,

458
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:30,502
are you going on a date?

459
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:31,799
No.

460
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,514
Hey, who is it?

461
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:39,469
For me, it's alright even
if it's not Dr. jang.

462
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,403
Mum!

463
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,430
Yes, yes, of course.

464
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,921
Let's arrange a meeting soon.

465
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:57,778
Have a good trip. You're welcome.

466
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,499
Bye!

467
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:05,838
The Samshin-dong client...resolved.

468
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,326
The one who got mad at Director?

469
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,114
How did you do it?

470
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:13,936
I gave away Jae Hee's Jeju island
travel voucher to the lady.

471
00:42:14,056 --> 00:42:16,349
Maybe it's because the husband
forgot about the wedding anniversary,

472
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,525
that's why the wife became extra-sensitive.

473
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:21,153
The husband then annoyed
the wife unknowingly.

474
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:24,180
But it didn't sound like
they were fighting about that.

475
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,946
The wife.....

476
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:29,569
you guys really don't know women.

477
00:42:29,689 --> 00:42:33,339
Jae Hee has the instincts to design
the best architecture with the best style,

478
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:35,747
and you're still far off from him,

479
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:37,772
but you should research on people first.

480
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:40,443
Only then can you build
houses that people live in.

481
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,276
Why are you lecturing me so bluntly?

482
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:48,800
These are the inspection results.

483
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:05,995
Manager,
did you really dump Mun Seok Hwan?

484
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:14,430
With your instincts,
you can't even build a small dog house.

485
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:16,949
Too much.

486
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,901
I really like Jae Hee.

487
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:21,905
What? What!

488
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,642
Oh, I feel relieved.

489
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:30,434
How is it you guys have no sense?

490
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:35,187
Manager, you said you like Director?

491
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:39,323
Why did you say such a ridiculous thing?

492
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:44,676
When we're done with work,
how about we go for a drink?

493
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,606
Seems like it's for real.

494
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:52,432
Well, drinks....but make sure you don't cry.

495
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:58,352
What should I do? My tears are falling.

496
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:04,276
Hey...

497
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,014
do you think I should just
give it a good cry before we go?

498
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:12,892
You stay here with me.

499
00:44:13,012 --> 00:44:15,269
You can't do that.

500
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,415
Don't cry, please.

501
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:20,591
Got it.

502
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:24,046
Really.

503
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:31,689
Thank you.

504
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,059
<i>This man doesn't fit you.</i>

505
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,515
<i>I'm the only one who fits you.</i>

506
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:05,422
What's this?

507
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,639
<i>We will be meeting real soon.</i>

508
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:31,065
Have you found out who it is?

509
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:33,564
2 days ago, he sent some photos.

510
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:36,289
When I was looking at them,
I remembered something.

511
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:38,422
What did you remember?

512
00:45:51,092 --> 00:45:52,450
What's this?

513
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:56,227
2 weeks ago, I went to Family World
with Soo Young.

514
00:45:56,347 --> 00:45:57,628
Family World?!

515
00:45:57,748 --> 00:45:59,287
Ah That's right.

516
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:00,967
You lost your handphone then, right?

517
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:03,121
Yes, you remember that too?

518
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:21,569
Hey, my handphone is gone!

519
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,718
Where did it go?

520
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:29,354
Thank you.

521
00:46:29,474 --> 00:46:31,056
That's great.

522
00:46:31,176 --> 00:46:33,792
Shall we take a photo together?

523
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:41,820
1....2.....3.

524
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:48,237
That day, I dropped my
handphone in the Haunted House.

525
00:46:48,357 --> 00:46:50,392
I went back there and looked for hours,

526
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:54,420
then I found the Mummy holding my handphone.

527
00:46:55,821 --> 00:46:58,109
What did he look like?

528
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,664
The bandages were all around him,
I couldn't see his face.

529
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:03,409
Should we report to the police?

530
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,213
If it's only our suspicion,
the police won't act on it.

531
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,669
We have to get proof.

532
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,737
How about I make a trip there?

533
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:12,159
You, Doctor?

534
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,412
Since I'm free anyway, I'll go.

535
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,028
Not by yourself.

536
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:19,630
When I finish work, we'll go together.

537
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,354
It's still day time, it's alright.

538
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:22,905
I'll take a look and be right back.

539
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:26,374
I'll check if that guy was at the
Haunted House yesterday and the day before,

540
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:27,937
whether he reported for
work or not, that's all.

541
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:30,070
Right? Right?

542
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:54,083
It's not time for you to get
off work yet, is it?

543
00:47:54,203 --> 00:48:00,007
Ahjussi, Dr. jang went on her
own to check out that harassment suspect.

544
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,036
Suspect?

545
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:07,086
She went by herself to
Family World to see the suspect,

546
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:09,658
I keep worrying that she might be in danger.

547
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:13,751
Maybe, ahjussi, if you have the time,

548
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:17,779
This woman is really....

549
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,130
Mr. Jo Jae Hee, why are you here?

550
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,556
Why are you messing with
other people's business?

551
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:52,797
It concerns Yu Jin, you know.

552
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,004
You two should just get married.

553
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:02,279
Why did you come all the way
here to make trouble?

554
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,227
I got a shock.

555
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:28,804
<i>Welcome all passengers,
to the Haunted House.</i>

556
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:33,873
<i>You will see all kinds of evil
spirits from hell,</i>

557
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:36,340
<i>we hope you will have an...</i>

558
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:41,241
<i>unforgettable time here with us.</i>

559
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,598
<i>- Does it always shake like this?
- If any of you have done wrong things.....</i>

560
00:49:45,718 --> 00:49:49,347
<i>you will face the judgment of hell in here.</i>

561
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:55,207
<i>You go first.</i>

562
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:57,082
You go first, please.

563
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,430
- But...
- Please.

564
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:10,389
<i>- Come nearer.
- Oh really.</i>

565
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:19,376
<i>You jerk.</i>

566
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:24,676
<i>Go! We got frightened twice already.</i>

567
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:31,505
<i>Who are we looking for again?</i>

568
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,487
<i>The Mummy.</i>

569
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,916
<i>Mummy.</i>

570
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,492
<i>Mummy.</i>

571
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:54,517
<i>We're here in hell.</i>

572
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:02,302
<i>Earlier, those were yama* ghosts.
(*sent to bring the one who just died to hell)</i>

573
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:03,679
What?

574
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,381
Those without children, when they die,

575
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,984
they can't bear the loneliness
and the grievances,

576
00:51:08,104 --> 00:51:12,810
so they come to haunt others
with their loneliness and resentment.

577
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:15,503
Just like someone I know.

578
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:20,496
Ghost stories like this,
were crafted to get people married.

579
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:23,771
Bachelor ghosts, virgin ghosts,
hanging ghosts,

580
00:51:23,891 --> 00:51:27,314
those who aren't married
will suffer and be ill-at-ease,

581
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:29,512
do you know why that happens?

582
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,002
Ah!
That....

583
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:36,083
That's the one,
I think it's him, let's get him, quick.

584
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:37,677
Mr. Mummy!

585
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:42,346
Telephone number?

586
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,232
I just handed back the handphone
to the owner, that's all.

587
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:50,490
Have we met somewhere before?

588
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:51,847
What?

589
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,273
You...

590
00:51:56,315 --> 00:52:00,516
Ahjussi, ahjussi, ahjussi.

591
00:52:00,636 --> 00:52:03,489
Behind, there's a weird fella behind me.

592
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:09,626
Bus.

593
00:52:13,116 --> 00:52:14,258
Bus?

594
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,025
The guy who stalked Yu Jin?

595
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:18,942
What are you saying?

596
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:21,872
Remove those bandages.

597
00:52:21,992 --> 00:52:23,337
I won't.

598
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:25,168
You!

599
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:31,831
Check it out, quick.

600
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,567
What are you doing?

601
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,624
You were on that bus!

602
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:38,843
Hey, I don't know what you're talking about.

603
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:40,050
Is it him?

604
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,463
Come with me to the police station.

605
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,112
If it's him, let's call the
police now, quick.

606
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:47,529
If the police finds that
I'm not the culprit...

607
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,030
how will you be responsible?

608
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:53,074
But you guys are too ridiculous.

609
00:52:53,194 --> 00:52:55,464
Just because I do this kind of work here,
you look down on me?

610
00:52:55,584 --> 00:53:00,139
What's up? Why? Did something happened?

611
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:04,167
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

612
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:07,958
Where were you last night?

613
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:10,549
Of course, I was working here.

614
00:53:10,669 --> 00:53:12,832
Yes, he was here yesterday.

615
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:15,051
Let me see your job time card.

616
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:18,283
Time card? What a joke! Are you joking?

617
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,299
Why do you have to see the job time card?

618
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,313
I'm sure that's the guy.

619
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:34,414
Many people saw him at work
there last night.

620
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:36,956
So he has an alibi then?

621
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:39,003
What alibi?

622
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,545
What a coincidence!

623
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,907
If he's not the one then who else?

624
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:46,794
Is there anyone else suspicious?

625
00:53:52,301 --> 00:53:55,813
He's the one. That's it,
that's it, that's it..

626
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:58,592
that policeman!

627
00:54:02,513 --> 00:54:05,874
Every time 703's in trouble,
she goes to the police station, right?

628
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:10,786
How can it be the policeman?
That's ridiculous.

629
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:15,526
When ahjussi's butt was wedged,
he was grilled by that policeman.

630
00:54:15,646 --> 00:54:18,499
So I think he's been bearing the grudge.

631
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,190
In movies and dramas...

632
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:23,391
the most improbable person
is always the culprit.

633
00:54:23,713 --> 00:54:25,491
Security guard, police, friend...

634
00:54:25,492 --> 00:54:28,992
people who seemed trustworthy
turns out to do bad things.

635
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:32,034
Is this the time for jokes?

636
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:34,986
Jokes?

637
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:39,286
But who am I doing all this for?

638
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:43,271
From Sanggu to 703,

639
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,462
Dr. Jang, I'm not like you...

640
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:47,863
butting into other's affairs just
because you're lonely.

641
00:54:47,982 --> 00:54:50,814
I am a man with a busy work schedule.

642
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:54,045
- Ahjussi!
- What?

643
00:54:57,596 --> 00:54:58,931
Yes...

644
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:02,163
I'm so bored that I'm
butting into other's affairs.

645
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:05,158
If you're not happy, you should have
said you didn't want to do it.

646
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:07,369
Then, Dr. Jang...

647
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:08,769
Forget it...

648
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:12,087
today I'll send Yu Jin home.

649
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:15,038
We will never trouble you again,
Mr. Jo Jae Hee.

650
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:16,482
Alright?

651
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:19,060
Since we're done talking, you may go.

652
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:22,937
I'm telling you to leave it and go.

653
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:29,249
Do you have a discount card?

654
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,703
Do you have a member card?

655
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:43,247
It's 12, 000 won.

656
00:55:58,136 --> 00:56:01,109
<i>[Today] [Closed]
[Apologies]</i>

657
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:11,246
Is this place safe to rent?

658
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:14,392
Yes, since you said a
rooftop place is too dangerous,

659
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,524
this time round,
I chose a half-basement place.

660
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:20,810
Whether it's rooftop or half-basement,
it's still dangerous.

661
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:26,842
Excuse me....

662
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:30,855
Let's go, Yu Jin.

663
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,018
What?

664
00:56:32,729 --> 00:56:35,293
I found a decent place
so we're taking another look.

665
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:38,552
You don't have to explain these
things in detail to Mr. Jo Jae Hee.

666
00:56:38,919 --> 00:56:42,733
Two feeble ladies,
who's going to protect who?

667
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:52,738
Could it be a place with some problems?

668
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:56,401
I was told the owner had to go
overseas urgently hence he's renting it out.

669
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:59,448
And the facilities nearby
are all affordable,

670
00:56:59,568 --> 00:57:00,547
and no property fee too.

671
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,025
To me, this is like striking lottery.

672
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:05,351
Even so we must ensure there's
no problem with the place.

673
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:07,700
Let's have a look, if there's a problem,
you shouldn't rent it, understand?

674
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,121
Hey, what problem can there be?

675
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:18,847
<i>Who is it?</i>

676
00:57:19,493 --> 00:57:21,669
Is this the place for rent?

677
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,082
<i>Please come in.</i>

678
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:33,356
Isn't it too quiet?

679
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:34,648
It's alright.

680
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:36,436
Here.

681
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:58,873
It's cleaner than I imagined.

682
00:58:00,906 --> 00:58:03,168
Where is the owner?

683
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:18,911
This guy... the Mummy?

684
00:58:27,736 --> 00:58:29,739
Where did they go?

685
00:58:38,908 --> 00:58:42,312
You're here to look at the place,
right? Go ahead.

686
00:58:53,215 --> 00:58:54,508
Stay there.

687
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:56,356
What's wrong?

688
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:02,517
I haven't done anything.

689
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,348
Don't come over.

690
00:59:37,363 --> 00:59:38,354
Ahjussi!

691
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,077
You... you!

692
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:41,822
What?

693
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:44,127
You stinking Mummy.

694
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,011
703, are you alright?

695
01:00:14,713 --> 01:00:16,911
Jerk, you jerk!

696
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:21,025
If you dare harass 703 again,
I will... I will...

697
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,414
Ah, ahjussi, are you alright?

698
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,782
Manager, please send me to Yu Jin's house.

699
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:54,468
You're going to your girlfriend's house?

700
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:57,699
Of course, I have to see
her to set my heart at ease.

701
01:01:00,435 --> 01:01:02,827
Ahjussi, ahjussi!

702
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,541
Ahjussi, are you alright?

703
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,008
Jo Jae Hee, Jo Jae Hee....

704
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:11,067
Ahjussi.

705
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,333
Ahjussi, are you alright?

706
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:18,729
Is it over?

707
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:25,392
From her photo messages,
we can nail the culprit.

708
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,689
Investigation shows there are evidence.

709
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:31,954
I think he will be charged with harassment.

710
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:37,345
I need someone to go make a statement,
these two probably can't.

711
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,654
Can you come with me?

712
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:51,686
Yes.

713
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:07,037
About that Ahjussi...

714
01:02:07,597 --> 01:02:08,933
What?

715
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:11,760
Doctor...

716
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:13,268
What?

717
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:16,543
I feel weird.

718
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:23,187
What?

719
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:30,146
My heart... my heart's jumping up and down.

720
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:32,159
What?

721
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,834
Don't tell me I....

722
01:02:40,776 --> 01:02:43,229
I like the ahjussi?

723
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,044
What should I do?
