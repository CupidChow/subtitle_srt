INSPIRED BY A HISTORICAL EVENT

2
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,916
What you gonna do?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,791
You prick! Did you just slap my head?

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,791
Silence!

5
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,416
We're at war!

6
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,333
This is no time to horse around!

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,458
Junior Soldier Mitr Teeradham,
step forward.

8
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,208
Silence!

9
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,458
Shoulders back, chest out!

10
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,958
- One, two, three.
- Next!

11
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,958
Junior Soldier Pratueng Srisuk.

12
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,750
Junior Soldier Sak Deekamhom.

13
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,541
Junior Soldier Kosum Chumpisai.

14
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,416
Junior Soldier Cherdchai Saisrikaew.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,666
Junior Soldier Boonyong Ratanavichai.

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,125
Junior Soldier Tongpan Suetong.

17
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,625
Junior Soldier Tongeua Kraingkrai.

18
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,875
Junior Soldier Kwanmueng Janoo.

19
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,916
Junior Soldier Yodtong Janoo.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,833
Junior Soldier Hog Long Saechuen.

21
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,208
Junior Soldier Samrong Rodpai.

22
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,166
Ow!

23
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,208
Ow!

24
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,166
Ow!

25
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,000
Ow!

26
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,000
Stop grunting! You don't like it?

27
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,291
I love it!

28
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,833
It hurts the first time.
Tough it out, soldier.

29
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,666
Uh, I'm just a junior soldier.

30
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,500
Two salueng each.

31
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,041
For two.

32
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,333
Stop praying, dimwit.

33
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,083
Cherd, Nirvana
is waiting for you in there.

34
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,125
Go.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,833
Two salueng.

36
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,250
- Shit!
- No shit, it's your captain.

37
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,041
Drop!

38
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,666
What are your friends doing up there?

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,625
Drilling, sir.

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,333
- Drilling what?
- Drilling a hole…

41
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,750
I mean, training, sir.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
Don't stop until I tell you to.

43
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,416
Silence.

44
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,750
Eight, nine, ten…

45
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,791
Hey, sneaky brats. What are you up to?

46
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,375
Don't run away!

47
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,875
Junior soldiers, stop!

48
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,458
You recite our motto every day.

49
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,666
Nation. Honor. Discipline. Courage.

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,000
You're trained to fight,

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,125
not to fuck.

52
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,375
Hey! Stop!

53
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,375
Stop! Hey!

54
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,750
Come on, Tang!

55
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,000
What's that?

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,750
Stop!

57
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,916
Drop and give me ten!

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,416
- One!
- One!

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,250
- Minus one!
- Minus one!

60
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,666
- Minus two!
- Minus two!

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,875
- Minus one!
- Minus one!

62
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,166
Seriously,

63
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,625
even if you tell me
that you no longer love me,

64
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,583
I won't lose my head.

65
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,000
Or maybe you've taken ill?

66
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,125
No.

67
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,958
Then, what's wrong, Pen? Just tell me.

68
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:17,916
Besides those two misfortunes,
I'm not afraid of anything in this world.

69
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,416
You're going to be a father.

70
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,958
Pen,

71
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,250
what did you just say?

72
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,583
You're going to be a father.

73
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,375
Mek! Someone might see us.

74
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,041
I'm just a lowly corporal,

75
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,500
not some big shot's son.

76
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,750
My mother is an ordinary woman.

77
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,208
I've saved up some money, but not much.

78
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,166
I'm not fortunate enough
to study abroad like others.

79
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,791
But I've seen foreigners do this.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Be my wife.

81
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,833
You're supposed to say "marry me".

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,916
Mar..

83
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,125
Mar… ry… me.

84
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:28,875
Yes!

85
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,958
No, you have to ask me that!

86
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,041
Whatever.

87
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,750
Corporal!

88
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,791
Corporal!

89
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,583
Yes?

90
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,208
I was laying a net behind that island.

91
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,041
Then I saw them all over the Gulf.

92
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,916
Slow down, Uncle.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,833
What do you mean? What's all over?

94
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,750
Iron ships. With lots of guns.

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,000
It's the enemy! The enemy's here!

96
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,708
Their ships are everywhere!

97
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,208
The enemy is attacking us!

98
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,333
Our army has advanced
into several territories.

99
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,958
Siam should avoid the same fate.

100
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,333
CHUMPHON

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,416
The Japanese Army prepares
to advance further into India and China.

102
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,958
You will allow our Imperial forces
to use Siam as our base.

103
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,708
Your government agrees to pay
war reparations and give us supplies.

104
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,875
We have experimented
on this biological weapon.

105
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,875
We don't want Siam to suffer this.

106
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,583
You need to see what our soldiers
will do to our enemies.

107
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,791
It's not our policy to fight an ally…

108
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,625
…unless the ally wants to fight us.

109
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,416
We'll put up a show of resistance.

110
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,000
Do not lose more than necessary.

111
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,541
Follow me! Watch out!

112
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,791
Hey!

113
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,916
Stay out of the road!

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,958
Move! Move!

115
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:50,875
Alerting all units.

116
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,791
We have detected several warships
approaching from the East.

117
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,333
Mobilize all troops along the coast
within one hour and prepare the defenses.

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,791
What's the goddamn rush?

119
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,916
I'm sure it's something bad.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,458
Bad for who? Just leave me out of it.

121
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,583
Give me a minute, Captain.

122
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,166
Mek, what's happening?

123
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,291
Hello, Mrs. Tarn.

124
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,041
Why do you have to take him, Captain?

125
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,875
It's his death warrant.

126
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,041
Mok's just a kid.

127
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,500
Mok,

128
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,916
I've made steamed curry. Go have some.

129
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,708
All junior soldiers
have to report for duty.

130
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,333
This is an order.

131
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,875
Even I can't disobey an order.

132
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,166
The point is, Mok is a soldier.

133
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,041
You must not forget that.

134
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,708
What about the one who gave that order?

135
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,375
Did he forget

136
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,750
that he already took
Mek's and Mok's father away?

137
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,791
Does he want to take my whole family?

138
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,166
To have them all killed…

139
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,541
HAPPY MIND AND BODY AT THE BEACH

140
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,125
Where are you going?

141
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,500
To stay at my friend's for a few days.

142
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,791
Want to come with me?

143
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,750
Go on, keep running
for the rest of your life.

144
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,625
Since you were little,

145
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,500
I've never seen
you stand up and face a problem.

146
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,333
Always avoiding it.

147
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,625
Always running away.

148
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,625
I still believe though,

149
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,125
that one day,

150
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,333
when your back is against the wall,

151
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,625
you'll realize

152
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:54,041
that you have to fight
for what really matters to you.

153
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,541
Yes, sir.

154
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,750
Mok is a soldier.

155
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,041
He's going to serve his country.

156
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,375
But your husband was a traitor.

157
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,708
It's totally different.

158
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,916
To me, it's the same thing.

159
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,625
You can run away from the army,
from Mom, from me, from everyone.

160
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,208
But do you even know where you're going?

161
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,166
I don't know.

162
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,625
I don't know.

163
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,791
But I won't stay here like some cow

164
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,208
waiting to be slaughtered. For what?

165
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,958
I never wanted to be
a soldier like you and Dad.

166
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,416
I just want to come home
to have dinner with Mom,

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,875
with you, and with Pen.

168
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,291
Not with something called "nation".

169
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,041
For me,

170
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,458
"Nation"…

171
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,666
means everyone in our family.

172
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:53,916
You're going to be an uncle.

173
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,666
Mek,

174
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,750
run away with me.

175
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,708
Don't go and get yourself killed.

176
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,458
I have to go

177
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,833
to protect you,

178
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,291
protect Mom,

179
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,625
protect Pen,

180
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,666
and my child.

181
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,583
You always want everything,

182
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,125
but you never fight for anything.

183
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,750
No, Mok.

184
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,875
Corporal Mek!

185
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,750
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,750
Are you done?

187
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,791
Yes, sir.

188
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,125
I said what I had to say.

189
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,583
Now, it's up to you,

190
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
whether you want to fight or to flee.

191
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,750
Emergency updates from
southern provinces at 2 a.m. last night.

192
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,208
Japanese troops have landed on the coasts

193
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,500
of Songkhla, Pattani, Prachuap Khiri Khan,

194
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,666
and Chumphon.

195
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,041
Be careful with the crate!

196
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,791
Don't fucking hide!

197
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,625
Go and fight!

198
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,458
Mok, what are you doing?

199
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,583
Mok!

200
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,958
Help!

201
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,041
Help me!

202
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,541
Help!

203
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,333
At 7:30 a.m. today,

204
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,833
the Thai government has instructed
all military and police units

205
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,541
to cease fire and await new orders.

206
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,375
The governments of Thailand and Japan

207
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
are now engaged in negotiations.

208
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,333
Damage assessment is now underway.

209
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,833
All Thai and Japanese
patrol units are instructed

210
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,541
to survey the damage immediately.

211
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,083
Catch them!

212
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,333
They're gone.

213
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,958
The government wants to announce
that the negotiations

214
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,250
are progressing positively.

215
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,125
We are a friend of Japan.

216
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,416
Citizens should assist and cooperate

217
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,375
- with our Japanese friends.
- Sak!

218
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,375
Thai and Japanese soldiers

219
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,458
will fight shoulder to shoulder.

220
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
- Sak!
- Dad!

221
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
- Pen!
- Vaew!

222
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,666
Where's Sak?

223
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,833
Keaw, it's OK.

224
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,583
Vaew, come with me.

225
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,000
Come on.

226
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,458
Calm down.

227
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,916
Listen, I'm also looking for Mok.

228
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,250
If we find him,
I'm sure we'll find Sak too.

229
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,833
Kaew,

230
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,375
don't cry.

231
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,791
I promise I'll help you find your dad.

232
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,291
Get your gun ready. Be careful.

233
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,666
Yes, sir.

234
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,166
This is patrol!

235
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,041
Anyone here?

236
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,250
Junior soldier!

237
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,166
Hold on.

238
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,541
Junior soldier,

239
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,833
are you alright?

240
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,666
Let's go.

241
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,750
- Captain!
- What's going on?

242
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:29,958
I… saw…

243
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,291
He said he saw
a ghost of a junior soldier.

244
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,125
Ghost?

245
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,000
Not exactly, sir.

246
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,458
It's a junior soldier

247
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,375
that eats human flesh.

248
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,541
Where?

249
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,208
Help! It bit me!

250
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,041
What the fuck is happening?

251
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:18,041
July 15, 1939. Result

252
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,541
of the 256th injection
of Fumetsu-A44 virus.

253
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:27,416
In Group 1, no creatures died,

254
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:33,750
but all of them exhibit a high level
of strength and aggressiveness

255
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,583
and rapid signs of cannibalism.

256
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,375
They display
combative and efficient behavior.

257
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,208
LUNG ABLATION EXPERIMENT
LIVER ABLATION EXPERIMENT

258
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,041
KIDNEY EXCISION EXPERIMENT

259
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,583
The subjects in Group 2

260
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,958
are behaving differently.

261
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:50,875
They are much stronger and faster.

262
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:55,791
But they do not attack
or prey on one another.

263
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,958
They still have self-control.

264
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:01,041
But how long?

265
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,458
Mek!

266
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,208
- Pen.
- Where were you? What happened?

267
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,708
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

268
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,041
The doctor said I'll recover
in a few days.

269
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,000
Where's Mok?

270
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,250
Have you seen him?

271
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,083
Huh?

272
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,750
No, I haven't.

273
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,083
Hope he did what he said.

274
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,083
I hope he ran away that night.

275
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,375
Corporal.

276
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,041
Your brother didn't run away.

277
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:37,833
He was with us on the battlefield.

278
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,916
What? Is that true?

279
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,833
Yes.

280
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,958
Did you see him with your own eyes?

281
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,166
- Mek!
- Where exactly did you see him?

282
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,541
- Mek!
- Corporal Mek!

283
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,083
The Japanese wants to see us now.

284
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,750
- Take me to him right now. Where?
- Mek!

285
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,833
- Get up.
- I said now!

286
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,875
You made an egregious mistake.

287
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,166
I am so sorry…

288
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,458
You have to show responsibility.

289
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:20,333
Long live The Emperor!

290
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,416
Why do you want to see us?

291
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,666
Two men.

292
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,541
One wants to die for his country.

293
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,416
The other wants to live.

294
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,625
Which one is more patriotic?

295
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,708
The dead one.

296
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,083
And which one can serve his nation longer?

297
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,375
The living one.

298
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,416
Correct.

299
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,666
What escaped from this crate…

300
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,791
…is the prototype of Fumetsu,

301
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,125
a biological weapon that we've developed.

302
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,125
But we still know too little about it.

303
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,041
What I saw wasn't a Japanese soldier.

304
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:20,958
It's a Thai soldier.

305
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:24,791
That's exactly the problem.

306
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,416
When a Fumetsu fails to kill off its prey,

307
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,666
it'll turn them into its own species.

308
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,083
Captain, we have to report this
to the authorities.

309
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:37,583
No need.

310
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,958
They've already decided
to end this problem,

311
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,291
in utmost silence.

312
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,458
This is Captain Nakamura
from Destroyer Task Force.

313
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,166
You are the only Thai soldiers

314
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,666
who know this island
like the back of your hand.

315
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:04,000
So, I want you to join
the Destroyer Task Force.

316
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,583
MOST URGENT
SUBJECT: TRANSFER OF SPECIAL OFFICERS

317
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,708
To apprehend them alive.

318
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,541
Alive?

319
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,458
No matter how many Fumetsu there are,

320
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,791
whether Thai or Japanese…

321
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,833
…if you don't want the people
of Siam to fall into greater harm,

322
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,250
you have to work with us.

323
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,708
Siam has no choice.

324
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,833
We have to take responsibility
for this together.

325
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:04,791
July 18, 1939. Results

326
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:09,000
of the 257th injection
of Fumetsu-A44 virus.

327
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,583
A larger dose of the virus was injected,
and the results were positive.

328
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,791
The specimens secreted a liquid.

329
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,750
triggering fatal self-combustion

330
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:47,416
that ended their lives.

331
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,416
But will self-combustion happen
in humans too?

332
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:58,708
If so, my plan has worked.
The Fumetsu have a fatal weakness.

333
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,625
THE FUMETSU IS FLAMMABLE.

334
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,166
Siam, December 11, 1941.

335
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,375
The escaped human subject is Private Nobu.

336
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:17,916
What is his behavior
when contact with potential prey?

337
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,250
Will the Fumetsu continue to evolve?

338
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:25,250
The harm is still unknown.

339
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:12,916
Captain,

340
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,666
I believe there are a lot more of them.

341
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,958
Look at these corpses.

342
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,000
The victims didn't have a chance
to defend themselves.

343
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,291
Father.

344
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,500
Sorry.

345
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,416
Captain.

346
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,791
They went that way, sir.

347
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,291
How many of them?

348
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,083
About ten, sir.

349
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,208
Lead the way.

350
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,333
CHERRY BLOSSOMS ARE BLOOMING
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

351
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,958
I LOVE YOU ETERNALLY.

352
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,541
Mrs. Tarn.

353
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:29,000
I'd like Mek to go
work with me in the barracks.

354
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,166
He seems cut out for it,
just like his father Mann.

355
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,166
Let him decide for himself.

356
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,208
I'm ready to serve the country, sir.

357
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,458
Good.

358
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:46,708
Young private loses his head
Going to the barracks means he'll be dead

359
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:51,708
War is what he'll face
But I'll be fine because I'll stay in bed

360
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:55,208
I'll stay in bed, but you'll be dead!

361
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,416
- Sarge!
- Yes, sir!

362
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,875
- I'll stay in bed…
- Mok, you asshole.

363
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,375
But you'll be so dead…

364
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:26,750
I'm still hungry.

365
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,250
You're still hungry too, I know.

366
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,250
The Japs…

367
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,708
made us into this.

368
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,333
Why don't we just go and eat them?

369
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,375
No!

370
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,958
Inn.

371
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,500
They are nearby.

372
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,208
Hide!

373
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:50,541
It doesn't matter what we are.
I'll always love you, Nobu-san.

374
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,333
But now, it's time

375
00:43:54,916 --> 00:44:00,041
for me to leave your memory.

376
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,791
The cherry blossoms are blooming.

377
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:09,916
Do it!

378
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,958
- Dammit!
- Why do you have to torture him?

379
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,750
You'd better just kill him off.

380
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,166
Now we know where the Fumetsu are.

381
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,625
Tell them.

382
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,875
We won't send in our men,

383
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:37,458
and we won't kill them.

384
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:40,291
But we need to capture them
to study their behavior.

385
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,083
Shoot it.

386
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,416
If you hadn't become this thing,

387
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,500
what would you have dreamt of doing?

388
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:49,583
I would've…

389
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:53,458
helped out my dad at his gold shop.

390
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,291
I'd have become a lawyer.

391
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,500
I think you'd make a fine gravedigger.

392
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,291
I'd want my kid to have a good education,

393
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:11,333
so she could find a job

394
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,333
that paid well.

395
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,125
What about you, Prao?

396
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,166
I'm better off like this.

397
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,875
These creatures
have been created to replace us.

398
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:34,916
But something is absent inside them.

399
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,875
Honor,

400
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,666
nation, and race.

401
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,083
Something greater than themselves.

402
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,541
They may be physically stronger than us,

403
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,875
but their minds are weak.

404
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:48,666
They will eventually devour one another.

405
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,208
Kai.

406
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,833
Captain.

407
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,416
What's this man doing here?

408
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,000
My son.

409
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,791
Kai.

410
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,458
What have you done to my son?

411
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,583
Kai!

412
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,791
What the fuck have you done?

413
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,208
Kai!

414
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:21,666
Kai.

415
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,333
Mok.

416
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,416
What about you?

417
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,041
I just wanted to write songs

418
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,583
and novels.

419
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:36,125
Maybe go to Bangkok.

420
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,708
You already wrote a song.

421
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,333
Sing it to me.

422
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:52,666
Wake up, my friends, here comes the sun

423
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:57,750
Going to class, you'll have to run

424
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:03,708
But why go to school, you're such a fool

425
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:07,166
Failed all exams, it's just a scam

426
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:13,250
We're so happy, hunting for fowl

427
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,375
Boozing and whoring, till sunset hour

428
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,750
Shoulder to shoulder, we'll march together

429
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,041
Let's go, buddies! We'll go everywhere!

430
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,416
My dear friends

431
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,416
Happy is our memory

432
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Time flies past, we drift apart

433
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,000
But our love will always last

434
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:48,000
Don't worry when we have to say goodbye

435
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:51,166
Happiness and tragedy are in our minds

436
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:58,875
Shoulder to shoulder

437
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:02,916
We'll march together

438
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:09,916
Our memories are ever stronger

439
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,916
We're friends forever

440
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:34,541
Has anyone seen Inn and Kai?

441
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,458
Where are they?

442
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,500
They've run back home already.

443
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,541
What about the Jap?

444
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,208
Gone.

445
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,041
Gone where?

446
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,958
Just gone.

447
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,458
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

448
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:02,666
We're going to the village

449
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,708
to look for Inn and Kai.

450
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,708
If we find them, we'll bring them back.

451
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,750
If we don't, we'll go our separate ways.

452
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,583
- Why did you kill him?
- Corporal, stop.

453
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,250
- Hey! Hey!
- Mek.

454
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,625
- Mek, calm down.
- Captain!

455
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,333
- Those bastards!
- Calm down. Hey!

456
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:22,291
- That prick just killed our guy!
- Stop it.

457
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,416
I said stop! Mek, look at me!

458
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,708
We have no authority here.

459
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:27,875
Turn on the cyanide.

460
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,250
Captain,

461
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,208
are you going to let
the fucking Japs do this to our people?

462
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:40,750
They're not our people, Mek!

463
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:44,041
Now, there are only humans and non-humans.

464
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,250
Sarge,

465
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,291
don't let him move.

466
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,375
Corporal!

467
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,250
- I said calm down. Stop it, Mek!
- Hey!

468
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,416
Deal with your man.

469
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,000
Go home, Mek.

470
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,708
You're discharged from the mission.

471
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:26,958
Captain…

472
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,541
- Captain…
- Please!

473
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,750
I already took your brother.

474
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:37,000
Don't make me feel
even more guilty to your mother.

475
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,791
- Take him out.
- Yes, sir!

476
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:42,458
You can't do this to me.

477
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,750
Let me go!

478
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,000
Just go, Corporal.

479
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,250
Your masterpiece is a disaster.

480
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,458
They can't even control themselves.

481
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,083
Can I kill them now?

482
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:44,416
Your job is to follow my orders.

483
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,166
I want them alive.

484
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,958
I knew you'd say that.

485
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,166
Yes, you give the orders,

486
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,541
but I decide how to execute them.

487
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,500
The Destroyer Task Force
will do what I tell them.

488
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:04,916
Lay siege to the village.

489
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,541
- Yes, sir.
- But why?

490
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,500
They're still kids.

491
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,416
They'll go home to their families.

492
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:39,125
Here is your offering

493
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,333
We summon the spirit of the Huntsman

494
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:48,791
Please come down to us

495
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:55,000
Here is your offering

496
00:54:55,083 --> 00:55:00,708
Please come down

497
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:07,708
Come down, show us you are here

498
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,291
Where is Sak's spirit?

499
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:43,375
We're inviting him here

500
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:48,875
Your wife has made offerings

501
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:54,041
To invite your spirit

502
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:57,916
Come down, Sak. Come down!

503
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,416
Come down here!

504
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:08,750
Sak! Can you hear me?

505
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:13,125
I'm in pain! Help me, Vaew!

506
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:15,208
- Sak!
- Vaew.

507
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:17,166
I'm so cold.

508
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,458
Sak.

509
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,750
- Dad!
- My child?

510
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,333
Vaew, help me.

511
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:54,958
Vaew!

512
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,083
Sak?

513
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:09,791
Is that you, Sak?

514
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:15,500
Dad! Daddy!

515
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,833
THE ARMY REINSTATES SIX OFFICERS
WRONGLY ACCUSED OF TREASON

516
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:22,750
My dear.

517
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:23,666
LT. COL. TEERADHAM
CAPTAIN PANSRIKAN, CAPTAIN CHAMJIT

518
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,041
I'm worried about Mok.

519
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,666
I don't know where to find him.

520
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:33,958
I have no idea if he's dead or alive.

521
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:40,041
My dear, please look after him
and protect him from harm.

522
00:58:58,291 --> 00:58:59,125
Mom.

523
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,125
Did you find Mok?

524
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,291
What are you doing out here? Get inside.

525
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:04,541
Did you find Mok?

526
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:09,166
Bring his body back,
so I can at least cremate him.

527
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,125
Mom.

528
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,041
Mok…

529
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,833
Mok's still alive.

530
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:24,250
He ran away the day the Japanese invaded.

531
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:25,750
Is it true?

532
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,916
How did you find out?

533
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,833
I had a talk with him.

534
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:32,041
I actually told him to run away.

535
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,291
Thanks, Mek. Thank you.

536
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,291
Is that you, Cherd?

537
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,500
Are you hurt?

538
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,041
Pen!

539
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,833
What's wrong?

540
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,166
Sit down.

541
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,333
There was a Japanese soldier,

542
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,875
torn in half.

543
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,083
Like a wild animal attacked him.

544
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,041
Mom, listen carefully.

545
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,041
If something weird shows up, shoot it.

546
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,916
If it still moves, burn it.

547
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,083
No matter what happens,
stay close to fire.

548
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,208
Got it?

549
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,166
Yes.

550
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:51,750
Take care of Pen for me.

551
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:54,791
Pen.

552
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:58,958
Don't be scared.

553
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:00,666
I'll be back soon.

554
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:22,708
Vaew!

555
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,708
Vaew!

556
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,291
Come on, Kaew.

557
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:29,625
Vaew!

558
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,250
Mommy!

559
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:40,416
Kaew!

560
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,166
Sak.

561
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,125
Kaew!

562
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:00,708
Dad…

563
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,583
I'm your dad, Kaew.

564
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:10,750
It's me.

565
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,000
I'm your dad.

566
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,208
Kaew…

567
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,291
Dad…

568
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:37,625
Dad…

569
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,291
Are you hurt?

570
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,375
Dad.

571
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,791
Who hurt you, Dad?

572
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:01,000
Dad.

573
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:04,750
Dad.

574
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,541
Dad!

575
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:18,250
Ready!

576
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:26,000
Kaew, come here.

577
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,583
Dad!

578
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,708
Attack!

579
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,375
- Run away!
- They're my boys!

580
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,083
You bastard!

581
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,750
Sarge!

582
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:47,625
Run!

583
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,416
Mok.

584
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,166
Mek.

585
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,958
Mek!

586
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,208
Nakamura's methods
will turn this into a war.

587
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:43,666
But…

588
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,375
we're already in a war, Sir.

589
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:47,125
I know.

590
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:51,750
But if your father
keeps attacking the Fumetsu,

591
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:54,083
they will start another war.

592
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,625
One that we can never win.

593
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,250
I didn't want to do it.

594
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,208
Let me show you something.

595
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,125
You set a time bomb inside them.

596
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:12,041
Yes, that was my goal from the start,

597
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,416
but what you're about to see
is even beyond my expectations.

598
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:27,041
July 18, 1939: Test results of batch 257.

599
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:31,333
After the test specimens self-combusted,

600
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:36,208
the ash triggered
a unique regeneration in nature.

601
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:40,666
A Fumetsu is now more
than just a savage animal.

602
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,625
You're committing treason.

603
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,666
You're aware of that, right?

604
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:46,958
I'd rather be a traitor

605
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:50,958
than create a monster.

606
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:56,083
But they will burn themselves up
and disintegrate anyway.

607
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,416
Before they reach that point,

608
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,041
who knows how many people
they could devour or infect.

609
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,375
This is much more than you
and your father can handle.

610
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,333
The Fumetsu are much more than a weapon,

611
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:16,833
but your father
only sees them as monsters.

612
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:18,375
And so,

613
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:20,541
we'll never be able to beat them.

614
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,583
We're here. Please get out of the truck.

615
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:32,541
Why did you bring us here?

616
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,833
- Come down, please.
- Thank you.

617
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:36,750
What's going on?

618
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,875
What is all this?

619
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:41,500
Venerable Abbot.

620
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,291
Bless you all.

621
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:46,291
Sir, do you know why they brought us here?

622
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:50,375
Everyone, please come with me.

623
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,833
Hey, sis,

624
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,416
have you heard the news?

625
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:03,875
The Medium's whole family
was killed last night.

626
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:07,541
Someone found the bodies,
mauled to bloody mush.

627
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,458
What on earth is happening in our village?

628
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,083
Right.

629
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:15,750
I heard some Japanese soldiers
were found dead too.

630
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:22,000
Torn apart by some animal.
Makes me shudder.

631
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,708
Is that like what you told me?

632
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:29,333
Please, come in.

633
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,791
Come inside.

634
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:35,666
Listen up.

635
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:40,083
The Japanese have found
dead bodies in the jungle.

636
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:44,250
They didn't move them,
fearing they'd offend our belief.

637
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:49,750
They want you to identify whether
the victims are from your families.

638
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:50,666
Enter.

639
01:12:57,625 --> 01:12:58,458
Mok…

640
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,083
Chuen.

641
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,208
Mok…

642
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,958
Mrs. Taan…

643
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,791
PRATUENG SRISUK, MITR TEERADHAM
SAK DEEKAMHOM, SAMRONG RODPAI

644
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:35,083
Arrived?

645
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:47,041
- Are you from the Personnel Office?
- Yes.

646
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,083
They plan to kill
all the villagers in the forest

647
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,291
to eliminate all eyewitnesses.

648
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,375
They also…

649
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,666
…want to hush up everything,
as if nothing ever happened.

650
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,916
You…

651
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,958
will register their deaths
as casualties of war.

652
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,375
Fucking Japs!

653
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,125
They're humans!

654
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,041
How could you do this?

655
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,750
Don't make things worse
than they already are.

656
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,083
Our superiors have already agreed to this.

657
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,916
Take him out!

658
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:38,125
Dammit.

659
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:17,416
Hey!

660
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,625
What the hell are you doing?

661
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:35,958
Inn!

662
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:24,375
Assholes!

663
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,500
Stop fighting each other already!

664
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:29,666
Right now,

665
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:34,416
there's something more important.

666
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:48,166
They caught me and tortured me,

667
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,083
but I escaped.

668
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,291
Now, they…

669
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,708
have taken our parents away…

670
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,916
and they'll kill them all!

671
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,041
This might be a trap

672
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:23,458
to lure us out.

673
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,125
My wife.

674
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,166
My child.

675
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,291
Our… mom!

676
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,583
If you're so scared,

677
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:48,166
just run and hide like a coward.

678
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:55,208
Fuck you, Mek.

679
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:02,166
If you're with me,

680
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,458
follow me now!

681
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,166
Come home with me.

682
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:34,541
Come to me, my son.

683
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:39,625
Let's go home, my child.

684
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:48,833
Come home, my son.

685
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,291
We're here to take you home.

686
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:56,833
Let's go home together.

687
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:01,541
I've come with a blessing
to take you home.

688
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:07,166
- My dear Inn…
- Come home with your mother and I.

689
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,458
Let's go home together.

690
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,291
Let's go home.

691
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:19,833
Time to come home.

692
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:24,750
My dear…

693
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:43,000
Father.

694
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,041
I have something to tell you.

695
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:46,791
Later.

696
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,125
Chuen.

697
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,916
- Mek!
- Mok!

698
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,666
- Mek!
- Mek!

699
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,583
Mek!

700
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,916
Kill them all! Shoot!

701
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,583
Attack!

702
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,500
Mom!

703
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,458
Mom!

704
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:42,500
Mom!

705
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,708
Mom!

706
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:50,250
Mok!

707
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,625
Bite Mom! Now!

708
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,166
Bite her!

709
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,916
Mek, don't!

710
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,125
Mek!

711
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:23,041
Mek!

712
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,500
Get off!

713
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,333
Mom, wake up!

714
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:44,666
Why didn't you bite her?

715
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,750
Evacuate, now!

716
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:53,791
Why did you do this to Pen?

717
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:58,791
She'd be better off dead.

718
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,208
I didn't do it.

719
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,416
They did.

720
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,458
And they…

721
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,875
will pay for it.

722
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:37,750
Listen,

723
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:42,958
you saw what they did to us.

724
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:49,625
I…

725
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:52,375
will never let them

726
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,416
kill anyone we love ever again.

727
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:01,833
We'll make everyone like us,

728
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,041
and we'll kill our enemies…

729
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,458
to the very last man!

730
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,541
What the fuck did you just say, Mek?

731
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,208
"Make everyone like us"?

732
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,041
What does that mean?

733
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,416
Didn't you see…

734
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,583
what they did to your mother?

735
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:32,291
Prao.

736
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,375
And what they did to our friends?

737
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,625
We need to build our own army.

738
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,333
I'm not going.

739
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:53,916
I don't want to kill anymore.

740
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:57,541
My brother died

741
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,291
because he went along with you guys.

742
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:02,916
I'm out.

743
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,041
What you're doing

744
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,291
is not going to end this war.

745
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,125
Pen!

746
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:10,875
You fucking bastard!

747
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,958
Mek, you monster! What have you done?

748
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:24,208
What have you done?

749
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:31,000
Didn't you tell me…

750
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,791
she'd be better off dead?

751
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:42,208
We will lure the Japanese
to the cave and kill them all.

752
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,208
Did you capture the Fumetsu?

753
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:10,750
Bring me his notebook.

754
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,375
I never wanted to be
a soldier like you and Dad.

755
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,041
I just want to come home to have dinner
with Mom, you, and Pen.

756
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,250
You always want everything…

757
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:26,333
but you never fight for anything.

758
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,625
No, Mok.

759
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:21,791
THE FUMETSU IS FLAMMABLE.

760
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:27,833
Get the flamethrower.

761
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,541
We'll exterminate them all.

762
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:28,208
Turn off the light.

763
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,625
Burn them!

764
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:37,958
Follow them!

765
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,625
For me,

766
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
"nation"…

767
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:59,583
means everyone in our family.

768
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:55,083
Doctor!

769
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:11,875
That's impossible.

770
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:45,333
He said we already
signed a deal with his army

771
01:49:45,416 --> 01:49:49,375
to remain completely invisible
during this mission.

772
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:51,708
There'll be no recognition, no honor.

773
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,250
If we get caught,

774
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:56,916
they won't take any responsibility.

775
01:49:57,625 --> 01:50:00,041
They'll deny everything.

776
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:02,916
Good luck, everyone.

777
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,500
ALL JUNIOR SOLDIERS FOUGHT VALIANTLY

778
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:06,333
THAT DAY WILL REMAIN
FOREVER IN OUR MEMORIES
