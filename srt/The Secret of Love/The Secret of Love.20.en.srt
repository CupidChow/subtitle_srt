Please forgive your dad's selfishness.

Who uses a fountain pen anymore?

174
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,100
You rascal, you have no patience at all for whatever you do.

175

Gifting you a fountain pen is to train your patience.

Can you turn off the light? Thanks.

Call Director Zheng over.

190

Director Zheng requested leave. Do you want me to come over?

No, it's fine.

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,300
but Chairman Li's phone was with me the whole time.

249
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,430
what other reason could there be?

250
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,860
Grandpa, I didn't suspect you at all.

251
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,080
Then, you come to find me for another thing?

252
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,290
Jiashang, you must remember.

Zheng He, I talked to Grandpa.

263
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,520
You don't need to explain.

264

If I didn't trust Chairman Li, I wouldn't have come back to work.

But such a big thing happened,

it's impossible for me to remain the same, right?

267
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,990
Zheng He, we have been friends for so many years. You can directly say what's on your mind.

268

Actually, my father's last message

Or are there any questions regarding the new products?

272
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,860
But I saw in the news how both you and Su Yi were there.

273
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:44,050
Jiashang, although I look simple-minded,

274
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,340
I understand it all in my heart.

275
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,990
I have been telling myself that I overthink.

276
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,910
It has to be that I overthink. So you tell me.

277
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,120
Have I been overthinking or not?

278

That day, Su Yi and I were at the pet clinic,

279

we have our alibi.

280
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,670
Afterward, we went to see Uncle Zheng. It was only for business.

281
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,320
I even took her there.

282
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,260
Then let me ask you once more.

283
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,810
Are there other things you are hiding from me?

284
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,450
No.
