Please explain it! Explain it to us!

15
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,040
Please calm down! The amount of preservatives we used for Secret

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,950
definitely complies with the national prescription!

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,320
If it was so reliable and safe why don't other make-up products contain it?

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,910
They say that Propylparaben is toxic when inhaled by people. Do you admit that?

19
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,510
Please explain it! Explain it!

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,980
Explain that!

21

CEO Li! Who will be held accountable for this?

24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,920
Lee Group has not received any notification regarding this issue.

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,720
Watch your words!

26

CEO Li!

28

Xiyang, tell Su Yi not to come to the office today.

29
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,840
CEO Li, I have found the people responsible for the formula.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,230
Do you want to interrogate them yourself?

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,510
Who told you to come and ask for who is accountable?

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,060
Ch-Chairman Li.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,290
Then you interrogate them.

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,720
Has anyone suspicious tried to acquire information about the formula?

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,760
Has there been anything abnormal with the security monitors?

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,430
No... everything was normal.

37
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,660
Stop asking! It's pointless.

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,390
CEO Li, I really don't know how this could have happened!

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,910
No one has even touched the key from the materials room!

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,340
Is it possible that it got leaked from somewhere else?

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,570
For example, from a former researcher.

42
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,520
Your words make sense.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,720
Secretary Li, report it back to Chairman Li.

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,100
Tell him. The fire is singeing our eyebrows.
(T/N: It's a desperate situation)

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,820
I don't have time to play catch the spy with him.

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,900
What should we do now?

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,460
Up until 8, the negative reviews have grown to 90% of the total.

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,920
A third of the mainstream media channels are already reporting about it!

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,990
All of the KOL (Key Opinion Leader) in the beauty industry are speaking out to get popularity!

50
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,900
CEO Li! We're in trouble!

51
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,760
There are people outside holding our logo and products!

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
They also printed the side effects of the Propylparaben!

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Oh my god!

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,910
What is going on? I haven't even finished my make-up!

55
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,730
All right, everyone, calm down!

56
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,720
Take a seat! I have something to say.

57
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,870
I am accustomed to this kind of professional error.

58
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,070
Someone must have plotted this.

59
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,200
Trying to discredit the name of Lee Group!

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,600
So, using scientific clarification will become a form of forced innocence.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,680
There is only one solution in these kinds of situations.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,520
Which is... exposing the spy!

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,690
Placing Lee Group in a victim position.

64
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,020
Thus, winning the sympathy of the masses and changing public opinion.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,630
Only then will people be willing to listen to our explanation.

66
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,320
Who was the one who leaked the formula?

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,250
If it really gets bad, then we can only let the one in charge take the blame.

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,230
The spy is so evil!

69
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,450
Would it be the competitor's undercover spy?

Why did you get up so early?

Also, everyone's reaction to Li Jiashang is still very hopeful.

81

I believe he will definitely be able to bring the Lee Group out of this dangerous situation.

Why are you using the preservative to make things difficult?

In business actions and terms, of course it is for benefit.

Besides, Ms. Su, what evidence do you have to suspect me?

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,290
I am afraid it is the thief trying to catch the thief, passing on the blame to someone innocent.

I feel that, by getting the formula in an abnormally short time

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,670
- She has her own hardships.
- Why are you all covering her?

162
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,720
Li Jiashang, my best friend is covering her!

163
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,420
Xia Xiyang, you are my fiancee, yet you are also protecting her!

164
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,490
Why isn't anyone backing me up?

165
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,380
Su Yi was the victim from the very beginning!

166
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,350
Based on the accounts of Lee Group, her father was not corrupt, but they charged him of the crime.

167
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,220
Who told you her father wasn't corrupt?

168
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,190
It was Li Jiashang, wasn't it?

169
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,510
Let me tell you. I checked the accounts day and night. It was embezzlement.

170
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,930
Li Jiashang only told her he wasn't corrupt to comfort her!

171
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,640
That's impossible...

172
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,520
Ever since she came back to China, A'Shang injured his hand and Zhu Yue left. My father...

173
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,520
As for her... she is totally fine!

174
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,740
She's bringing misfortune to everyone!

175
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,600
What you just said really crossed the limit.

176
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I will take it that you haven't been in good shape and are spouting nonsense.

177
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,730
Don't be like this again.

178
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,320
Regarding the itemized accounts of her father,

179
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,070
let them resolve it on their own. I don't want to betray A'Shang.

180
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,720
Vice President Su, are you here? Chairman Li is waiting for you.

181
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,070
My apologies. Something suddenly came up.

182
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,000
I can't be there.

183
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,750
Come in!

184
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,370
What's wrong, my Vice President Su?

185
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,370
I would like view the results of Lee Group's internal investigation of my father's accounts.

186
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,860
Didn't you already read that?

187
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,150
I want the real report.

188
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm rather tired. Let's have a drink.

189
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,700
This tea is from Manni's father. Try it.

190
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,680
I know you did it to comfort me. I am not blaming you.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,670
However, I want to know the real result.

192
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,530
Even if you don't read it, you should know.

193
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,820
I don't believe it.

194
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,540
I want to personally view my father's accounts to confirm it.

195
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,430
CEO Li, these are the raw materials Mu Feng was in charge of.

196
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,060
There was a storage failure due to problems with the temperature.

197
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,670
Hence, we needed to recall everything.

198
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,920
However, after the purchase payment was approved,

199
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,700
he purchased only part of the raw materials.

200
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,190
Hence, the company thought that he misappropriated the funds for personal usage.

201
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,490
Look here.

202
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,580
The application forms for the raw materials and scrap materials,

203
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,700
including the financial accounts, carried his signatures.

204
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,690
- Fine. You can go back to work.
- Okay.

205
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,080
Yiyi. Su Yi.

Hey!

209
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,150
There's great news. I recently found a new breakthrough.

210
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,690
Interested to hear it?

211
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,320
What's wrong, Su Yi?

212
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,370
I don't want to keep this up anymore.

213
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,310
What?

214
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,490
Don't tell me you really mean it.

215
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,800
Tell me. If my father was really corrupt,

216
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,660
is there any point in everything we have done?

217
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:41,140
Did you suffer a big blow that your brain can't think clearly now, Older Sister?

218
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,180
Okay. Even if Mu Feng was really corrupt,

219
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,480
and really absconded with the funds,

220
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,030
what about the corpse in the car accident? This trivial matter resulted from you.

221
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,030
Hence, you need to be responsible for this until the end. Understand?

222
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,400
Let me reconsider.

223
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,730
Stop thinking. Cheer up now. Get it?

224
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,530
I'm leaving. I found the policeman who investigated the car accident.

225
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,520
Wait for my good news.

226
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,920
These two solutions are in fact very cheap, but they need to be stored at a low temperature.

227
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,100
The caviar essence is relatively more expensive but it doesn't need low temperature.

228
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,280
We store these two raw materials separately.

229
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,750
How much do you know about Mu Feng's embezzlement?

230
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,120
I have some impression.

231
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,610
After his car accident, the verdict for his corruption case was very quick.

232
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,010
It happened too long ago.

233
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,910
There are no detailed files and information in the warehouse.

234
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,920
Go back to work.

235
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,530
CEO Li, Chairman Li wasn't happy when you were here last.

236
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,280
Many people are here now.

237
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,200
You asked me to come here regarding the formula scandal?

238
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,320
I can't be bothered. Settle this on your own.

239
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,740
I have been investigating Mu Feng's accounts corruption case.

240
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,160
I feel that something's not right.

241
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,730
One of the reasons the materials were scrapped was improper storage at low temperature.

242
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,230
But looking at his application for the repurchase of the raw materials, the amount

243
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,760
was very high. Moreover, they didn't need to be stored at a low temperature.

244
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,580
As a senior science researcher, if Mu Feng

245
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,630
wanted to embezzle,

246
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,750
it was impossible for him to make such an elementary mistake.

247
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,490
Furthermore, how could that application be approved?

248
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,860
Do you know what you are saying?

249
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,420
Do you really think that everything you know is the truth?

250
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,640
Someone kept an account of the caviar essence,

251
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,800
added a page, and re-stapled it. That's how Mu Feng's signature was in there.

252
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,250
Seems like Lee Group really framed Mu Feng.

253
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,630
Yes.

254
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,030
However, Grandpa is the only person in Lee Group

255
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,320
who can get away with review and make a direct decision.

256
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,630
If we really need to push someone out in a dangerous time like this,

257
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,940
I will shoulder the responsibility for leaking the formula.

258
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
It's because you feel guilty towards Su Yi, right?

259
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,000
I originally planned to do this.

260
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Do you really not get it?

261
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,000
If you shoulder this responsibility, the stocks of Lee Group will plummet.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Prepare a press conference for me.

263
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
I will resign as the CEO.

264
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,800
How much confidence will there be in the stock market with a new CEO?

265
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,700
Your grandpa will never agree.

266
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,600
Why didn't you think about why he didn't attack Su Yi?

267
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Do you think he doesn't know about Su Yi?

268
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
He did it to protect you at Lee Group.

269
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
That's why he didn't expose Su Yi.

270
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,800
If you resign, do you think he will let Su Yi off?

271
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,130
Grandpa may know it's Su Yi

272
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,300
but how did he know that...

273
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Did you tell my grandpa that I helped Su Yi steal the formula?

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,630
Yes, but I did it because...

275
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
- Are you crazy?
- When Su Yi suddenly asked about the accounts, did you tell her too?

276
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,400
Li Jiashang, let me tell you.

277
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I came to Lee Group to help you.

278
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
If you resign, I will quit too.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,100
Already adults and still beating each other up?

280
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Zheng He's injury is not light too.

281
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,700
Su Yi, about your father's accounts...

282
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,500
It's fine. You don't need to comfort me.

283
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
I thought it through.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,400
- Even if my father was corrupt, I will...
- He's not.

285
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,200
It's Lee Group who wronged him.

286
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,800
And you too.

287
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
- Director Zheng.
- Director Zheng

288
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,800
Su Yi.

289
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,700
I hope you can persuade Li Jiashang.

290
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,420
To protect you, he plans to resign.

291
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,800
Don't worry.

292
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,300
I won't let him resign.

293
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Thanks.

294
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,400
Our Sanbao, our little pistachio

295
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,600
needs to come back quickly.

296
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,600
It's Lee Group who wronged your father, and you too.

297
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Someone keeps chasing me.

298
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,100
If anything happens to me, it must be Li...

299
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,200
I really hope that you don't forget that

300
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,300
Jiashang will always be a member of Lee Group.

301
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,800
Your food delivery is here.

302
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,300
Thanks.

303
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,200
You have been strange lately.

304
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,300
Pairing beer with hamburger.

305
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,700
Didn't you like pairing instant noodles with whiskey too?

306
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm different.

307
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I had the kind of sustenance of an empty soul.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,500
But I have you now and I don't need those anymore.

309
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
What's wrong? You have been unhappy lately.

310
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,440
Do you want some?

311
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,300
I'm not drinking. I need to drive you home later.

312

Yiyi, about your father being framed,

313
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,500
Grandpa is definitely the biggest suspect.

314
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,400
But, trust me, I will definitely take your side...

315
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Jiashang.

316
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,700
Okay, I won't talk about this. Let's eat our hamburgers.

317
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,200
♫ I can only be controlled silently by the emotions♫

318
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's break up.

♫ I love you more than he does ♫

320
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,000
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

321
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,800
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

322
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,600
♫ I wish you a good life ♫

323
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:46,000
♫ I understand. I won't reveal it ♫

324
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,900
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose it ♫

325
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,990
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose it ♫

326
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,800
Being with you is very special.

327
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,200
I can sense how relaxed I am.

328
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,500
♫  He knows you more than I do ♫

329
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,000
♫ But how do I extricate myself from this ♫

330
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
Without you,

331
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,800
my life is just like a robot every day. After you, you are my one and only.

332
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,900
Yiyi, I really love you very much.

333
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,800
Love is when one soul meets another.

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,400
It's not a face meeting another face.

335
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,400
My boyfriend dismantles the bridge so quickly.
(T/N: idiom meaning 'dismantling the bridge after getting what they want')

336
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

337
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,500
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

338
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,600
But when you love someone, shouldn't you consider the other party too?

339
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
And do what the other party wants to do too?

340
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
If there's another chance,

341
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
I will definitely prove it to her.

342
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,400
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose it ♫

343
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,300
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose it ♫

344
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,600
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

345
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,530
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

346
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,000
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

347
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,390
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

348
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,000
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

349
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,800
♫ Coincidentally, all insincere ♫

350
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,400
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

351
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,900
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

352
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,000
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

353
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,200
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

354
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,300
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

355
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:45,600
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

356
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

357
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,000
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

358
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,200
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

359
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,400
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

360
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

361
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,000
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

362
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,800
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

363
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,900
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

364
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,600
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

365
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,700
♫ You first get off ♫

366
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,500
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me ♫
