00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,280
- I would like to know more details.
- We want CEO Li to be our model this time.

162
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,410
Miss Luo, how do you think my taste in men is now?

163
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,160
Director Su, what do you think about CEO Li and me together?

164
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,620
- A'Shang.
- Sister Manni.

165
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,340
The clothes are here. Let's pick together.

166
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,750
You can just go pick.

167
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,580
This is the necklace you gave me. Is it pretty?

168
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,930
- Chief Editor Sun.
- Manager Luo.

169
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,400
I heard Ming Xiu is giving Jiasheng and me the front cover.

170
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,370
Jiasheng is usually so busy, but he happened to come to the studio today.

171
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,650
I've decided. Let's shoot for the front cover as well.

172
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,330
Manager Luo. That's only the front cover of the supplement.

173
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,810
- A supplement.
- It's the same!

174
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,250
Okay.

175
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,990
Let's go change.

176
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,050
Let's go.

177
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,710
The tie is crooked.

178
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,620
Let me see on this side.

179
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,160
- Okay.
- It's okay.

180
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,710
- Take it.
- Okay.

181
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,740
Get closer.

182
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,270
Not bad. Not bad.

183
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,160
Look at the camera.

184
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,170
Sister. How about we leave?

185
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,070
Let's do one more.

186
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,450
Go where? The boss hasn't even left.

187
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,580
How can we take action on our own?

188
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,400
Sister, what are you doing?

189
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,690
Next photo.

190
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,720
Good. Get closer.

191
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,830
Director Su, you worked really hard today! You did almost everything by yourself.

192
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,530
People like us who do the heavy work

193
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,720
can't be compared to exquisite people like you, Manager Luo.

194
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,830
You're so courteous, Director Su.

195
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,980
- Sister, I'll do it.
- Okay.

196
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,820
I'll help you.

197
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,060
Su Yi.

198
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,810
Manager Luo just came back from abroad. If she didn't do well enough, please help her.

199
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,140
I think she's quite good.

200
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,080
Just connect with Manager Luo regarding work in the future. You don't have to report to me.

201
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,900
- Okay, CEO Li.
- Also, I am not that full of myself.

202
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,600
Use that Xiang or something to be your model.

203
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,830
It's Xiangtai.

204
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,790
Sister, Sister.

205
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,350
Talk to me.

206
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,760
You didn't discuss with me either.

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,210
I was thinking

208
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,940
that the model company collaborates with Lee Group.

209
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,630
Besides, most of the work is at Lee Group.

210
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,760
I can help you keep an eye on Li Jiasheng that way.

211
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,970
Su Xiangtai, what are you thinking about?

212
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,660
Doesn't it affect your studies by being a model?

213
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,860
Aren't we talking about your problem now?

214
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,480
You said you don't like Li Jiashang.

215
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,910
But you call him even in your dreams.

216
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,340
- I...
- I'll help you vacuum.

217
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,160
Sit down.

218
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,460
Move your feet.

219
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,700
If you have the energy to think nonsense,

220
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,690
then why don't you go date?

221
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,290
You should've told me to not use so much power on my hands before.

222
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,570
My hands are about to fall off.

223
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,630
I'm almost there.

224
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,910
You won't die from killing yourself like this.

225
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,980
Get up.

226
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,430
A wise philosopher once said,

227
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,780
that every grown-up has thought about suicide.

228
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,080
- If you have anything that you're sad about, tell me and let me—
- So you can make me happy.

229
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,350
I won't.

230
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,320
You, Princess Jade Face, have fallen for Bull Demon King.
(T/N: Characters from "Journey to the West", the two had an affair.)

231
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,230
Everyone knows about it.

232
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,540
I'm telling you that I didn't fall in love with him.

233
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,190
I only want to find the truth through him.

234
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,050
But I didn't expect, half way through it, Princess Iron Fan would suddenly show up.
(T/N: Wife of Bull Demon King)

235
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,890
Dragging him back to the Flaming Mountain.

236
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,270
If I look for Li Jiashang now, that will be bypassing his subordinates and going directly to him.

237
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,810
Why don't you...

238
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,600
Why don't you use the trick of endurance?

239
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,950
I can't. That's not my style of being the warrior Hua Mulan.

240
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,240
- Let's do another round.
- I'm with you until the end.

241
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,690
[Lee Group]

242
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,250
- Hello, CEO Li.
- Hello, CEO Li.

243
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,920
Jiasheng, help me pull it off.

244
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,340
Tell me about the ambassador for the new product.

245
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,090
Based on the age of Lee Group's target consumers,

246
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,410
we selected several groups of more influential actors.

247
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,060
We have started to confirm the schedule.

248
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,190
But Ming Xiu doesn't want to use actors for endorsement this time.

249
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,390
According to our survey, a joint cooperation with artists

250
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,270
is more effective.

251
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,480
Director Su, reputable artists

252
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,980
are much more difficult to collaborate with compared to actors.

253
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,100
Are we conducting a business campaign or an art campaign?

254
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,960
The success of a business is also an outstanding art.

255
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,890
These two aren't incompatible.

256
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,780
Director Su, please be more realistic.

257
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,200
It's easier to not fail that way.

258
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,450
I think what Manager Luo said is right.

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,920
If there's nothing else, then the meeting is over.

260
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,010
Why do I like how serious you look in meetings?

261
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,600
I'll go tidy up.

262
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,000
Director Su, please stay.

263
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,900
Is there anything else, CEO Li?

264
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,150
Nothing.

265
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,970
Sorry, CEO Li.

266
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,350
Director Su,

267
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,190
why don't you have lunch with me and Jiashang this afternoon?

268
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,850
Since you invited me,

269
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,480
of course I have to go.

270
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,860
[One Secret]

271
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,170
Hello.

272
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,140
You order. See what you want to eat.

273
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,520
The style of this restaurant

274
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,920
is not bad. It's indeed what I like.

275
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,130
It's been so many years. Your style hasn't changed.

276
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,330
What do you want to drink?

277
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,390
Ginger Sparkling Water.

278
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,050
I also want ginger sparkling water.

279
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,210
Director Su, what do you want to drink?

280
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,090
Lemonade. Thank you.

281
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,600
Try mine. It's medium rare.

282
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,080
You're still so shy.

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,450
Miss Luo, were you guys engaged since you were young?

284
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,350
Yes, we are family friends.

285
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,320
However, I don't like this feudal tradition.

286
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,830
Jiashang and I love each other on our own. Right?

287
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,490
Director Su, I heard that you're Jiashang's rumored girlfriend.

288
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,530
Miss Luo, you've misunderstood.

289
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,480
CEO Li and I are just working partners.

290
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,530
I don't care what your relationship is.

291
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,690
I hope that someone can help me train this blockhead.

292
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,890
I'm sorry. I still have something to do at Ming Xiu. I'll get going.

293
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll send you.

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,970
No need.

295
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,320
CEO Li, you should keep company to your fiancée.

296
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,790
Yiyi.

297
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,680
Since when do you like such strong taste?

298
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,320
Is something going on?

299
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,080
Stop thinking too much. How about going for a run with me?

300
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Let's go. Go, go.

301
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,340
Where are you guys going?

302
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,340
It's women's business. What do you know?

303
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,230
Here. Finish the noodles.

304
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,750
So many red chili peppers.

305
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,980
It's Hunan flavor. Your sister made it herself.

306
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,110
When did my sister become a hot girl?

307
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,480
This is what you meant by running?

308
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,110
You can vent more compared to running.

309
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,020
Give it a try.

310
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,220
Treat it as Luo Manni.

311
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,430
Li Jiashang. Li Jiashang. Hit him.

312
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,890
To be honest, this woman has tactics

313
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,850
and beauty. No one can stand it.

314
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,200
Xia Xiyang, are you taking refuge in the enemy's camp?

315
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,060
Why do I feel like your heart went over there first?

316
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,530
I went near him for the truth.

317
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,740
Did this guy install a radar on my body?

318
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,250
What a coincidence.

319
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,140
Yangyang, did you come to look for me again? I'm afraid that you

320
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,950
- installed a radar on my body.
- installed a radar on my body.

321
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,330
What a coincidence, Director Su. You're also boxing here?

322
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,420
Is it a coincidence? Manager Luo, you're not the only one who likes boxing.

323
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,540
Okay, one round?

324
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,960
Okay.

325
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,660
Forget about it, Manni.

326
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,380
Manni's coach is a retired member of the national team.

327
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,630
I have never met any opponents in the school team in the past.

328
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,240
That's great. I've met a strong competitor. I love it even more.

329
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,200
Don't be too serious. It's just a friendly match.

330
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,620
I know your heart aches for me. Don't worry.

331
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,040
What's the point if we don't take it seriously? What's the bet?

332
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,680
Are you that confident?

333
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,400
Don't worry, I just want to have the rights to the project,

334
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,090
so that I can report to CEO Li directly.

335
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,810
Why do I feel like it's not fighting for the project, but for someone?

336
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,940
You talk too much.

337
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,660
There's a new contemporary artist in Japan who's very suitable for Lee Group's new products.

338
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,120
He is holding a solo exhibition in Ocean City recently. I have faith in getting the copyright authorization from him.

339
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,310
You can talk after you win.

340
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,270
Su Yi! Su Yi! Always number one!

341
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,730
You got this!

342
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,730
You can do it Su Yi!

343
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,850
Su Yi!

344
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Stop!

345
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,250
Enough, let's stop here.

346
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,140
Anyways, I win.

347
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,070
Thanks. You're really amazing, but next time—

348
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,370
You also tried your best.

349
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,520
When you encounter a strong opponent, you will become stronger. You are very brave.

350
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,120
The Japanese artist you are referring to, he must be Murakami.

351
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,130
I advise you to not waste your efforts.

352
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,780
He... isn't that good.

353
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,530
Jiashang, let's go first.

354
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,650
Bye bye.

355
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,630
It's also wrong to be liked by others.

356
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,410
I don't know liked by whom, but I know

357
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,130
you're no way better.

358
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,840
What does this have to do with me? I'm leaving.

359
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,080
Bye bye.

360
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,020
She was actually being easy on you just then.

361
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,470
Let's start tomorrow, teach me how to box.

362
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,840
Even if I teach you for three years, you'll only last for three more seconds.

363
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,390
How are you still so strong now?

364
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,850
When you encounter a strong opponent, you will become stronger.

365
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,040
[Lee Group]

366
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,740
Hello, Sister Su Yi. Good thing I confirmed again.

367
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,500
Manager Luo cancelled our appointment with Teacher Murakami.

368
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,620
Wait there till I come over.

369
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,420
Hello. Where's Manager Luo?

370
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,360
M-Manager Luo is in CEO Li's office.

371
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,410
These photos turned out pretty nice.

372
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,370
Look at your expression.

373
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,800
Each one turned out nice, it's hard to pick.

374
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,280
- Look at this one.
- Manni.

375
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,860
There's no one here. We don't need to be like this.

376
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,730
Then what should we be like?

377
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,910
I've started to imagine how we're going to look on our wedding day.

378
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,230
Let's get married in Italy, okay?

379
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,120
Manni.

380
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,570
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

381
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,700
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

382
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:35,010
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

383
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:42,260
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

384
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,080
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

385
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,860
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

386
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,400
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

387
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,240
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

388
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,140
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

389
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,150
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

390
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:30,290
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

391
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:37,600
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

392
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,480
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

393
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,930
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

394
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,160
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

395
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,470
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

396
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,440
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

397
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,970
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

398
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:11,870
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

399
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,820
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

400
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,660
♫ On the travelling train ♫

401
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,760
♫ You first get off ♫

402
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:31,360
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
