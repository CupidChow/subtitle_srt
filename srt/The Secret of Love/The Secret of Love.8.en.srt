00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,750
- How do you know I did not consider her?
- Is that so?

164
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,000
If you did,

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,620
then why did Mu Xiao leave in the end?

166
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,850
If given another chance,

167
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,470
I would prove it to her.

168
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:13,460
♫  The cold wind can’t tell the time and season  ♫

169
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,000
But I'm not Mu...

170

♫  Looking out the street with warm sun and few people ♫

171
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,020
Okay.

172
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,290
Even if you can prove it,

173
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,480
you can't change the fact that you hurt her before.

174

♫  If the sky isn’t dark, I wouldn’t have discovered  ♫

What is it that you want to say?

176
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,760
I think that there shouldn't be any secrets between us,

177
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,670
but you seem like a complete mystery to me.

178
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,320
I still have work to do, so I'm leaving first.

- Hello, Miss Su.
- Manager Chen.

183
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,860
These are our Lee Group's skin care products that sell the best.

184
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,560
This hand cream is our bestseller.

185
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,110
Compared to expensive face creams and essential oils,

186
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,520
it's still a hand cream with a wider base of consumers and higher sales.

187
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,050
Why didn't I know that you are also responsible for patrolling the shop?

188
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,430
- Hello, CEO Li.
- Hello.

189
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,300
Do I need to report every bit of work I do to you?

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,950
You're deliberately avoiding me.

191
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
You're overthinking this.

192
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,020
In order to obtain the most honest reviews from customers,

193
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,490
I arranged to come here for a visit a week ago.

194
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,800
Since you're here, I might as well ask you a few questions.

195
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,980
If Lee Group's new sub-brand does not have the brand premiums like the luxury items,

196
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,220
in the young market where consumers value price-performance,

197
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,700
are you not afraid of losing your advantage?

198
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,520
I'm not afraid. Besides, the promotional campaign for the new products

199
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,660
has been handed over to you.

200
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,990
Miss Su, this hand cream is a repairing moisturizer.

201
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,080
And this sunscreen has four effects of exfoliation. Try it.

202
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,790
Let me do it.

203
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,970
Your hand.

204
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,620
I'll do it myself.

205
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,200
It's not a tacky floral scent. It's the scent of wood plants that I like.

206
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,440
It's the scent you like.

207
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,080
Manager Chen, can we take a look at the makeup section?

208
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,560
Of course, this way please, Miss Su.

209
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,200
This way please, Miss Su.

210
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,450
This lipstick has been a big hit.

211
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,880
CEO Li came up with the name.

212
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,110
"Lobster".

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Is it because the color resembles a cooked lobster?

214
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,880
Or is it because you like crawfish?
(T/N: crawfish also means back out of something or retreat)

215
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,190
Lobsters symbolize love and companionship abroad.

216
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,880
Because when lobsters grow old,

217
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,080
they stroll holding hands under the sea.

218
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,030
So in terms of relationships, lobsters have become the synonym for steadfastness and loyalty.

219
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,580
Who would have thought you were so romantic?

220
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,960
Can the market accept such a convoluted explanation though?

221
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,970
That's why we keep brainwashing the straight men in our marketing.

222
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,640
When you don't know what to give your lover, you can gift this.

223
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,120
It's not brilliant, but it won't go wrong.

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,740
It turned out to be a big hit.

225
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,920
[Lobster Color ¥1,388 ($214)]

226
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,540
It's not cheap either.

227
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,270
If you like it, I can give you a set.

228
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,810
No need. If I like it, I'll buy it myself.

229
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,190
Can you get her a set? Remember the employee discount of 15% off.

230
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,780
Sure, CEO Li.

231
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,390
You're really not shy.

232
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,420
Of course.

233
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,190
After all, I want our Director Su to be satisfied.

234
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,590
Then can I borrow your hands for something?

235
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,520
CEO Li, the hands of a man

236
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,380
are like a second face.

237
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,500
CEO Li, your skin is fair. You look good in any color.

238
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,360
When a woman applies this bright red color, they look bold and direct.

239
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,080
- Let me have a bottle then.
- All right.

240
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,180
What did you want to say to me just now?

241
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,240
Do you really want to know?

242
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,910
Of course.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,320
Scientists have found that it is impossible for lobsters to have only one mate for life.

244
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,250
And it's also impossible for them to be holding hands underwater when they are old like you said.

245
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,640
These are all lies from "Friends" (TV Show Series).

246
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,820
Lobsters are like most animals in the world,

247
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,860
they can only find love with great strength.

248
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,350
CEO Li, I will create a summary proposal based on today's offline research,

249
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,490
putting an emphasis on the advantage development for the new sub-brand.

250
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,980
I'm really at ease with letting you handle the new products.

251
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,510
Then you should think carefully about how to keep me.

252
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,650
There are many employers poaching me.

253
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,330
President Chu, have you arrived?

254
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,120
Just a moment, I'll immediately—

255
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,300
What? Why aren't we meeting anymore?

256
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Right, I regret this. I shouldn't have helped you before.

257
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,430
I've already gone to see Zhu Yue.

258
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,800
Tell me, did I die in that car accident?

259
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,950
No matter what, don't meddle with this anymore. Did you hear me?

260
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,240
Did someone threaten you?

261
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,700
No.

262
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,770
Is it Li Jiashang? At least answer this. Is it him?

263
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,310
I haven't even met Li Jiashang after coming back.

264
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,550
Su Yi, have you still not realized how Li Jiashang feels about you?

265
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,560
Have you ever considered that, if you continue investigating,

266
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,710
you might have to choose between love and the truth? Will you have the courage to face this possibility?

267
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,620
Perhaps, you don't understand now, but as someone who experienced it,

268
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,950
this kind of decision is very painful. Su Yi, this is for your own good.

269
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,620
For my own good? Why don't you just admit that you're scared?

270
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,660
Drive.

271
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,990
What's up?

272
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,110
Chu Mo went to One Secret, was it for...

273
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,100
Why did you go see Chu Mo that day?

274
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,110
I had something for him that day, but he didn't manage the company at all.

275
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,520
So I met up directly with Sun Meng. I didn't see him.

276
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,340
It's that time at the One Secret Bar?

277
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,310
I saw everything.

278
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,470
He just came back from abroad, so I was greeting him.

279
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,170
Indeed. Did you threaten him,

280
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,930
and make him avoid me by taking unnecessary overseas trips and business trips?

281
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,990
- You're suspicious of me.
- Otherwise, how would you explain?

282
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,150
I explain?

283
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,300
Su Yi, it was you who got close to me,

284
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,860
tricked me step by step.

285
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,420
Could you please first explain to me,

286
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,020
why are you searching for Chu Mo now? And why do you suspect me?

287
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,680
I don't have to answer.

288
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,970
Mr. driver, please follow that car ahead.

289
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,500
Both Lee Group and Ming Xiu did not arrange for Chu Mo to go abroad. It's probably a personal trip.

290
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,810
Faster, please.

291
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,040
But I found out that someone is stalking Su Yi. Be careful.

292
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,870
This is Chu Mo. I'm changing my mind.

293
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,930
Let's meet up.

294
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
Mr. driver, we will go to North Longkun Road instead.

295
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,560
Sure thing.

296
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,180
Su Yi, what are you hiding?

297
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,640
Miss, it'll get darker if we keep going ahead.

298
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,790
You're on your own, so be careful.

299
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,640
Here.

300
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
A knife? What's that for?

301
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,410
You always come home late. Carry something to protect yourself.

302
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,080
Take this.

303
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,910
There's no need.

304
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,290
Safety first.

306
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,890
Why did she come here?

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,150
Hello, the number you are dialing is unavailable.

I'm scared of losing you again, like seven years ago.

I'm so scared of losing you.

Why are you still refusing to admit it?

Why did you come here late at night? Answer me.

316
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,810
I don't want to say.

317
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,370
Do you know there was someone following you just now?

318
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,190
Following me? Besides you, I haven't seen anyone else.

319

Answer me. Who sent you here?

It has nothing to do with you.

321
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,090
It has nothing to do with me? If it wasn't for me, tonight you would have got into trouble, you know that?

322
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,890
Su Yi, could you please use your brain a little before you do something?

323
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,420
Why do you always have to make the ones around you worry for you?

324
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,060
It used to be like that seven years ago, and it's the same now!

325
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,960
Why?

326
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,830
Do you even know what you are saying?

327
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,440
I hope you don't misunderstand our relationship. You are no one to me.

328
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,540
I also don't want you to meddle with me. Even if I was to die here today,

329
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,110
this still has nothing to do with you.

330
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,920
Su Yi.

331
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,780
♫  The cold wind can’t tell the time and season  ♫

332
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,530
♫  Looking out the street with warm sun and few people ♫

333
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:01,500
♫  Forget how many days not socializing with people  ♫

334
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,110
♫  If the sky isn’t dark, I wouldn’t have discovered  ♫

335
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,350
A big man like you can't stand this little pain! Bear it a little!

336
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:18,360
He's talking to you. You can't stand this little pain! What are you yelling so loudly for?

337
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,130
Endure it. You pinched me so hard that my skin is reddened.

338
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,440
Say, you can't completely blame her.

339
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,070
She dreads Lee Group, and she can't completely trust you,

340
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,560
so she's hiding her identity and motive, pretending to not know you.

341
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,910
But does she not remember anything before and after the car accident?

342
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,010
- What did you tell her later?
- What did I tell her?

343
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,000
I told her that I think Lee Group harmed her father?

344
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,050
I-I went to go find Chu Mo for the information?

345
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,500
I went to the psychiatric hospital to find Zhu Yue? How do I tell her that?

346
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,870
Doctor, we have a friend that's a screenwriter.

347
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,160
We're practicing the lines. Don't take it to heart.

348
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,700
What are you going to do in the future?

349
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,970
Sis, why are you back just now? I got your package.

350
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,600
Help me open it.

351
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Okay.

352
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,250
Here.

353
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,930
I didn't buy anything.

354
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,180
[Lobster]

355
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,260
Lipsticks?

356
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,770
Lobsters symbolize love and companionship abroad.

357
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,840
Because when lobsters grow old, they stroll holding hands under the sea.

358
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,200
I don't want them. You can have them.

359
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
Why would I use lipsticks?

360
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,370
To improve your complexion.

361
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,420
Did you get home?

362
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,090
♫ Using the loneliness to gaze at happiness ♫

363
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,370
How's your hand? Did you bandage it?

364
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,610
♫ Treat regret as a kind of possession ♫

365
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,040
♫ You are my last unspeakable impulse  ♫

366
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,600
CEO Li, in the future don't...

367
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,980
♫ Planting the blue dream in the stars ♫

368
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:06,810
♫ Let the weightless heart carry all the restless beats ♫

369
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:14,020
♫ At the end of the road, are you still waiting for me? ♫

370
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,710
Okay, I know.

371
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,060
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

372
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:44,080
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

373
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,560
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

374
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:57,950
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

375
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,620
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

376
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:12,360
♫ Coincidentally, all insincere ♫

377
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,010
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

378
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:24,450
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

379
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,570
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

380
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:39,740
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

381
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,950
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

382
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:53,190
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

383
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:00,020
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

384
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,550
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

385
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,720
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

386
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,000
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

387
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,060
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

388
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,470
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

389
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:27,410
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

390
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:33,460
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

391
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,210
♫ On the travelling train ♫

392
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,290
♫ You first get off ♫

393
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:47,430
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
