Miss Su, is there anything that can't be said at the office?

15
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,930
It's a personal matter.

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,010
Could it be that you want to help me with getting my nephew to acknowledge me as his uncle?

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,410
It can be considered so.

I have been remembering many things from my past.

Such a major event happened with Jiashang's family.

27

Why didn't you tell me?

28

You didn't even tell me about the burial.

There was some furniture that was still usable.

I didn't expect to see some other items too.

From the start,

I regarded you as a laboratory specimen, but gradually,

I don't remember anything at all.

123
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,430
I said that I regained my memories. It was to force Gao Mu.

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,440
No. I don't believe it. I don't believe it!

125
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,080
Do you know there is a kind of person in this world

126
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,950
who, even if you don't force him, does everything?

127
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,150
He was the first to suggest using you

128

When Mu Feng wanted to take you away from here,

he was the one who caught you too.

132

In desperation to cause you to lose your memories,

133
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,800
he even left

134
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,620
a beautiful scar on your jaw.

135
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,250
That was to let you believe that you were really in the car accident.

However,

137

as the specimen for the experiment,

155
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,140
However, Comrade Zhang said you won't be able to remember anything.

156
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,330
That's why I let you live.

Is Director Zheng's case related to you?

159

words of encouragement to him.

161
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,720
If what you did in the past,

163
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,250

Do you think I will still believe whatever you say?

168
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,490
When I was young I constantly made mistakes and

169
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,820
I would get beaten up.

170
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,460
After that, I used to find a high place

171
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,460
and convince myself to jump off.

172
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,480
Because I knew I was just an obsolete person.

173
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,840
I didn't have friends. Hence, everyone regarded me

174
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,650
as transparent.

175
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,970
Later, I went to the research institute to become an assistant.

176
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,750
There was someone. She said,

177
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,120
"Xiao Gao, bring me my meal".

178
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,820
"Thank you. Xiao Gao,

179
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,310
heat up my beaker".

180
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,290
Whatever she said,

181
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,270
it sounded so good.

182
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,740
But,

183
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,010
she didn't want to be with me.

184
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,430
She basically didn't want to remember me.

185
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,880
So, I became the specimen for the experiment

186
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,780
because I'm Xiao Han's daughter?

187
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,860
That's right.

188
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,930
I couldn't let her forget me.

189
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,000
Comrade Zhang said he had a solution. But such a major surgery,

190
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,560
I couldn't let her undergo that.

191
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,340
Fortunately, there was you.

192
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,950
But why? Mu Feng was no longer alive.

193
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,860
She still wanted to leave with him too.

194
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,890
Why? After the surgery, she would remember me.

195
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,090
We could then be together forever.

196
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,180
Loving someone,

197
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,560
is this how it feels?

198
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,110
Lunatic.

199
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,930
You are unworthy of even mentioning love.

200
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,370
I'm asking about Li Jiashang.

201
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,550
Stop!

202
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,850
What do you want?

203
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
Let me think.

204
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,430
I seem to have everything.

205
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,160
Release her. I'll do it.

206
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,390
I absolutely detest your derogatory face.

207
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,580
Do you think you are that great?

208
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,310
Everyone likes and praises you,

209
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,540
and places hopes on you.

210
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,040
It's really enough.

211
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,920
Are you here just to show how much of a failure I am in life?

212
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm the one you hate. Release her.

213
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,040
It's not fun.

214
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,590
I want you to experience it too.

215
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,150
The feeling of your beloved one

216
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,620
dying slowly in front of your eyes.

217
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,820
Zheng He?

218
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,090
Are you crazy? What benefits did Gao Mu give you?

219
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,280
Benefits?

220
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,630
Am I that vulgar to you?

221
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,500
Previously at the wine bar,

222
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,880
you threatened me because of Su Yi. Do you still remember?

223
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,570
Zheng He, stay calm.

224
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,660
From that day on, you are not fit to be my friend anymore.

225
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,820
Do you love her that much?

226
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,160
Come, I will let you see more of her.

227
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,350
Look!

228
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,490
Zheng He, Gao Mu deceived you.

229
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,860
- In fact, your father...
- Shut up!

230
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,710
Do you think I will trust you again?

231
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,700
Why don't we change the game?

232
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,120
I will count to three and let them die together.

233
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,710
This is a good game.

234
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,380
It has more of a sense of ritual.

235
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,910
One...

236
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,890
Two...

237
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,750
Two...

238
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,090
Three!

239
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,050
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

240
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:23,250
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

241
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,600
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

242
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,990
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

243
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,590
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

244
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:51,390
♫ Coincidentally, all insincere ♫

245
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,990
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

246
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:03,960
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

247
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:11,570
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

248
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,830
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

249
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,920
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

250
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:32,170
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

251
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:39,020
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

252
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,550
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

253
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,820
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

254
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,050
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

255
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,120
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

256
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,580
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

257
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing I was disqualified by loving too much ♫

258
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,440
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

259
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,230
♫ On the traveling train ♫

260
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,360
♫ You first get off ♫

261
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,290
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me ♫
