It's okay. It's what I should do.

The doctor said you underwent craniotomy. It's normal to sleep after agitation.

You may sleep for a longer time

or perhaps, wake up soon.

32

It's also good to sleep for a longer time. You were exhausted.

Gao Mu installed a surveillance camera in Zheng Yi's office.

You don't need to tell me this. This is my personal matter.

46

Su Yi, even if there are some hidden matters, it's still my personal problem.

160
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,060
Negative emotions can affect prenatal education.

161
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,820
Tell the truth.

162
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,530
Anyway, we registered our marriage on the way to buy groceries.

163
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,990
But it's great. It's very meaningful.

164
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,660
Marriage is accepting the flaws of one another and letting us become better persons.

165
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,520
Wifey, what you said is very deep.

166
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,110
When we got the certificate, Su Yi told me that in her text.

167
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,090
That's what I thought.

168
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,670
Then why don't you get married too?

169
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,180
Let's get married then.

170
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,230
My God. Sis, you...

171
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,730
It's the customized jewelry shop that I recommended.

172
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
Don't be elated.

173
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,580
I merely want to officially freeload off you.

174
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,880
Before I change my mind, aren't you going to put it on me now?

175
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,180
Freeloading? No problem. It's free for life.

Okay. Cheers!

- What's wrong, Yangyang?

184
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,180
Hubby, it seems like I'm giving birth soon.

- What are you doing? Take her to the hospital now!

- Quick!
- Be careful.

190
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,500
Be gentle.

191
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
It's complimentary to display your work.

192
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
We'll organize regular exhibitions, as well as provide media resources.

193
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,900
This is my original intention of establishing the shop. I want to build a face-to-face communication platform for everyone.

194
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,300
Teacher Su, with your ability, you could have collaborated with more mature artists.

195
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,900
Why did you choose us?

196
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
Compared to more renowned artists,

197
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
I prefer to grow together with young artists.

198
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,900
I feel that the most valuable thing is shared memory.

199
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,400
It's just like a contract, worthy of trust.

200
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Teacher Su's practice is also a form of performance arts.

201
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,600
The waiter here is very handsome.

202
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
He is complimentary too.

203
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Cut down on alcohol. Drink more tea.

204
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,400
Teacher Su is already married, and she's still so charming.

205
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
We won't disturb you then.

206
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,100
Let's keep in contact.

207
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,120
Being with me like this, aren't you afraid that your husband will find out?

208
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,360
After being with him for a long time, I should look for some excitement.

209
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
What kind of excitement do you want?

210

You are basically alone. What's wrong with using you to avoid the paparazzi?

214
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
Do you know you are very rude being like this?

215
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
If it was someone else, he would be very honored.

216
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm not someone else.

Yes. You are not someone else.

He inherited the rascal traits of Zheng He.

237

He inherited the savage and unreasonable traits of Xia Xiyang.

238
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,500
He's a kid. Don't scare him.

239

I'm not eating. It's too fattening.

240

If you don't eat till you are full, how will you have the strength to give birth?

241
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,920
I will eat. It's most important that I eat till I'm full.

242
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,200
In the past, everyone would say that

this is the wife of Chairman Li from Lee Group.

Now everyone is saying that

this is the husband of Teacher Su, the driving force for arts.

Seems like I should keep some secrets.

What secret would you still have?

248

Do you still remember what's written in Father's diary?

249
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,400
When you were young, you injured the head of a male student.

250
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,100
You even made him call you Brother Mu.

251

Seems like there was something like that.
