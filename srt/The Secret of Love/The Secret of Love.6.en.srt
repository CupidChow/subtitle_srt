[The Secret of Love]

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,510
[Episode 6]

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,140
What are you doing?

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,950
Director Su, you wouldn't think such an important place

16
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,710
would have zero protection?

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,720
I was just passing by and looked at it. Can't I do that?

18
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,190
You punched in the wrong passcode three times. How do you explain that?

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,110
So, CEO Li, what do you want to do?

20
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,400
Prying on the company secret, I can call the police to arrest you.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,080
You want to arrest me? No problem.

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,670
But the Lee Group has done many unusual things back then,

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,790
including the Li Mu Research Institute that you were referring to.

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,910
I have reasons to believe that the truth is hidden behind there.

25
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,110
- CEO Li, have you thought about how to explain that to the police?
- Reasons are not evidence.

26
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,680
I can also sue you for defamation.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,770
Also, there is nothing here that Director Su wants to know,

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,480
but there is something that Mu Xiao wants to know.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you still want to see it?

30
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,330
Why are you here, Sanbao?

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,300
I waited so long for you.

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,830
A'Shang, grant me a leave for next Thursday?

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,420
No.

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,920
Don't take out your anger on me.

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,600
If you're not here, I'm not used to it.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,930
Do you really not remember what day is next Thursday?

37
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,150
I remember, next Thursday I have a checkup.

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,840
Thank you, go back early.

39

[Yangyang]

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,640
Yangyang, do you have time next Thursday?

41
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,180
The passcode must be incorrect.

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,280
I have to get Li Jiashang's fingerprint.

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,510
Isn't that easy? Find a corner,

44
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,660
raise your arm, lower the knife.

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,720
If we don't want to see any blood,

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,450
do you have any other ideas?

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,830
This... this really is difficult.

48
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,080
Here, have a taste.

49
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,330
Can fingerprints stay on the smooth side of the glass?

50
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,430
Then use tape to get it off, and make it into a fingerprint film.

51
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,430
Let me think about how to get close to him.

52
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,150
It is best if we are not alone.

53
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,000
Isn't that easy? Go find him at the Lee Group directly.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,380
Under what name?

55
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,250
Yangyang, do you have time for my birthday next Thursday?

56
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,880
Why is he calling you Yangyang?

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,050
This is not important. What's important is

58
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,910
Zheng He's birthday. Li Jiashang will definitely come.

59
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,660
We only need to be prepared in advance.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,090
Then it will be really easy to get the fingerprint.

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,090
But Zheng He to you—

62
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,880
I don't care. For you,

63
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,520
I can "go up the mountain of knives and down the ocean of fire".

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,750
You are the best.

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,970
It's your fault for being my most beloved Yiyi.

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,840
Yang'er, where are you?

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,480
Hurry, hurry up.

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,680
- There really are people! B-Brother!
- Where are the people?

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
- There's nobody.
- Are you blind? Am I not a person?

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,440
Go to a smaller room.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,490
The way you say things is interesting.

72
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,450
What do you mean interesting? Do you not understand what it means?

73
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,530
B-B-Brother, nothing interesting.

74
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,230
Brother, your mala (spicy) crawfish tattoo

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,800
is quite unique.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Let go of him!

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,350
Girl, you are quite pretty. How about you have a drink with me?

78
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,290
Girl my foot!

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,650
You dare to fight with me?!

80
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,600
Are you capable? Don't you practice boxing all the time?

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,910
I practice boxing to protect you, not to fight.

82
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,260
Let go!

83
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,100
- What is it?
- Sit over there!

84
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,640
Sit over there!

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Come, come, come.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,100
Where's Li Jiashang? Why is it just us three?

88
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,690
I didn't invite him.

89
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,890
He is so ungrateful, I won't invite him.

90
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,580
- But if he doesn't...
- Look,

91
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,810
you celebrate your birthday according to the lunar calendar, it changes every year.

92
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,520
How can a normal person remember?

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,890
Besides, it is also on April Fool's day, everyone will think you are lying.

94
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,160
So do you want to explain to Li Jiashang?

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,820
Are you really okay that he's not coming?

96
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,450
Why should I explain to him? Of course, I'm okay!

97
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,590
As long as Yangyang is here, then it's fine.

98
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,250
You really forget your friend after seeing beautiful girls.

99
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,830
See, I told you he was on the way.

100
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,850
- Happy Birthday!
- Where's my present?

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,730
I am the biggest present.

102
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay! I announce

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,210
my birthday party,

104
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,560
begins right now.

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,120
- Let's go!
- Cheers.

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,840
The first move, switching it out.

107
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,210
I will put the special glass in my bag,

108
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,530
then I will find a chance to switch it out

109
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,480
with Li Jiashang's glass.

110
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,750
- What are you doing?
- I was going to the restroom, then the alcohol arrived.

111
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,640
Let's go together.

112
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,460
Find a way for him to apply some lotion.

113
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,240
That way, the fingerprint will be more evident.

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,050
CEO Li.

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,560
Men's hands are also their second face.

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,620
The second move is to take advantage when they are weak.

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,850
Get Li Jiashang drunk, while he is not prepared,

118
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,320
repeat the first move.

119
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,670
Here, let's toast to our birthday boy!

120
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,420
Here, here, cheers!

121
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,040
Thank you.

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,610
I am driving, I cannot drink alcohol.

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,840
No, you should show some respect to Zheng He.

124
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,450
It's okay, we are real friends, I don't care about that.

125
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,290
Then how about this? Let's play a game.

126
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,330
The person who loses has to drink. CEO Li, do you dare?

127
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,670
I will drink it.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,200
One, two, three.

129
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,700
Yang–

130
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,980
You have to be conscious.

131
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,230
What happens if Li Jiashang does not lose?

132
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,270
The third move, quarrel between brothers.

133
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't bully girls.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,300
You are a girl?

135
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,520
Yes, you are. You are. Everything is girly.

136
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
A'Shang, you are not drinking a single sip, I can't take it anymore.

137
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,570
How about this?

138
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,690
You too have a game.

139
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,680
- Is it okay, CEO Li?
- Let me see.

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,980
The fourth move, secretly taking action.

141
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,200
Spin ten times where you are standing. Whoever captures first, wins.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,090
Three, two, one, spin! Go!

143
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,620
- Where?
- As long as we don't get drunk,

144
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,720
we have to make him lose even by cheating.

145
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,920
I won!

146
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,420
CEO Li, your alcohol.

147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,520
Drink it!

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,170
I will help him drink it.

149
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,210
Why do you keep drinking for him?

150
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,110
If he does not drink, then we'll play truth or dare.

151
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,400
So the fifth move, defeating the opponent with a surprise move.

152
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,900
Truth or dare! Truth or dare!

153
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,780
Truth or dare!

154
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,990
- What truth?
- How do we dare?

155
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,530
Then how about you two—

156
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,200
You two,

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,530
french kiss for ten seconds.

158
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,110
Stop messing around!

159
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,750
How would that be possible?!

160
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,160
Yangyang, Yangyang.

161
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,020
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

162
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,170
What is wrong, miss? Has something happened?

163

Has something happened? What has happened?

It's okay. Thank you.

What's going on? You want to go to the restroom again?

Why are you following me?

You're a bit weird today.

What? Was there a day I wasn't weird in your eyes?

170
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,460
But today you are unusually weird.

Really?

Yangyang, this was the best birthday of my life!

Tell me,

do you like me?

177

No, you just kissed someone else.

178

You're dirty.

179

If you still dare to drink that much when I am not around, I'll break your legs.

Calm down. I wouldn't want her even if you force her on me.

How much did you drink that you are throwing up like this?

188
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,230
- Don't mind me!
- Which floor do you live on? I will bring you back.

189
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,570
You go back.

It's nothing.

No way! What if you fall asleep in the elevator?

194
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,630
I am warning you! Even though my body is drunk,

Don't worry! You can count on me!

You even took the initiative to date me.

You have been rather quiet lately.

248
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,350
You told me to stop pestering you. How could I not listen to you?

- You even listened to this?
- What did you say?

250
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,350
No. I'm saying that I was drunk previously.

251
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,990
I kind of lost control of my strength.

252
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,230
Lost control? The strength was just right. It's fine even if you exert more force.

253
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,430
After all, I have thick skin.

254

Fine. I accept it.

when I was in my youth, I always dragged Su Yi here?

259
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,380
I'm probably under stress lately.

260
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,650
Hence, I wanted to come here for a walk.

Of course not. It only became a jogging path two years ago.

It wasn't that clean in the past. There were some open-air eateries.

Su Yi is really... she likes to eat way more than me.

270

319
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,790
I can't figure out Su Yi...

320
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,580
or I should say Mu Xiao's intention.

321
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,890
Why is she hiding?

322
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,800
Why did she choose to have you reveal this information to me at this point in time?

323
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,130
Why are you annoyed? She's at Ming Xiu,

324
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,110
why don't we just call her over to confirm her identity?

325
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,760
Hey Director Su, are you free?

326
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,600
About our contract for the new proposal,

327
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,800
yes, CEO Li just happens to be free right now. Why don't we just hurry up and get it signed?

328
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,440
Oh, you're not available? Then just have a coworker come instead.

329
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,430
Oh, you'll personally come?

330
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,190
Okay. Then we'll wait here.

331
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
How are you able to stay so composed?

332
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,230
Do you have anything else? If not, leave.

333
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,390
Can't I just rest here for a couple of minutes?

334
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,700
Maybe I really am just your errand boy.

335
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Go.

336
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,480
Good, good, I got it.

337
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,150
Thank you.

338
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,140
- Xiao Wang.
- Yes?
- Has the contract for our new project with Lee Group been finalized?

339
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,760
It's done.

340
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,660
This is the first time I've seen Lee Group in such a hurry.

341
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,600
The earlier they sign, the earlier we get paid. What's bad about that?

342
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,930
This wine looks expensive.

343
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,980
It's for our client, so of course we need to pay a bit more.

344
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,850
The alcohol content is high, too. Director Su, don't drink too fast.

345
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,490
Don't worry.

346
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,660
Even the door is automatic. So lazy.

347
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,060
Should we get a robot to spoon-feed you too?

348
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,640
CEO Li.

349
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,740
CEO Li, the lights in your house...

350
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,440
Turn on the lights.

351
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,430
- I brought the contract.
- Turn off the lights.

352
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,000
Turn on the lights.

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,450
Ming Xiu has already signed off on it, so now it just needs your signature.

354
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,070
The lights are impressive, aren't they?

355
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,770
They're very... intelligent.

356
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,680
Only these kinds of smart tech lights are good enough for me.

357
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,070
CEO Li, you're absolutely right.

358
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,810
[Li Jiashang]

359
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,910
Thank you.

360
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,040
To celebrate our collaboration, let's have a drink.

361
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,040
We haven't even eaten. Why drink?

362
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,540
Okay. Then I'll make something for us.

363
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,110
What are you doing?

364
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,990
Um, where do you keep your noodles?

365
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,950
I also can't turn on the stove.

366
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,260
I don't have fuel-gas, and I don't eat noodles.

367
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,970
Go outside and wait. I'll cook.

368
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,410
I never expected that CEO Li would be such a good cook.

369
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,770
Please, call me Jiashang.

370
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,430
I'm used to living alone, so I've learned a few dishes here and there.

371
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,880
Busy as you are, why don't you hire someone to cook for you?

372
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,260
I don't like having outsiders in my home.

373
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,230
Director Su, you lived in Japan by yourself for so many years.

374
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,080
It must've been hard.

375
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,340
I had Xiangtai and Yangyang, so it wasn't that bad.

376
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,110
I get it.

377
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,600
The things that bind a person tightly to another.

378
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,850
She was the only person I let into my heart.

379
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,640
Even after her car accident, I still comforted myself with the thought

380
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,970
that I could use Lee Group to keep looking for her.

381
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,550
If I ever made things difficult for you before,

382
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,250
I sincerely apologize.

383
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,540
If you really do find her, what will you do?

384
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,560
I won't let her leave me again.

385
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,430
What if she doesn't want that?

386
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,730
No matter what she chooses, I won't let her leave me again.

Then how long do you think you can keep waiting like this?

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,940

Three months? Five years? Or a lifetime?

I think it would be a lifetime for me.

398
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,440
Director Su, do you have anyone you like?

399
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,500
"You". Is he referring to Mu Xiao, or Su Yi?

400
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,080
Excuse me. That's your own private matter. I shouldn't be asking.

I'll pour you a glass of water.

Tell her to answer her phone, I've been worried sick. I'm coming to pick her up now.

Don't, your sister, she's...

409
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,160
too tired, so she fell asleep. Her phone's on silent.

410

Silently following the prey.

Felidae animals...

412
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,990
Thankfully, the wound's not deep. Just a simple patch-up will do.

413
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,760
This is simple?
