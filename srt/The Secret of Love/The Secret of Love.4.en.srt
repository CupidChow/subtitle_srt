What a fellow! Are CEO Li and Su Yi compatible?

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,100
Quickly!

The crowd of reporters that gathered early this morning still haven't left.

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,300
and your grandfather hears about this, then I'm afraid–

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Feilin, I really can't leave right now.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,600
In a minute, when Li Jiashang comes down and walks to his car, rush to him quickly, okay?

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
What if he doesn't hug me?

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Of course, he won't hug you! Aren't you going to initiate the hug?

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,000
As soon as you see him, rush to him. Kiss him, touch him, anything is fine.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Create any kind of physical contact with him, okay?

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Then I can take the picture! You understand?

Do you even want to make money?

30

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,300
About hindering my interviewing last time,

33
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,600
Tao Feilin told you to do it, right?

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Tao Feilin? Who's that? I don't know her.

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Stop acting. There is a photo of the two of you together in your wallet.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,900
Impossible! My photo with her is here—

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,240
Today, she instigated you again?

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Tao Feilin likes Li Jiashang, right?

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,500
And you like her?

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,610
I just want her to give up.

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
How about this?

42
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,900
If you don't want Tao Feilin to find out about what happened today,

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,300
you help me with one thing.

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,000
The last compensatory payment was not a small amount.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
The circulating capital is hard pressed.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,600
It seems that this will decrease investment into supply.

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
As of now,

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
- the only problem is—
- There is a lack of supply of raw material.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,600
Absolutely right. Lin Zi Group took most of the raw materials.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,500
The most they can give us is 20 percent of the shipment.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,600
Lin Zi Group, as a major cosmetics company for young people,

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,300
it's normal for them to play some tricks on the materials supply.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,100
In any case, strive for increasing the raw materials supply once more.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,000
By whatever means you use. This cannot affect our first batch of production.

55

You don't need to worry about funding. I'll take care of it.

56

Getting close to Li Jiashang is very important to me, you must not drop the ball.

They are professional acrobatic fighting stunt doubles, I guarantee it'll look real.

60

Then when is Li Jiashang coming down?

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
According to my informer,

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,200
if nothing especially important comes up, he should be down soon.

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Then you should hurry your people.

64

What? You're not here yet?!

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,200
In a minute, when Li Jiashang comes down, start hitting him once you spot him.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
But remember to be gentle. You must not actually hit him.

- No, you—
- Let me run through the scene first.

And then, when the fight becomes unstoppable,

No. I say. Why do you keep coming?

It's the same for him. It's just more troublesome.

I can't have bodyguards with me everyday.

181

I will find someone to beat him up too.

- Change.

How many relationships have you been in?

Sorry, CEO Li. I forgot to start the recording.

260
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,190
My parents passed away early, so I don't know what their biggest expectation was.

261
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,820
The most tragic thing was losing the most important person.

262
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,410
Relationship, once.

263
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,160
My biggest wish

264
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,130
is for her to return.

265
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,540

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,440

Acting like this will give adults a lot of stress.

288
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,020
Also, your relationship with your sister exceeds the boundaries that siblings should have.

Big sister, come quickly.

297
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,210
- It smells so good.
- That's right.

298
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,690
Big sister, men actually understand men the most.

299
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,850
Let me tell you, no men are good!

300
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,610
That's in their genes.

Is our little Xiangtai like that too?

302

I'm definitely not.

303
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,120
At least not towards you.

Okay, okay.

I knows that you care for me the most.

308
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,000
But who knows when you will bring home a sister-in-law, and show filial respect to me together.

309
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,420
Give up on that wish.

310

You won't have a sister-in-law.

311

Could it be... that you actually like...

They are old buddies who have been with me for decades.

322
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,000
I was attacked by a group of men in my own parkade two days ago?

323
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
What?

324
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,190
Who would dare do such a thing?

325
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,680
How do you plan to deal with it?

326
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,170
It depends on what you think.

327
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,080
By doing this, Old Zhang has really gone to the extreme.

328
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,100
However, after all...

329
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,540
Seems like you still don't want to bring this into the light.

330
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,150
I can promise you that but, from now on,

331
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,270
you can't interfere in my decisions at Lee Group.

332
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,380
I've already given you full authority regarding the company matters.

333
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,870
But you need to remember

334
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,050
that everything must be done in the full interests of Lee Group.

335
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,090
Don't be confused by those young girls.
