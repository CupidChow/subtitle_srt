00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,510
First, use gossip regarding relationships to change the topic

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,370
and then wait for a new topic to come. Naturally, it'll pass by.

Why did I resign? Isn't this what Lee Group wants?

134
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,680
Resigning is such a big issue. Why didn't you discuss it with me and decided on your own?

135
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,390
If I didn't resign, would Lee Group have a better solution?

You don't even need to make a sacrifice regarding this.

I'm not sacrificing myself, I'm protecting myself.

We're talking. How come you're always everywhere?

Where were you when Su Yi was bullied by your grandpa?

145
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,430
You're just a big-tailed wolf.

146

I'm looking for you because Jiashang has some words that are awkward for him to say to you.

If you sign it, it'll only be good to you , no harm.

I understand the methods that you are using.

Lee Group's stocks have dropped to their lowest ever and have affected the group's foundation.

150
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,310
You started this, the executioner better undo what she's done.

151
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,970
You wouldn't want to put Jiashang in a difficult position.

152
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,500
If you have any requirements, feel free to mention them.

153
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,490
In your eyes, Chairman,

154
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,100
Jiashang's life is also a bargaining chip, right?

155
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,080
In my eyes, you're a smart girl.

You probably won't disappoint me.

I didn't really know that Grandpa looked for you.

158

I understand, otherwise, it wouldn't just be kicking you once.

It's been hard for you during this time.

CEO Li doesn't know that the person he just thanked—

322
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,180
She's right here!

323
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,420
She's right here?

324
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,430
Who?

325
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,330
Where is she?

326
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,820
What?

327
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,790
What?

328
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,270
How do you still have the face to come?

329
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,380
Do you still feel like you haven't caused enough trouble for Ming Xiu and Lee Group?

330
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,120
You've already resigned, but you still won't stop.

331
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,960
Are you done?

332
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,790
Quickly take photos.

333
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,850
- Hurry and take it.
- She's actually here.

334
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,330
Stop taking photos.

335
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,890
That's right.

336
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,320
You can't stay here any longer now?

337
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,480
Follow her.

338
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,200
Let's go see.

339
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,720
Where did she go?

340
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,520
[Secret New Product Launch Conference]

341
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,360
Everyone.

342
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,850
Thank you for your attention on me all these days.

343
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,230
I read all the comments.

344
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,560
I think they're right.

345
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,030
Facing their real self

346
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,450
is the attitude that one should have in their life.

347
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,960
Is that real? Take a photo.

348
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,460
That's right.

349
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,290
This scar used to be my secret,

350
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,520
but today I want to say

351
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,390
it's just one of my features.

352
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,620
This bravery and confidence is also what the new product of Lee Group's Secret Series

353
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,420
wants to convey to everyone.

354
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,000
The inspiration for Secret Series came from dandelions.

355
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,790
The meaning of dandelions

356
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,130
is... waiting for a reunion.

357
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,530
This is also the biggest secret of the Secret Series.

358
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,830
Don't leave!

359
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,060
- Don't leave!
- That's right.

360
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,160
- Don't leave!
- Don't leave!

361
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,190
When are we going to announce ours?

362
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,290
In your dreams.

363
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,490
This is also the biggest secret of the Secret Series.

364
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,960
Chairman Li!

365
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,360
Did Manni tell you a long time ago?

366
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,330
Tell me what?

367
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,060
What Su Yi thought is what I thought too.

368
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,530
She wants to remove her makeup during the launch conference.

369
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,060
She will do this to see if anyone recognizes Mu Xiao, right?

370
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Are you a worm in her stomach?

371
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,190
She told me not to tell you just in case you would get worried.

372
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,590
Then let's do what she wants.

373
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,960
Sanbao,

374
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,340
arrange for some people during the launch conference

375
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,560
to see if there're any movements in Lee Group.

376
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,960
Protect Su Yi secretly when they see her,

377
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,430
but don't attract their attention.

378
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,870
Li Jiashang doesn't know we're here, right?

379
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,860
Do this later.

380
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,280
Still pretending?

381
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,890
This is called a heart-to-heart connection.

382
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,560
You just have to know

383
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,100
that, no matter what you do, I'll be on your side.

384
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,790
Do you want to think about coming to Lee Group to work?

385
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,860
Why are you laughing?

386
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,300
Hurry. Let's go to the hospital.

387
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,000
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

388
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,140
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

389
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,530
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

390
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:50,860
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

391
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,540
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

392
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:05,360
♫ Coincidentally, all insincere ♫

393
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,930
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

394
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:17,470
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

395
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,600
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

396
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,700
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

397
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,900
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

398
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:46,070
If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

399
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:52,960
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

400
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,410
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

401
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,670
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

402
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,890
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

403
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,970
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

404
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,530
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

405
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:20,330
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

406
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:26,360
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

407
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,200
♫ On the traveling train ♫

408
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,300
♫ You first get off ♫

409
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,830
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me ♫
