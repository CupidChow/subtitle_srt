15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,720
Xiangtai!

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,250
I am covered in oil! I am dirty!

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,560
You don't know.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,420
Your sister missed you so much during the time you were away!

19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,340
- Me too!
- You cooked!

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,710
So fatuous!

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,820
You don't return home often.

22
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,490
I made all your favorite dishes.

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,590
In the end, my brother knows me the best! By the way, how is the internship going?

24
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,220
I was just about to tell you about it.

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,130
I am working as Wu Linjiang's trainee.

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,050
I gathered some information. Uncle Mu and Chairman Li did have a conflict in the past.

27
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,760
The reason was that Uncle Mu was against giving Lee Group the first-generation patent.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,050
The first-generation patent?

29
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,490
Yes. Apparently, they had a huge argument back then.

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,750
It even caused serious disagreements regarding their profits.

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,410
Uncle Mu was prepared to bring the whole team with him

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,860
and leave Li Mu Research Institute.

33
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,700
I have been thinking about why these tragedies occurred with my father

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,820
and the reasons why those people wanted to hurt him.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,350
Sis, the weirdest thing is

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,830
Lee Group Research Institute has displays of past patents all over their walls.

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,320
Only the first-generation patent was missing.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,730
They said that the first generation is a confidential file,

39
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,430
so it is stored with the formulas.

40
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,590
Do you think I can use learning new formulas as an excuse

41
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,200
to investigate if my father's death

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,610
had to do with this secret first-generation patent?

43
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,760
This...

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,300
I don't know if Director Su has any other marketing requirements.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,930
The new product's results received very positive reviews.

46
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,520
People want to know what is the secret in the formula.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,940
If Director Su wants to learn about the specific formula,

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,730
you have to get the approval of our vice president or someone higher up.

49
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,000
Is that so? I thought it was in a storage box in the bank,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,890
and three people must open the lock at the same time.

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,660
Director Su, are you free tonight?

52
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,360
If you have other questions we can discuss them while dining.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,320
She's not free.

54
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,210
I am actually not free. I have to meet someone.

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,180
Really? I also have to meet someone.

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,080
Such a coincidence.

57
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,020
Talk.

58
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,650
This Zheng Yi

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,380
was involved in a huge lawsuit when he was a forensic examiner.

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,900
The plaintiff was also his own employer.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,910
But this Zheng Yi only ended up quitting and changing his job,

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,390
and did not even receive any punishment.

63
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,700
What lawsuit was it?

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,260
He was suspected of reselling donated bodies at a higher cost.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,790
So Li Mu could've got their bodies from Zheng Yi.

66
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,660
But Li Mu's research doesn't require the use of a body,

67
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,880
so what were they experimenting in secret?

68
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,490
You two talk, just ignore me.

But I didn't get the short end of the stick.

Did he think I would leave like a silly, innocent girl?

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,630
He must have something to cover up, or else he wouldn't want to make me leave so quickly.

Then do you want to ask Li Jiashang?

But if they use a paper box, the flavor will be affected by other foods.

145
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,170
If they use a wooden box, the dessert will maintain its original flavor.

The exchange for it is the formula for Lee Group's new item?

285
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,240
Interesting. If they had a machine that can figure out the components,

286
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,950
they can still figure out most of the formula.

287
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,440
But Lee Group's strong suit is not in the formula.

288
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,400
It's in putting out the product first and the brand effect.

289
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,120
Even if Lin Zi got the formula,

290
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,520
they cannot produce it as large-scale as the Lee Group. Therefore, they can't decrease the cost of production.

291

There's no point.

292

I am curious as to why he is doing this.

If you don't mind leaking the formula,

No.

296
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,630
What I mean is that we can't just give it to him.

297
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,030
Lee Group and the research institute both have his spies.

298
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,230

It's not that you can't. At Lee Group, if you want a higher position,

302
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,990

why was the first-generation patent prohibited for use?

Actually, that was Uncle Mu's decision.

317
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,760
It's because the first-generation products were flawed.

318
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,170
But my grandpa disagreed. He was scared that he would miss out on being the first to put it out into the market.

319
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,120
At the time, they argued a lot in the company because of this.

320
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,220
But Grandpa agreed at the end.

321
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,520
Uncle Mu and Lee Group worked on the fourth-generation product together.

322
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,210
So Grandpa couldn't fire Uncle Mu because of that.

323
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,160
So that's what happened.

324
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,520
That's good.

325
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,840
My little Xiangtai.

326
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,180
- Let's go stargazing together.
- Okay.

327
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,960
Bye-bye.

328
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,720
This drink is for you, Mrs. Zheng.

329
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
Hello Mr. Zheng.

330
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,800
In the future, you have to remember to be a good husband.

331
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Yangyang, where should we go for our honeymoon?

332
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,100
I was just going to tell you. I got a year-long break,

333
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,710
we can tour Europe on a cruise.

334
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,130
Maybe another one. I get seasick.

335
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,870
Also, it's too far.

336
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,630
And you know, if I leave for too long,

337
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,280
Lee Group can't survive without me.

338
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,710
Then we can go to Semporna

339
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,740
to scuba dive. Let me tell you,

340
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,570
- the fish tornado there is magnificent.
- No, no, no, no, no.

341
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,820
I have a phobia of the deep sea.

342
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,580
Then we can go to Nepal.

343
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,560
It's close, and we can paraglide.

344
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,010
I'm afraid of heights. My heart will leave my body.

345
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,470
Then you can stay home and do nothing.

346
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,610
Why are you so impatient?

347
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,630
You say no to everything. How are we supposed to have fun?

348
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,480
We can stay home. Also, I didn't say no to everything.

349
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,450
- Whatever. I didn't get married just to have someone to argue with.
- Who said that?

350
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,640
How did you develop this outlook on marriage?

351
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,600
- My dad said it.
- That's why his marriage failed. What couple doesn't argue?

352
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,810
Marriage is just choosing someone to argue with.

353
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,660
You did not say this when you were proposing.

354
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,400
Well, how else would I get you to say yes?

355
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,160
Just nine words.

356
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,570
You won't get the short end of the stick.

357
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,910
What's wrong?

358
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,220
Look at others.

359
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,870
Didn't you tell me to look at the stars?

360
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,900
I'm saying look at how quickly the others are advancing.

361
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,280
But I'm still young, right?

362
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,550
Are you young?

363
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,870
Maybe not that young?

364
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,320
I don't care. I don't like to do things way behind everyone else.

365
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,490
But you can't bite off more than you can chew.

366
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,210
Then I'll take just one bite

367
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,540
at a time.

368
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Then you can take one bite at a time.

369
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,180
You said to stargaze, but there are no stars today.

370
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,910
This is called a romantic vibe, okay?

371
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,760
What was said in the recording?

372
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,720
Too bad there's no helpful information.

373
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,030
Just things that we already know.

374
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,160
That's too bad. One more evidence that led to a dead end.

375
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,850
Oh right, how did you discover Gao Mu's spies?

376
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,690
Oh my.

377
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,180
I found that someone was secretly targeting Secretary Lin.

378
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,080
It's all thanks to me, who was investigating your father's financial records. You wouldn't know without investigating,

379
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
- but I found that–
- Hey, how much fake alcohol did you drink?

380
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,730
- Xiyang.
- Zheng He, go home.

381
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,840
- Oh, go home.
- Go, go.

382
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
- Then I'll go home.
- Go, go.

383
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,670
- Bye, Yiyi.
- Be careful, Yangyang.

384
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,040
Excuse him, he had too much to drink.

385
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,480
Sis, I have to discuss something with you.

386
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,020
If I go on vacation with someone else,

387
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,780
would you be sad?

388
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,870
You just finished your internship and you're leaving again?

389
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,310
- Who are you going with?
- With me, of course.

390
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Sis, this is still in the midst of discussion.

391
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,150
- it's not for sure yet.
- But...

392
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,920
you guys just started dating.

393
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,600
It's not even stable. If you just follow her there,

394
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,480
what if she dumps you during the trip?

395
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,480
You're going to have to come running back. How embarrassing is that, Su Xiangtai?

396
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,770
Sis, we are in a stable stage of our relationship.

397
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,260
I think that love

398
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,950
needs courage.

399
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,610
It needs the other person's company even more.

400
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,150
Su Xiangtai, come here.

401
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,460
You have never traveled alone with a girl. This time you're leaving so impulsively.

402
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,040
Would you really do this to your sister?

403
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,080
Sis, didn't you say that

404
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,380
people need to grow up on their own?

405
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,720
- You are quite impressive.
- Of course.

406
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,040
Xiangtai is still a kid, don't be too heavy-handed.

407
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,460
You need to be careful as well.

408
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,440
Also, I don't want to always lean on you.

409
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Okay, I guess when a guy gets older he'll always run away from home.

410
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,610
Go, go go. I'll take care of your sister.

411
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,630
I'll take care of your brother.

412
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,890
- Sis–
- Don't get physical.

413
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,620
Don't get physical.

414
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,300
Sis, I'll return quickly.

415
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,010
Stop talking, don't say anything else.

416
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,410
- Let me be sad and alone for a while.
- Look how mad you made your sister.

417
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,730
Su Xiangtai, you are so cruel.

418
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,790
Let's go, baby. I'll take you to pack.

419
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,660
- You mean, you want me to pretend to be mad and try to prevent him from leaving?
- Yes!

420
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,150
Xiangtai is actually a rebellious little boy deep down.

421
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,790
Some things, if you don't let him do it, he'll want to do it even more.

422
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,390
If he is unwilling to leave his house or leave you,

423
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,020
then when will I ever get my love?

424
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,600
Yiyi.

425
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,750
Yiyi.

426
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,560
Okay, okay, okay.

427
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,850
I'll promise you.

428
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,190
Xiangtai has also gone.

429
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,140
You should just move to my place.

430
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,420
I'm worried about you living alone.

431
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,830
That's decided then.

432
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,540
No, you are a germaphobe, and I can only sleep well in my own bed.

433
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,930
Also, living together will quickly deplete the mysterious and fresh feeling between two people.

434
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,890
And will make them immediately feel like an old couple.

435
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,440
But it also increases the sense of belonging, happiness, and closeness.

436
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,270
I said no, so it's a no.

437
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,150
You won't move there?

438
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,540
Okay, I'll move here.

439
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,470
From today on, try to get used to it.

440
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,580
Who would want to get used to you?

441
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,360
I think we should get used to each other.

442
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,640
♫ At the first meeting, stupid like a fool ♫

443
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,130
