All because of your 'good' idea.

The first class I took was negotiation.

to owe me forever.

153
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Tell me. This trick was supposed to irritate her,

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,900
but why does my heart feel stuffy?

155
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,000
- Have you ever learned physics?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
Don't be impatient. Hear me out.

157
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
This is called force. Does your face hurt right now?

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,300
- Of course.
- It should hurt. My hand also hurts.

159

They say "hurt a thousand of your enemy, you will lose eight hundred of your own."

If you had just said the last sentence,

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I would have understood your point as well.

162
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
- Hi, Director Su.
- Sister Su Yi.

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,100
Su Yi, this is the information on Mr. Murakami that you wanted me to look for.

164
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm still asking the legal department about his copyright issues.

165
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,300
No need to ask. Everyone come here.

166
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,900
- Did you take down Murakami Kei?
- So quickly? This is great!

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,300
I knew that Director Su would accomplish what she said she would.

168
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
Sorry to disappoint you all.

169
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
The co-branding with the artist didn't go well.

170
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,800
A female hero.

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Director Su completely destroys jerks.

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Do you feel satisfied?

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,700
Manager Luo, do you perhaps want to say that

174
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,900
this is your intention?

175
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,100
In Director Su's eyes,

176
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,400
do I appear this kind?

177
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Losing Murakami Kei is a serious loss to the planning of this new project.

178
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,300
This means that we can't promote and sell during the Golden Month.
(T/N : the best month for a company to sell and promote their products)

179
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,500
Can Ming Xiu handle a loss this severe?

180
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,600
I declare Min Xiu's collaboration and new project planning

181
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
terminated altogether.

182
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Manager Luo,

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
the fact that you're so hurriedly terminating the project

184
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,300
makes people think that this is exactly what you desired.

185
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Manager Luo must be a professional.

186
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
You also knew Murakami Kei's morale,

187
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
and were scared of it affecting the reputation of Lee Group,

188
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,000
that's why you terminated the collaboration with him.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,400
I firmly believe that

190
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,300
you wouldn't carelessly end

191
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,600
a long-term beneficial collaboration.

192
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,060
So I beg you to give Ming Xiu two weeks.

193
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,480
I will find an appropriate endorser.

194
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,230
- One week.
- Farewell, Manager Luo.

195
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,390
So I need everyone to take your time to look for people in every profession.

196
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,500
Focus on their most beautiful moments. Not the beauty that seems flawless,

197
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,400
but the kind that manifests confident energy.

198
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Our slogan for promoting the new item

199
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,700
is every single one of you.

200
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Everyone, good luck.

201
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
For next week's proposal report

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,600
we must be able to produce a flawless answer.

203
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,400
When the proposal passes, I promise everyone

204
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
to double your bonuses.

205
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
How's the situation with finding a new endorser going?

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
Meet with me tomorrow to tell me.

207
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,360
[One Secret]

208
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Why are you using my phone?

209
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,600
Why are you nervous? It can't recognize my face, I can't transfer your money.

210
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
I'm sending a text to Su Yi.

211
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Why are you sending a message to her?

212
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Why do you think?

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm helping you pursue your wife.

214
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Let me tell you.

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
No matter what,

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
she will not open up to me first.

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,600
If she doesn't confess, you won't either?

218
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
You two competing to see who can stay silent for longer?

219
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,800
What do you get from winning this competition? The chance to become a king? Inherit a kingdom?

220
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,700
Do you think I'm in the mood to joke around with you?

221
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,400
Do you think I can control my natural humor?

222
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm helping you and you don't even talk nicely to me.

223
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Last time you also said you're helping me.

224
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,200
If it works, it's because you've got a good fate.

225
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
If it fails, it's because I came up with a bad idea.

226
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay. Just act like I'm compensating for my wrongs.

227
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,000
Because you're trying to do something that you are so underqualified for.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,100
Here,

229
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm telling you. Tomorrow when you see–

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
- Hey.
- What?

231
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Look at my phone.

232
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Look at how long it's been since you sent her the message.

233
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
The phone doesn't even light up.

234
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
She hasn't replied in so long.

235
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,800
Do you think she's in danger?

236
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,100
I should give her a call.

237
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,800
I think you have developed an irrational fear of Su Yi getting hurt.

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Don't overdo it, find the perfect balance. Do you understand?

239
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,800
You wanted to leave her alone first. There is no point in sending her so many messages.

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,790
Do you get it?

241
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Don't send any more, okay?

242
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,580
[How about replacing the spokesperson? Meet tomorrow to report?]

243
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,730
[I get off work soon. Do you want to eat garlic or spicy shrimp?]

244
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,390
[Your goddess wants to eat shrimp for dinner tonight.]

245
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,220
[You better serve me well.]

246
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,790
Su Yi is not returning my messages.

247
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,020
She must be secretly dating.

248
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,200
I will spam her with calls

249
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,070
Xiyang.

250
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,330
Dad?

251
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,880
Long time no see. Today you have the night shift, right?

252
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,240
I already got off work.

253
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,490
This is...?

254
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,210
My wife. Quickly. Sit down, sit down.

255
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,610
Careful.

256
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,490
About to give birth. She wasn't feeling well today so I brought her to the hospital for a check-up.

257
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,990
She is your daughter?

258
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,390
Why haven't you mentioned that she works at the hospital before?

259
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,100
Xiyang, have you been doing well?

260
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,200
You're about to get married, right?

261
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,580
My boyfriend and I broke up last year.

262
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,790
As you should, as you should. That guy always looked so grim.

263
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,510
What your dad means is that you're not young anymore.

264
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,750
Quickly find one or else no one will want you.

265
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,730
Auntie.

266
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,100
Look at what you're saying.

267
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,550
Our Yangyang's admirers line up from the Eiffel Tower to the Great Rift Valley.

268
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,360
That's truly numerous, too many to choose from.

269
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
What do you mean "no one will want you"?

270
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
- You are...
- He is my boyfriend.

271
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,050
The hospital director's son.

272
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,670
That's good.

273
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,360
Don't be like her mom, who is always busy with her career and feels more robotic than human.

274
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,780
Auntie, I'm unhappy with the way you talk about my future mother-in-law.

275
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,750
What's wrong with women focusing on their careers? At least they can raise their own kids.

276
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,860
They are surely better than the ones who steal others' husbands

277
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,830
and try to make them stay by having a kid, right?

278
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,830
No, you–

279
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,930
Then Xiyang, if there's nothing wrong, we'll get going first.

280
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,020
Go, go, go.

281
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,040
Take care.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,570
That mister... is my father-in-law?

283
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,510
Can you stop being so perverted and following me around every day?

284
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,620
When did I follow you around?

285
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,990
I'm here to pick you up from work and to treat you to a midnight snack.

286
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,650
This Su Yi. She even dares to betray me.

287
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,800
I am your boyfriend.

288
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,120
We naturally have telepathy.

289
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,190
Hold on. What I said earlier was just to save face.

290
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,930
Don't take it seriously.

291
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,490
Then let's go home and eat these shrimp.

292
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,420
Zheng He, Zheng He.

293
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,170
I'm unlike you, living so carefree every day.

294
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,270
Aside from getting girls, you don't have any worries.

295
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,370
I used to think that you just didn't like me.

296
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,820
And that you think I'm not good enough for you, who are so brilliant.

297
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,990
Now I understand. It's because you feel bad about yourself.

298
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,260
What do you mean?

299
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,230
I'm suddenly extremely disappointed in you.

300
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,160
You should be disappointed.

301
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,660
That's because you're not the one who grew up with divorced parents.

302
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,560
You're not the one who has nobody behind your back to support you.

303
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,060
- You're not the one who has been through all the highs and lows.
- Enough!

304
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,490
Don't use your family as an excuse to avoid all your problems.

305
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,520
Who doesn't have childhood trauma?

306
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,660
You're grown, yet you still act so vulnerably. Are you unable to heal from how your parents have hurt you?

307
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,140
Don't you have friends? Don't you have me?

308
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,300
I'm just saying it casually.

309
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,020
Actually–

310
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,630
What Xiao Zheng said actually does make sense.

311
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,060
I really couldn't tell.

312
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,060
Then Miss Xia Xiyang, you gave into him just like that?

313
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,020
Of course not. Look at what kind of person I am.

314
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,370
- I slapped him so hard he–
- Tell me the truth.

315
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,480
I gave him three months to test out being my boyfriend.

316
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,660
Yangyang, I saw this coming. You have a passive personality.

317
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,390
But does this mean I purposely

318
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,530
helped Zheng He and Xia Xiyang get together?

319
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,010
I told you "test out". "Test out".

320
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,130
I don't see when we would become a real couple. If I'm unsatisfied, I can call it quits whenever.

321
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,390
Someone's getting impatient. She's impatient, impatient, impatient.

322
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,960
No.

323
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,510
[Ding Hang]

324
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,320
Hello?

325
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay.

326
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,190
Yaoyao, Ding Hang found it.

327
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,930
He found the name and picture of the medical examiner who conducted my dad's autopsy.

328
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,960
Later I'll go look for him.

329
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,990
Only a picture and name?

330
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,000
Ocean City is so large, iI thought it would be like finding a needle in a haystack.

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,090
I still have to find him. There are issues with Chu Mo again.

332
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,830
Okay, then I'll ask my colleagues. Maybe someone knows some medical examiners.

333
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,720
Let me see.

334
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,430
This person I recognize.

335
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,000
You recognize?

336
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,090
Zheng Yi. He's the department head of our hospital and also...

337
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,490
Zheng He's father.

338
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,980
I'm familiar with this place. My dad is the director, let me take you on a tour.

339
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,640
Li Jiashang and Zheng He are always hanging out together.

340
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,390
I will help him drink it.

341
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,960
They're closer than biological brothers.

342
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:15,450
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

343
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:22,400
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

344
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,930
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

345
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:36,350
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

346
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,920
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

347
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:50,790
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

348
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:56,320
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

349
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,970
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

350
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,930
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

351
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:18,140
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

352
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,230
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

353
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:31,500
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

354
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,360
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

355
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,860
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

356
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,130
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

357
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,340
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

358
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,410
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

359
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,870
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

360
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:05,750
Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

361
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,750
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

362
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,560
♫ On the travelling train ♫

363
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,730
♫ You first get off ♫

364
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:25,560
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
