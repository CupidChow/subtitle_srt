How do you still look so beautiful, even though you didn't wash your face?

17

Stop licking. The more you do, the thirstier you will be.

What should we do without any drinks?

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,930
We can't drink ocean water, nor rainwater, and we can't open the coconuts.

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,700
Haven't you hear about a saying?

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,080
It says "the fish disgorged moisture for each other when stranded".
(T/N: implies very good relationship between a couple or friends)

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,890
Did you hear of this saying too? "Enough is enough".

What should we do if no one really comes to save us?

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,200
I just got my hands on some shares of the retail investors,

164
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,400
and am now the new director of Lee Group.

165
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,800
These three securities companies

166
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
are companies that the Lee Group looked down on.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
However, they are just like me. No pain, no gain.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,200
Currently, President Gao, Gao Mu holds more than 1/3rd

169
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
shares or entrusted shares of Lee Group, and this legally entitles him to be on the management board.

170
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,100
Moreover, this acquisition also increases the stock price of Lee Group.

171
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,900
Of course. It can be viewed as

172
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,800
Lee Group's fairness to the market.

173
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,500
Chairman Gao, make yourself at home. Let's continue.

174
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,100
I hope everyone can continue working hard.

175
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,900
I hope that everyone will be at the team building.

176
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Chairman Gao, with the acquisition of Lee Group's shares,

177
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,800
Lin Zi has become the biggest shareholder. What do you think about it?

178
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I think that Lee Group

179
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
is a company with unlimited potential.

180
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
It's my honor—

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,400
Gao Mu has impacted us badly.

182
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Grandpa, our shares, and also the shares from some of our uncles,

183
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
although surpass 50 percent,

184
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,100
Gao Mu's shares have already surpassed mine.

185
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,600
If you hand over your voting rights to me,

186
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,400
I have the ability to solve this matter.

187
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,700
Don't count on me. I won't get involved.

188
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,430
I still have things to do, I'm leaving.

189
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Chairman Li, are you really not going to get involved?

190
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,200
If he can't defend Lee Group in this situation,

191
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Lee Group will fail under his hands too in the future.

192
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Give him a call.

193
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
You saw the news, right?

194
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
How could I not know?

195
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
It's such a big action. Don't forget my warning.

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Don't touch things that you shouldn't.

197
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
It has been tough for you lately.

198
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
The food on the flight must be bad. I will take you to have seafood later.

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,200
I can't, I'm allergic.

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Okay, if you're allergic don't eat it.

201
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
- Let's have hotpot.
- It's too heaty.

202
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes, that's right. What about steak?

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm a vegetarian these days.

204
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,800
- You don't want to eat this and that—
- Can you focus on your driving?

205
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Don't talk.

206
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,600
Let's go to Jinchi Hotel.

207
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,300
Let's go.

208
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
What's wrong?

209
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,170
Manni just texted me. She said that she saw Xia Xiyang

210
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,200
and a strange man checking into the room.

211
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,100
Really?

212
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,000
Darling!

213
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,800
This won't do. It's not sexy enough.

214
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,100
Darling.

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,900
Darling!

216
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Darling?

217
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't look, leave.

218
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,400
What are you doing?

219
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,500
I wanted to surprise you.

220
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,800
Do you know I have been frustrated lately?

221
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,630
Can you stop giving me trouble?

222
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,200
I...

223
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,800
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
I just wanted to make you happy.

225
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,210
You don't need to do this for me.

226
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,400
But, you look very pretty.

227
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,500
I overlooked this and forgot to collude with you.

228
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,700
Yiyi, when will I get that kind of surprise?

229
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,730
Jiashang, there's something I haven't been telling you.

230
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Then tell me, why are you so serious?

231
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,200
Brother Mu, you have to hurry up and leave this place. There's someone after me.

232
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,800
If something happens to me, it must be Li—

233
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,500
Gao Mu gave this recording to me.

234
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,100
The recording is real.

235
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,400
That means, someone took my dad's phone from the scene of the accident.

236
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,600
I did not continue investigating because there was debris from another car at the scene.

237
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
And it turned out that the owner of the car was Chairman Li.

238
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,800
I think I can tell you now.

239
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Truthfully, I've always suspected

240
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,600
that the Li person in the recording,

241
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,220
is your grandfather, Li Yaohui.

242
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Yiyi, do you know that

243
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
when your father passed away, Li Mu Research Institute was shut down?

244
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Gao Mu was also kicked out from the Li family by my grandpa.

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Before that, Gao Mu's family name was Li.

246
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,400
But "Brother Mu" in my father's recording,

247
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,500
is that Gao Mu's name?

248
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,200
I can't figure this out too. When your father was in the car accident,

249
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,800
I didn't pick up your call because I was with Grandpa.

250
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
He wanted me to intern at Lee Group.

251
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,700
He couldn't have arranged for someone to retrieve your father's cellphone from the scene of the accident.

252
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,000
Based on what you said, Gao Mu is hiding a lot of things.

253
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,400
Yiyi, don't worry.

254
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,100
Regardless of the final truth,

255
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,900
I will give you and your father a fair explanation.

256
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,600
Why did you drink so much?

257
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,500
Three bottles of white wine, done.

258
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,520
What are you doing?

259
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,030
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

260
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,590
No. Come back with me.

261
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,100
Don't bother me!

262
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,020
Today I'll sleep here.

263
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,130
Xiangtai,

264
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,220
do you know why I like to sleep in hotels?

265
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,690
Because you are afraid that once I know where you live,

266
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,190
I will cling to you even after we break up.

267
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,180
You're really cute.

268
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,420
It's because I can change hotels anytime.

269
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,480
I don't want to rely on any one person or place.

270
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,220
Why?

271
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,920
Because once you get close to someone,

272
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,950
you'll become each other's maze.

273
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,300
Hence, you like superficial relationships,

274
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,260
like to avoid deep topics,

275
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,850
and like to use jokes to brush me off.

276
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,500
What a big grievance.

277
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,750
You are doing this again.

278
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,190
But I really want to walk into your maze and truly understand you.

279
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,560
My love for you is not lesser than yours.

280
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,000
Who said boys with big chests are brainless?

281
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,030
You.

282
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm such a badass.

283
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,270
Who says you aren't?

284
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,520
Tell me. Why do I like you so much?

285
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Why do I fall for your tricks?

286
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,340
Yiyi,

287
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,540
do you know why I fear fire?

288
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,130
I remember taking an afternoon nap when I was five years old.

289
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,630
I was suddenly awakened by thick smoke. When I opened the door,

290
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,070
there was fire everywhere.

291
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,290
I desperately yelled for my mom and dad but there was no response at all.

292
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,330
I wanted to open the door to escape,

293
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,000
but I realized I couldn't do it.

294
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,790
When I woke up,

295
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,900
I was lying on a hospital bed.

296
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,330
For people who have struggled in the dark, when they see the light,

297
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,780
they may not dare to move forward.

298
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,420
Jiashang, those hurts and fears,

299
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,090
are not our mistakes.

300
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,130
We deserve to be better.

301
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,870
Three bottles of white wine.

302
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,780
Done.

303
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,500
You have never said such courteous words in your life.

304
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,390
It has been tough for you.

305
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,150
How are you?

306
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,650
Awesome.

307
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,040
Several directors agreed to transfer their shares to you.

308
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,450
Fearing that they will go back on their words, the deposits and agreements have been settled.

309
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,670
Then, Grandpa and I will each hold 30 percent of the shares.

310
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,010
We should celebrate now.

311
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,150
It's not the time yet.

312
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,350
Everyone here is my family and best friends.

313
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,380
I owe everyone an apology.

314
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,820
I have been hiding something.

315
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,090
Hence today, I hope to seek your understanding,

316
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,040
and help too.

317
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,400
August 2014.

318
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,360
Mu Feng, an employee of Li Mu Research Institute, got into a car accident.

319
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,020
His daughter, Mu Xiao, was also in the same car accident.

320
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,640
That was me.

321
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,220
I lost all my memories from before the car accident. I had completed my university degree in Japan,

322
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,120
when I received the September 2014 edition of Ming Xiu magazine.

323
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,910
So I returned to China to clarify this matter.

324
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,250
I found the clues till here, then I couldn't find anymore,

325
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,920
till a mishap occurred to Director Zheng.

326
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,940
The verdict of my father's death is finalized. You don't need to say this.

327
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,740
You don't need to be involved too.

328
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,350
Su Yi, you don't want to live a stable life. Don't take us along with you.

329
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,770
Even if there are other secrets, it's my personal matter.

330
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,760
Mind your own business.

331
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,980
Zheng He, everyone is upset about the death of Uncle Zheng,

332
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,370
but if you think this way, it's too much.

333
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,190
Jiashang.

334
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Zheng He.

335
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,760
Let's go.

336
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,310
Jiashang, what are you doing?

337
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,760
If you want to go back, I can drive you there.

338
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,740
Zheng He, we will worry if you keep being like this.

339
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,200
You all?

340
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,970
I can go back myself.

341
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,310
Hey!

342
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,070
This favor is rather dangerous.

343
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,560
I know. Hence, I won't force you.

344
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,910
Thank you in advance, everyone.

345
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,030
However, seeing that you are Xiangtai's older sister,

346
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,270
and also taking my ex-fiance into consideration, based on these two points,

347
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,100
I will join.

348
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,560
I have always regarded Su Yi as my own little sister. Besides, Gao Mu is a threat to Lee Group.

349
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,740
If you need my help at any time, just let me know.

350
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,450
I avoided this before,

351
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,200
but now I want to redeem everything.

352
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,970
Frankly, I have longed for this opportunity for a long time.

353
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,490
Since I have already wet my feet,

354
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,170
why not take a bath at the same time?

355
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
Thank you, everyone.

356
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,210
You ask me to sign the supplies budget for the last quarter?

357
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,460
Go ask Zheng He.

358
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,690
He's not here yet? Just wait then.

359
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,100
Public Relations Department just said that the client's budget hasn't been approved. Can you approve this for me?

360
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,300
It also got stuck with Zheng He?

361
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,250
Don't be angry. His mood has been bad lately.

362
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,730
Bad mood? Is bad mood an excuse?

363
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,380
You said I spoke too harshly to him yesterday. You wanted me to apologize and

364
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,160
give in to him too. Look at what he's doing now.

365
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,810
He's slacking off and playing hooky. Look at his attitude.

366
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,510
I really spoiled him too much in the past.

367
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,750
