00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,700
Isn't this boyfriend of yours a little useful?

164
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,760
I need my phone to post it in my work moments.

165
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Smile.

166
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,720
Why are you looking at me?

167
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,880
You're prettier than the artwork.

168
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,000
This art seems like it's been drawn by someone who has nightmares often.

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,420
It seems like my style.

170
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,640
This was painted by an Austrian painter after he got Alzheimer's disease.

171
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,850
He desperately wanted to keep his feelings and thoughts at that time.

172
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,080
He used this concrete method to express his memories and time.

173
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,370
This series of paintings took ten years.

174
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,590
Ten years?

175
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,030
It's longer than my memories.

176
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,360
People always love to compare women to flowers.

177
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Look at these.

178
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,100
Don't!

179
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,200
It doesn't matter whether they bloom or decay,

180
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,410
at least they have roots and have their origin.

181
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,880
But what about me?

182
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,790
Do you know what your behavior of ruining a flower is like?

183
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,000
It's the black lotus.
 (TN: The black lotus is a type of tool in games in China)

184
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,820
I didn't expect that CEO Li, who is so busy with work,

185
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,920
still had time to surf the net with 6G.

186
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,090
You even know these terms.

187
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,560
There used to be a glass tower near my house before.

188
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,130
It is said that I once went up, and I cried.

189
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,060
I cried for two hours and even threw up.

190
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,820
It's not funny.

191
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,350
I actually don't remember this. It was my grandfather who told me.

192
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,940
It's not important if you can't remember the past.

193
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,220
My memories are your memories.

194
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,880
The origin is here.

195
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,040
Then, may I ask, why did I like you back then?

196
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,030
Did anyone else like me? Did we fight a lot?

197
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,920
Did you do anything to me that you'll feel sorry for?

198
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,070
How does it feel to date your ex-girlfriend today?

199
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,160
You're not my ex-girlfriend. We never broke up.

200
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,660
Then why did you let me go back then?

201
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,510
Back then, I was with my grandpa.

202
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,900
So I didn't receive your phone call.

203
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,810
I always felt guilty.

204
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,250
Don't. Don't feel guilty.

205
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,570
Don't bring guilt for Mu Xiao to approach me.

206
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,410
Bring yourself and dignity.

207
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,120
That way, you'll have more charm.

208
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,130
Why did you push me away?

209
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,250
Thank you for helping to stop the water from splashing on me on time.

210
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,910
I'm asking why you pushed me away!

211
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,330
Weren't you planning to help me block it anyway?

212
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,690
- This is different.
- How is it different?

213
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,250
The result is the same. The process doesn't matter.

214
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,820
How can this be the same?

215
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,570
Let's take marriage as an example. Say I tie you up and force you to come with me to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get married.

216
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,330
How can it be the same as me proposing to you and then the both of us willingly going to the Civil Affairs Bureau?

217
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,810
CEO Li,

218
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,310
if you place this sensitive thinking in your business opportunities,

219
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,120
I guarantee that Lee Group's market value will double.

[VERSINO]

221

I'm mad. Can't I eat ice cream?

222
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,370
Sorry, the ice cream machine has a problem.

223
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,790
We might have to wait a little longer, sorry.

224
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,990
Let me pick up this call.

225

Hello, Yangyang.

226
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,810
Good news. Director Zheng just agreed to the interview at seven o'clock tonight.

227
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,460
Seven o'clock?

228
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,240
Can we change the time? I have something to do over here. It takes half an hour to go over there.

229
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,160
Okay. Director Zheng only has time today.

230
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,750
I can only stall for a bit. Hurry and come over.

231
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,110
I'll try to hurry up.

232
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,190
Hello.

233
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,880
What's wrong?

234
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,230
Do you mind waiting in line again?

235
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,650
I don't mind.

236
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,370
Thank you.

237
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,970
I mind!

238
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,400
It's tiring for me to earn money.

239
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,900
Jiashang, I have some urgent work so I'll be leaving now.

240
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll send you.

241
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,500
No need.

242
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,200
There's an interview over at Ming Xiu. It's not in the same direction where you're going.

243
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Don't tire yourself out.

244
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,000
Thank you Director Zheng for accepting our interview.

245
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,900
If you're interested in the topic of my next dissertation,

246
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,000
I can show you guys something.

247
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Thank you, Director Zheng.

248
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Okay.

249
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,700
Here. Have a look.

250
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Thank you.

251
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Actually, I've always been interested in Director Zheng's background and experiences.

252
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,300
Why did you decide to move from forensic science to clinical medicine?

253
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,800
When I was working in forensic science,

254
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,200
while doing an autopsy

255
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
I accidentally cut my hand.

256
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,200
When I was cleaning it, I thought

257
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,400
if I was infected,

258
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
then what would happen to Zheng He?

259
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Later on, I left my job in the forensic science field.

260
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,100
I arrived at the hospital and finally got a righteous job.

261
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Director Zheng,

262
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,900
can I see Zheng He's baby photos?

263
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
I didn't expect Director Zheng to be upright,

264
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,900
but you didn't inherit anything.

265
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,900
I, a young master, am genetically superior from the outset.

266
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Look.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
This was taken on my mom's 25th birthday.

268

When I went to find Director Zheng today, the safe didn't seem to be closed properly.

Zheng He, your hospital is so big.

I can even get lost just by going to the bathroom.

Uncle Zheng, how come you have time today to greet guests?

283
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,800
It's because of your Lee Group's new product, that's why we especially had this interview.

I would've driven you here.

291

Are you mad?

What can I do in order for you to reduce your anger?

When the time is suitable, I'll definitely tell you.

Hello.

310
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,200
I didn't expect Director Su to get such a famous broadcaster over.

311
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
Hello, Director Su.

312
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
I've felt your sincerity in inviting me over, Director Su.

313
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
This is Lee Group's first live broadcast. There are some opinions,

314
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
so I'll just be frank.

315
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,000
First, our broadcast schedule

316
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
is too long.

317
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
The audience might not have the patience.

These suggestions are really good.

319
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
We decided to collaborate with you among all the broadcasters because we saw your professionalism.

320
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,800
But, Lee Group's live broadcast this time isn't focused on commerce.

321
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,300
Product teasers need to possess a feeling of mystery.

322
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,400
And this is where we will definitely need Broadcaster Jin's charm.

323
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
Director Su, you really know how to flatter someone.

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
I want to get you on our team,

325
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
and be my partner.

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
Do the broadcast well and don't mess around.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm asking you one last time. Are you releasing the notice or not?

328
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,500
Okay, if you're not going to release it, then I'll look for someone else.

329
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
If you're ready, then we can start.

330
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm ready.

331
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
[Ding Hang]

332
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Sorry.

333
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,700
No problem. Let's start.

334
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
Okay.

335
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,400
Hello everyone.

336
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,000
Today, we have Teacher Jin, who has ten million followers, here with us at the live streaming at Ming Xiu.

337
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Together, we'll be providing a teaser of the upcoming Lee Group products to be released.

338
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Now, let's have Teacher Jin take over.

339
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Hello, everyone. Good afternoon.

340
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,200
I'm at Lee Group's office now.

341
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I have a surprise that I would like to share with everyone today.

342
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Do you see this golden cap?

343
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,200
First off, this product has brightening and protective properties.

344
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Then its...

345
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
I do have to admit that Teacher Jin is really a professional.

346
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,100
Director Su is so interesting.

347
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,000
Next, we'd like to show everyone one of our new product lines.

348
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Let's trouble Broadcaster Jin to bring over our new products

349
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
for everyone to see.

350
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,400
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

351
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:04,500
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

352
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,000
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

353
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,200
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

354
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,000
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

355
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

356
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,400
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

357
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,000
♫The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

358
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:53,000
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

359
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,200
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

360
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,300
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

361
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:13,600
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

362
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

363
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,000
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

364
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,200
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

365
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,400
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

366
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

367
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,000
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

368
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,800
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

369
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,800
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

370
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,600
♫ On the travelling train ♫

371
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,800
♫ You first get off ♫

372
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,300
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
