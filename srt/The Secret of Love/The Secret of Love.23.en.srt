00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,740
[Episode 23]

14
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,680
Your mom has written a book too, right?

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,020
- Didn't she leave you a souvenir?
- How did you know about it?

16
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,610
Zheng He, don't be like this.

17
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,920
Tell me the truth.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,040
What should I do? Zheng He already knows

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,730
that Su Yi suspected Zheng Yi.
[Let's meet again, tomorrow 3pm]

20
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,750
Su Yi.

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,610
I can't reach Su Yi right now.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,330
Yumei, do you have to be this cruel?

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,900
Cut. Pause.

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,610
Miss Xiatian, very good.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,830
Make sure your gazes are more direct.

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,650
I never thought he would be this good at acting.

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,460
Pretty handsome.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,930
All set, Director.

29
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,530
Okay.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,810
Hello? Zheng He, listen to me.

31
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,480
I will be there soon, wait for me.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,810
Zheng He? Why are you here?

33
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,500
Follow me.

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,010
Zheng He?

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,450
Zheng He!

36
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,450
- Can't you speak properly?
- Come back with me.

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,550
Start over and be a new person.

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,310
You meeting with my father,

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,480
why did you not tell me?

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,960
Zheng He, I didn't hide that from you on purpose.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,360
I just wasn't sure about what happened.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,440
You know what I cannot accept?

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,930
You told me family is everything. You told me this!

44
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,870
I looked to you as family.

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,350
You all lied to me.

46
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,390
Should I believe everything you say is true? Do you think I am stupid?

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,460
- Calm down.
- If you really wanted to know more about my father,

48
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,760
why didn't you ask me? You could have simply asked me.

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,250
Or is it that you never trusted me?

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,180
I just did not know how to tell you.

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,840
Towards Uncle Zheng, I also feel very regretful.

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,300
Su Yi!

53
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,170
You have to pay, you know?

54
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,230
This is a debt someone paid for you.

55
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,770
But I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

56
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,210
Okay. Okay.

57
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,910
Then go back with me. Start over and do something else.

58
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,310
Tell the police everything you know.

59
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,130
- Zheng He. Zheng He, listen to me.
- Zheng He.

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,470
Let us talk alone.

61
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,780
Zheng He, calm down.

62
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,680
Let's talk.

63
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,140
You already hit me, now can we talk?

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
Hiding it from you, was my idea.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,600
I feared that after you found out that Uncle Zheng had something to do with the car accident,

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,610
you would get hurt.

67
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,570
So like this, I won't get hurt?

68
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,230
This is our mistake, but I can promise you

69
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,110
that Su Yi didn't do anything to harm Uncle Zheng.

70
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,780
She wanted to tell you.

71
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,390
Then Uncle Zheng had the incident, it was then even harder to tell you.

72
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,650
These are not reasons you should hide from me.

73
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,310
You can go.

74
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,470
- I want to be alone.
- Zheng He?

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,110
No matter how others view me,

76
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,200
I think of myself as a guilty person.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,640
The mistakes I made, under my self evaluation

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,030
I can never clear them.

79
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,150
Yumei, let's never separate.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,910
Cut. Very good.

81
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,200
That's a wrap, thank you everyone.

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,300
Everyone, return to the hotel and pack up.

83
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,870
Then, let's all meet near the shore.

84
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,270
Good work, Sister Xiatian. Good work.

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,390
Take Sister Xiatian back to the hotel.

86
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,480
Good work. Good work.

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,270
Good work.

88
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,190
Sis, what did Zheng He need?

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,840
No worries, go back and pack your luggage.

90
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,510
Oh right! I heard the Director praised you.

91
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,620
Not bad, your acting was good.

92
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,950
Yeah, you acted so well.

93
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,410
Even I feel a little jealous.

94
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,770
Wasn't the script written by a certain someone?

95
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,210
I'm still jealous.

96
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,310
Hello? Sir, where are you now?

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,870
Yes, we will wait for you here.

98
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,250
Okay.

99
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,490
The driver will be here soon. Let's wait a bit.

100
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,230
What's wrong?

101
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,510
- Did you twist your ankle?
- Does it hurt?

102
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,060
It's okay, I just need to sit down.

103
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,000
Su Yi. I forgot to pay the bill for the bar.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,870
- Can you go pay for me?
- Okay.

105
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,900
Remember to bring me the receipt.

106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,010
Take care of Manni.

107
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,290
- I can go get you some ice.
- No, it's fine.

108
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,560
You can just stay with me.

109
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,420
Where did they go?

110
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,290
There was no more room in the car.

111
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,680
I called the car. The seating should have been enough.

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,220
The hotel check in is at 7 or they will cancel, they couldn't wait any longer.

113
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,310
Then why are you here?

114
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,720
Manni said there is a location for filming that they need to check beforehand.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,510
I just so happen to have Zheng He's car.

116
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,690
- Why don't you come with me?
- Is Zheng He all right?

117
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,690
Did you both resolve the issue?

118
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,830
Uncle Zheng's situation has been settled.

119
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,890
Leave Zheng He to me.

120
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,950
I will help him walk out of it.

121
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,810
You should change your shoes first, they are all wet.

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,650
No, it's not wet. I don't need to change.

123
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,670
The check-in has a long line,

124
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,550
let's first fill our stomachs.

125
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,150
I'm not hungry.

126
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,070
Why don't I stand in line for us?

127
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,280
No need, I am this hotel's VVVIP.

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,850
Waiter, bring the menu.

129
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,950
Yangyang, don't blame yourself.

130
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,310
We have to tell him, eventually.

131
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,660
Hello? Hello?

132
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,430
There's no signal on this island. After entering the mountain roads, it will be even more unlikely.

133
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,510
What? Spending time with me alone is that difficult?

134
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,430
A lot of people that break up are still friends.

135
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,840
Not that, I...

136
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,560
Your stomach hurts again? Did you bring medicine?

137
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
In the suitcase.

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,900
- Then let's go back.
- No need.

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm really okay. I'll feel better after I starve it out.

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,240
Work is more important.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,320
Why don't you register our check-in. Bring the hotel key to me later, thank you.

142
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,300
Okay, can you give me everyone's ID?

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,540
I already booked online.

144
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,560
You can just bring me the hotel key.

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,090
I'm sorry,

146
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,350
we need an official ID here. Any type of ID is all right.

147
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,970
No, what I mean is you can go register our check-in first and then check identification.

148
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,410
When all our members are here, it can be confirmed.

149
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,430
What's the issue? I already said,

150
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,970
we can just check-in first.

151
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,250
Excuse us.

152
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,040
She's doesn't feel well today.

153
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,570
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

154
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,570
Who has all our IDs?

155
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,360
Stop the car.

156
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,190
What's wrong?

157
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,000
They hurried there but can't go in. I have all their IDs.

158
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,230
Then I can take you back.

159
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,000
No need. I can take a taxi.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,080
You go check out the location first, don't want to have any more delay.

161
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,010
Eat something.

162
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,640
You can't punish yourself because you're angry.

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,160
What time is it? They should be back by now.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,590
Nothing happened to them, right?

165
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,290
Curses.

166
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,040
Just now, on Kumquat Island mountain roads,

167
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,190
a car fell from the cliff. Victims are one male and one female.

168
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,600
Police and ambulances have arrived on the scene.

169
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,280
They have not confirmed identity,

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,410
and appearance to the public.

171
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,480
Age is around 40 years and above.

172
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,120
That scared me so badly.

173
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,090
This late, why are they not back yet?

174
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,920
This late at night, they won't be in any danger, right?

175
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,990
They will be fine.

176
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,590
Why don't we wait for them inside?

177
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,120
I'll wait here for them.

178
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,520
What about you?

179
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,770
I'll keep him company.

180
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,280
Everyone, let's not worry too much, they will come back soon.

181
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,790
- Su Yi!
- Sis!

182
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,460
Manni, the ID's.

183
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,890
Why are you here alone? What about Li Jiashang?

184
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,730
Didn't you ask him to check out the location?

185
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,480
I didn't!

186
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,150
I did ask him to check out the location, he just told me he wanted to spend more time with you.

187
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,130
The mountain has no signal, the GPS won't work.

188
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,030
Don't all cars have a built-in GPS?

189
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,110
I rented the car, the GPS doesn't work.

190
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,560
What do we do?

191
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,660
Manni, let me take the car.

192
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,840
You guys check in first, I'll go find him.

193
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,380
I should remember the place where we separated.

194
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,460
Okay, I'm going.

195
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,680
Sis, I...

196
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,050
Stop third wheeling.

197
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,670
Wait here.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,830
The tire didn't pop either.

199
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,740
Why is the car not working?

200
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,530
Li Jiashang? Li Jiashang.

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,460
What is this?

202
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,260
There's no signal, no battery, car broke down.

203
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,150
Why am I so unlucky?

204
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,930
Li Jiashang?

205
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,120
Li Jiashang?

206
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,990
Li Jiashang?

207
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,250
Li Jiashang?

208
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,420
Li Jiashang?

209
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,630
Li Jiashang?

210
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,150
I'm telling you, knock it off.

211
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,380
If you don't stop, I will leave you.

212
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,560
Li Jiashang?

213
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,620
Actually, my sister feels really guilty.

214
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,270
Before, when she thought her father was actually corrupt, she almost gave up.

215
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,520
But I believe Uncle Zheng was not a bad person.

216
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,300
He was just holding onto a secret.

217
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,860
It's been an hour, and they are still not back yet.

218
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,230
- Did you call the police?
- They won't file missing person's reports

219
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,100
until it has been 24 hours.

220
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,570
I'll go take another look.

221
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,300
Jiashang?

222
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,220
Knock it off.

223
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,830
Jiashang...

224
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,900
Stop scaring me.

225
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,030
I don't want any more people around me to get hurt.

226
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,530
Breaking up with you, and saying those words, I am also in pain.

227
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,630
I just want you to safely return.

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,530
Jiashang...

229
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,470
Other than losing you,

230
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,220
nothing else is that important.

231
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,360
♫  My intuition  ♫

232
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,700
♫  Makes me born to be humble  ♫

233
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,160
♫  I'm not considered special  ♫

234
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,570
♫  Perhaps it is a kind of test  ♫

235
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,990
♫  Day and night,  ♫

236
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,990
♫  I try to make this world pure  ♫

237
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,130
♫  Can you be like this, don't disturb me today?  ♫

238
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,030
Why didn't you wait in the car? Where did you run off to?

239
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,270
Just now we were kissing. But now,

240
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,500
you flipped faster than the pages of a book.

241
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,130
You heard what I said earlier?

242
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,100
Your leg, how did you hurt yourself?

243
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,310
I just tried to climb a tree and pick a few berries to eat.

244
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,200
Try it.

245
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,700
So this is the berry.

246
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,200
I will never eat berries again in this life.

247
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,500
What do we do about your leg?

248
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,520
What do we do now?

249
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,140
The car broke down, our phone battery is dead.

250
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,450
There are no vehicles passing by.

251
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,390
That's why I came out to take a look.

252
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,640
Jiashang, I don't think we can make it back tonight.

253
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,380
My car also broke down.

254
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,260
That's good.

255
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,080
It seems my calculations were pretty accurate.

256
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,160
You still have the nerve to joke?

257
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,470
Look at this deserted place, how will we survive the night?

258
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,390
Don't worry. I have a plan.

259
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,900
Fortunately, I participated in a summer camp in Japan and learned a few survival skills.

260
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,030
With limited resources, this is the best I can do.

261
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,550
If I hadn't hurt my leg, I would have built it better than you.

262
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,290
Right, let me clean your wound.

263
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,950
Stop, water is important.

264
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,730
If a human is left with water and no food,

265
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,500
They can survi...

266
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,850
Deal with it. It must be cleaned.

267
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,850
or it might get infected and that would be worse.

268
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,420
It's not just you who's trying to survive.

269
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,060
I just feel bad about the water.

270
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,320
Hold it.

271
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,850
You're pretty skilled.

272
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,330
You forgot? I am a gold volunteer at the animal hospital.

273
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,520
- Those dogs–
-That's enough.

274
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,610
It's so dark.

275
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,290
- Jiashang, let's start a fire?
- No.

276
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,050
- No, I'm scared of the dark.
- I'm scared of fires.

277
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,130
- I'm more scared of the dark.
- I'm more scared of the fire.

278
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,290
- There's no reason for you to fear fire.
- There's no reason for you to fear the dark.

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,420
No, I will light it.

280
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,050
Don't you have a flashlight?

281
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,730
No battery.

282
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,040
There's still fairy lights.

283
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,610
Or else why would you bring them out from the car?

284
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,190
Fairy lights aren't bright enough.

285
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,420
Plus, not only am I afraid of the dark, but I'm also afraid of being cold. I need to start a fire for warmth.

286
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,730
I'll give you my coat.

287
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,930
- I'm hungry, I want grilled fish.
- Where is there any fish?

288
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,670
- Let's go catch one.
- They all went to sleep.

289
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,040
There's always fish that stay up late.

290
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,790
You want to play this game until the death of me, is it?

291
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,390
No.

292
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,930
I just thought to take this opportunity to fix your issues.

293
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:55,120
Let me tell you, this kind of psychological issue can be fixed just by facing your fear once.

294
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,630
Relax, Doctor Su won't charge you.

295
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,300
Are you serious?

296
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,350
It's warm.

297
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,460
See? Even the heavens don't approve of you bullying me.

298
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,380
Why don't we get into the car?

299
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,260
The rain is heavy and the road is far,

300
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,120
and, you hurt your leg. You want me to carry you there?

301
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,690
Good point.

302
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,890
If I hadn't found you here today, what would you have done?

303
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,100
Then I would have drowned in my sorrows.

304
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,750
Why do you have to break up with me when you can't let me go?

305
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,700
You cried so much for me.

306
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,610
Yiyi, I never thought about actually separating from you.

307
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,400
Actually,

308
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,950
I couldn't let you go from my heart.

309
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,490
I...

310
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,380
Will never let go of your hand.

311
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:47,600
♫ I wish you a good life ♫

312
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,260
♫ I understand. I won't reveal it ♫

313
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,170
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose you ♫

314
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,200
♫ I won’t be sad if I don’t lose you ♫

315
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,500
Drink some.

316
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,910
Don't worry.

317
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,590
No bad news is good news.

318
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,300
They are just lost, the island is only so big.

319
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,100
We can go look for them tomorrow morning, we definitely will be able to find them.

320
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,100
Us three, have known each other for twenty or more years now.

321
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,130
Do you remember, when we went to A'Shang's house to play,

322
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,270
you accidentally broke one of his grandpa's favorite antique vases.

323
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,880
A'Shang didn't even hesitate to say he broke it.

324
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,880
Grandpa, in front of us, ruthlessly hit A'Shang twice.

325
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,260
He even had a nose bleed.

326
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,920
After that,

327
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,910
you never dared to go to his house again.

328
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,450
You were also scared to face grandpa.

329
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,980
Actually, I know.

330
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,110
You felt worse than anyone.

331
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,240
You felt even worse than if you yourself had been beaten or scolded.

332
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,730
Jiashang's first lie was to cover for you.

333
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,890
Stop.

334
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,730
Actually, you are more worried about him than anyone else.

335
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,850
He failed to trust me first.

336
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,030
If you think about him, he also had a lot of pressure.

337
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,000
You think he didn't want to tell you?

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,760
He wanted to tell you more than anyone else, also he was more scared than anyone that you would find out.

339
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,580
Even if you have a close relationship,

340
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,070
you still need to carefully protect it.

341
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,910
This is true caring.

342
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,830
I think you can overcome this.

343
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,770
Go back after finishing your drink.

344
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,920
If you come back,

345
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,390
I'll forgive you.

346
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,910
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

347
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:14,790
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

348
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:21,320
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

349
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,820
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

350
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,320
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

351
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:43,150
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

352
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,720
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

353
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,380
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

354
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,420
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

355
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,580
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

356
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,670
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

357
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:24,020
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

358
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,810
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

359
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:36,290
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

360
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,580
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

361
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,720
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

362
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,820
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

363
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,330
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

364
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:58,240
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

365
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,140
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

366
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,900
♫ On the travelling train ♫

367
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,140
♫ You first get off ♫

368
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:18,160
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
