Li Jiashang and Chu Mo already recognized you.

Why didn't he (Zhang Mingda) have any reaction at all?

200
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,910
From what I know, he joined Lee Group in 2003.

201
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,460
At that time I was only seven years old.

Let me tell you. From the start, this woman first got President Chu to take on the show.

206
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,030
She's now starting to seduce CEO Li,

207
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,700
to take over this marketing campaign of new products.

208
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,790
This girl definitely isn't easy to handle. I'd like to see who she is.

What are you doing? Go in.

210

For the proposal, Ming Xiu will go first.

I'm Su Yi. Some people must be very curious

212

how I ended up as the project-in-charge.

213
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,450
In any case, it's not due to telling gossips.

214
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,160
I read the marketing proposal from Lee Group.

215
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,600
Using the repair products from the new product series as our focus,

216
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,240
I think it's too conservative.

217
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,430
I recommend the flawless concealer as our focus.

218
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,560
The demand for cosmetic products is much lower than that of skincare products.

219
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,500
But the prospect of being able to beautify oneself immediately

220
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,290
is much more appealing than a gradual process.

221
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,600
Beauty is a productivity for a long time.

Electronic products use aesthetic designs to increase sales.

Milk tea also improves its appearance to sell better.

224
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,420
If two things are of the same value, then isn't it better to choose the one that looks more appealing?

♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

320
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,600
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

321
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,400
♫ On the travelling train ♫

322
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,500
♫ You first get off ♫

323
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,200
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
