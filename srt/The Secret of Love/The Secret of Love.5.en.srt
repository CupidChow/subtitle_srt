On the second birthday after I got to Japan,

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,920
I received a mysterious letter.

16

I never believed that my father would have fled with funds.

17

Why is the magazine so worn out?

23

Do you know that finding this was harder than getting into Heaven?

24
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,370
Back then, this incident stirred the waters pretty badly.

Lee Group invested funds into this company.

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,820
Mu Feng was suspected of stealing the funds and running away.

But the conclusion regarding the car accident was immediately rejected.

Why is everything about Lee Group?

45

The article states clearly that, in the upcoming magazine, there will be a continuation.

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,800
But, on the release of the new issue, the layout of the magazine was completely changed into an entertainment periodical.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,860
This was for sure Lee Group's intention.

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,690
Then, does Li Jiashang have anything to do with this？

49

Seven years ago he was twenty years old and still studying at university.

CEO Li! Why are you here?

65
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,060
This is something I should ask you!

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Because I like little pets!

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,010
You can try and trick me, but you can't take advantage of them.

68
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,250
Do you have to go that far? You are the kind of person who wouldn't draw water from a well for ten years after being bitten once by a snake.

69
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,760
I previously studied veterinary medicine. I even worked as a volunteer in Japan. And I have just returned.

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,460
However, CEO Li, your family owns such an important business. How do you find time to come here?

71
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,950
This pet clinic is subsidized by me.

72
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,130
In the world of wealthy people, everything can be done.

73

Thank you, CEO Li.

In the past, An An wouldn't let other people touch it.

81
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,350
Why?

82
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,730
When it came here, it was just a stray dog.

83
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,030
Its entire fur was gone.

84
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,610
And no one liked it or wanted it.

85
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,790
Then, every time it was adopted by someone,

86
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,040
it would find some way to run back here.

87
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,930
In the end, it was allowed to stay here and live here.

88
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,810
Probably it found a sense of security in here.

89
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,480
How heartless.

90
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,370
Why couldn't they keep it?

91
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,310
This is for sure a compromising choice one could barely make.

92
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,000
If they had to follow their heart and force it to stay at home,

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,740
its body would only get weaker.

94
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,020
But now it only wants to be next to its owner.

95
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,860
The long-term suffering can't be compared to the short-term suffering.

96
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,950
Sometimes separation is the only proper move.

97
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,310
If they want it to stay alive they should stay together!

98
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,280
If the owner sees it in this condition it will be difficult to bear! What is the purpose?

99
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,770
But who has the heart to let go of their precious pet?

100
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,360
Even though some things are difficult to think through because of our emotions,

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,710
we still have to be rational in the end.

102
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,000
If you want to keep everything close to you,

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,390
then it is called an obsession.

104
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,380
Do you really not have anything you don't ever want to lose?

105
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,430
If you don't irrationally want to own something forever, then you won't lose it.

106
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,980
Being afraid of losing someone and not trying to have that person

107
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,620
is called being a coward.

108
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,740
You said people? People are independent.

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,610
They can't be owned forever by you.

I hope Director Su can give it a younger inspiration.

Seven years ago, it was the first time an international journal reported on Lee Group.

152

It was also the year Lee Group became internationally known.

Afterward, Lee Group collaborated on many international showcases.

Seven years ago, I was in Japan attending college. I went to Waseda University.

159
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,170
After graduating, I worked at a company owned by the Japanese Fuji Group and just recently came back to China. Is there anything else CEO Li would like to ask?

What I wanted to ask is–

161

If CEO Li keeps asking these personal questions, I think I have the right to refuse to answer.

No. It must be just another one of the subsidiary companies that Lee Group has invested in.

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,400
I won't disturb your date any longer.

317
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Goodbye.

318
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,800
You know him?

319
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,700
When I was working on the new product proposal,

320
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,600
I did a comparative analysis of competing companies.

321
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Background research,

322
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,300
well done.

323
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,100
Have a shrimp.

324
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,900
Thank you, CEO Li. I'll help myself.

325
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,800
What is it? Are you allergic to shrimp?

326
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,320
No, I just don't like eating it.

327
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,390
Your younger brother called you just now.

328
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,760
You're not related by blood but are still so close.

329
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,000
CEO Li, I'm really curious about what the secret file

330
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,900
that's locked in the file room really is.

331
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,800
The formulas for celebrity products are at the core of Lee Group.

332
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
So, of course, they require extra protection.

333
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
For my recent project on new products,

334
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,500
I'd like to do a more detailed background research.

335
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,800
I think that's not necessary.

336
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,500
- But CEO Li–
- Li Jiashang.

337
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Your employees are worked to the bone during normal work hours, and now you're occupying their personal time as well?

338
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,400
Aren't you being too exploitative?

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,400
My sister has the worst luck, having a blood-sucking boss like you.

340
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Su Xiangtai, what are you doing here?

341
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,200
If you have something to say, let's go home first.

342
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,300
Excuse me, CEO Li. I'm going home.

343
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go.

344
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
Why did you suddenly... hey!

345
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,400
Xiangtai, I'm talking to you.

346
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Su Xiangtai, listen to your older sister when she speaks.

347
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
Don't–

348
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,530
[Happy Birthday]

349
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,010
Xiangtai.

350
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Xiangtai,

351
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,770
Xiangtai.

352
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
I really was busy today,

353
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,100
and was so tired yesterday, I forgot about this.

354
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,000
It really wasn't on purpose.

355
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Xiangtai, open your door first and talk to me, okay?

356
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Come on. Open the door.

357
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,100
Xiangtai.

358
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,040
I'm sorry, Xiangtai.

359
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
[Happy birthday,]

360
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,600
it's not yet midnight, eat it while it's hot.

361
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,260
CEO Li, I'd still like to request permission to look through the file room.

362
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,700
No, Lee Group invested in the Li Mu Research Institute.

363
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,200
This issue might harm Lee Group's reputation. Li Jiashang definitely won't help me.

364
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,300
I can only rely on myself to figure it out.

365
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,900
To prove my father's innocence,

366
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,400
I really don't have any other way.

367
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Sister, I finished my noodles.

368
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Don't forget to eat breakfast tomorrow.

369
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Kaiyu, it's time to eat.

370
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,600
Ask Director Su.

371
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,200
Director Su, let's go eat.

372
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,700
I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.

373
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,300
Okay.

374
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,520
What are you doing?

375
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,700
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

376
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:16,600
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

377
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,200
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

378
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,690
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

379
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,200
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

380
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,000
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

381
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,600
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

382
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,000
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

383
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,200
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

384
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,300
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

385
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,500
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

386
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,800
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

387
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,600
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

388
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,100
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

389
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,400
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

390
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,500
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

391
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,600
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

392
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,200
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

393
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,000
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

394
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

395
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,800
♫ On the travelling train ♫

396
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,900
♫ You first get off ♫

397
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:20,000
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
