00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,500
[Episode 26]

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,570
You delivered this faster than I expected.

15
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,580
I really can't hide anything from Grandpa.

16
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,110
Who gave you this?

17
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,050
It was Su Yi.

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,080
Don't just look at me.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,310
The ratio for the ingredients is clearly indicated.

20
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,820
This is Lin Zi's new product.

21
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,430
The cost is much more than the profit.

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,160
This is suicidal and stealing.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,970
Also, it's targeting Lee Group's high-end market.

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,040
What do you plan to do?

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,020
Dilute my equities and place them in the Lee Group's option pool.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,770
Just because of such a minor difficulty, you plan to cash out and leave?

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,950
Fool!

28
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,240
You still don't have confidence in me.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,250
This is the time when you disappoint me the most.

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,540
If you keep doing this, you will lose Lee Group.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,850
Chairman Li.

32
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,010
In order to acquire Lee Group's shares, Gao Mu

33
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,700
deliberately used this new product to raise the price of Lin Zi's shares and cash out from this.

34
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,870
- From what I know...
- From what I know,

35
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,540
they are unable to service the loans. The positive impact of the new product is merely superficial.

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,980
As long as he doesn't become the chairman of Lee Group,

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,340
his crazy behavior,

38
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,150
won't stop at all.

39
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,620
I want him to go bankrupt and into liquidation.

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,180
This is like killing the chickens to get the eggs. What if your shares are bought by someone else?

41
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,470
Gao Mu will still buy them back at a higher price.

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,920
Why are you so confident?

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,320
I'm the one who's directly fighting with Lin Zi.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,740
At his time, he might mention Luo Group.

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,240
You can say whatever you like. I still think it's more reliable to collaborate with Luo Group.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,120
I will say, do you still remember my father?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,460
When he was alive, he was at your disposal to make you happy.

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,660
But I'm not him.

49
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,740
Also,

50
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,280
Gao Mu has never been an uncle to me.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,130
Take care of yourself.

52
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,950
Chairman Li, do you want to call Doctor Zhao?

53
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,650
No need.

54
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,080
Jiashang is finally up to the mark.

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,340
I thought you left.

56
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,450
It's ok if you're afraid to open it. Who doesn't have something they're afraid to touch?

57
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,770
Because you are here, didn't I make a breakthrough in more than twenty years too?

58
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,240
However, remember this. When you want to open this, I will be here too.

59
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,810
Have you ever thought that Grandpa could change too?

60
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,990
Why don't you try another way to get along with Grandpa?

61
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,570
I will try to open this.

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,000
Xiangtai said as long as there is the right temperature, concentration, catalyst, etc.,

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,810
everything can change qualitatively.

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,380
Okay. I'm going to see him tomorrow anyways.

65
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,110
I can consult him.

66
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,150
Oh my God!

67
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,170
This is good. This diamond is big and there are many.

68
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,780
- Choose this.
- This is too plain.

69
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,580
My mom wore this when she got married.

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,050
This one.

71
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,940
This is our customized model. The price is...

72
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay. No problem!

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,990
Then the size is...

74
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,310
This one.

75
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,870
Okay.

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
Remember to treat me to a feast.

77
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,030
What kind of identity should I use to treat you to a feast?

78
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,990
Forget it if you don't want to treat me. Anyway, my sister hasn't said yes to you yet.

79
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,680
The feast will be gone then.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Brother-in-law.

81
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,860
- Brother-in-law.
- Yes.

82
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,230
I know of a great French restaurant that just opened.

83
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,340
- Okay.
- Good.

84
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,310
By the way, eat more later. Don't save money for me, okay?

85
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,900
From what I know, Li Jiashang is buying a ring.

86
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,940
That's why you want to take down Li Yaohui?

87
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,050
If I settle Grandpa, I will feel at ease.

88
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,960
Otherwise, he will have a poker face every day, like he wants his grandson's life.

89
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,330
Grandpa is right.

90
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,950
Don't you also take his life?

91
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,790
What life? You are pregnant too?

92
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,820
Who is pregnant?

93
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,950
Then when are you getting married?

94
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,840
I haven't asked you yet.

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,900
How do you plan to settle Grandpa?

96
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,780
Marriage is between two people. Why do you both make it so complicated?

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,680
First, I must make that elder

98
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,540
give up on the other candidates.

99
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,660
Grandpa, don't be angry.

100
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,270
I haven't visited you since you got discharged. It's Jiashang's fault.

101
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,470
He wants me to be the CEO's assistant.

102
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,710
Manni, I say work will never be completed.

103
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,340
It's better to spend more time researching humans

104
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,770
and differentiate what's right and wrong.

105
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,150
- I'm tired.
- Grandpa!

106
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,740
This time I am serious.

107
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,860
I really love Xiangtai.

108
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,710
He's a responsible and

109
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,260
considerate man.

110
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,740
And also an honest,

111
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,190
innocent and passionate boy.

112
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,140
Grandpa, I know that Manni is precious to you.

113
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,690
I also know that you think I'm too young,

114
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,630
but you are doing this for her own sake.

115
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,370
I... I really...

116
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,020
Grandpa, Xiangtai is not good at talking.

117
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,090
Actually, he's very outstanding.

118
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,240
He's still applying for his doctorate. His mentor is also second to none.

119
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,210
Moreover, his parents are still in Japan.

120
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,590
There won't be any conflict between mother-in-law and me.

121
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,750
Besides, I get along very well with his older sister.

122
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,200
Nothing else? That's it?

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
I won't leave her!

124
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,630
Grandpa, drink this tea while it's still hot.

125
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,750
Grandpa.

126
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,650
[Su Yi]

127
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,170
Sister?

128
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,840
- Grandpa.
- Take a seat.

129
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,200
Manni is going to be Su Yi's sister-in-law instead.

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,460
Although Manni can't be my daughter-in-law,

131
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,900
she's still my granddaughter.

132
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,580
Don't tell me you want to be my granddaughter's brother-in-law?

133
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,800
Your relationships are really messy. I really don't understand.

134
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,470
Grandpa, no matter what you say,

135
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,690
Manni and I will treat you well.

136
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,080
You are so talkative.

137
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,480
Regarding the company,

138
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,360
just do whatever you want.

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,710
I've already retired.

140
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,130
I don't want to think about it.

141
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,220
However,

142
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,620
if there's anything you can't handle,

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,350
you better not look for me.

144
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,240
Regardless of favors or collaboration from Luo Group,

145
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,540
they can still be used.

146
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,330
Manni's workload can be moderately reduced.

147
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,020
If she reduces her workload, she'll have too much free time to mess around.

148
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,400
She's not even you.

149
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,460
Chairman Li, dinner is ready.

150
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,400
Grandpa, let's eat first, there is a guest waiting.

151
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,390
I expected this a long time ago.

152
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,690
Since it's so lively here, I don't need to be here.

153
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,850
I don't have an appetite. I don't feel like eating.

154
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,030
Chairman Li.

155
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,360
Grandpa!

156
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,870
Didn't you say to take it slow?

157
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,000
Sorry!

158
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,660
However, please listen to me.

159
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,400
It wasn't easy for Jiashang and I to be together.

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,550
You know about the amount of difficulties and obstacles that have been overcome.

161
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,410
Isn't this the way you have been teaching Jiashang?

162
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,650
