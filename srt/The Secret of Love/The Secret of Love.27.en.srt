I know about that model. That year only three were sold.

151
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,960
Every component had a serial number. This consumer didn't need after sales,

152
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,290
so, at the time we, with confidence,

153
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,460
didn't keep a record.

154

Nothing more?

155
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,770
Then Manager Fan, your family drama, should I publicize it?

156
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,560
In these types of situations, I always bring the documents back home.

157

Fear of them falling into the public's hands.

158
