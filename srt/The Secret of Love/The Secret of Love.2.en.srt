CEO Li, good morning.

16

I'm Ming Xiu's Creative Director, Su Yi.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,120
Director Su, where your creativity comes from?

18
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,470
Of course, good creativity comes from conflicts,

19
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,630
and a one-week deadline.

20

Since your proposal hasn't been set,

Chairman Li, how about we just use Ming Xiu's?

22
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,210
Not ready? Then what proposals are we comparing?

23

It is set. After all, this design is Director Su's idea.

CEO Li, I owe you an apology and an explanation.

Unnecessary. Fool me once, shame on you.

Fool me twice, shame on me.

There have been five attempts in two months, a total of twelve proposals.

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,750
Every proposal is above the industry average, but you reject it every time.

44
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,200
You completely squeeze dry Ming Xiu's ability.

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,580
You obviously want to sacrifice Ming Xiu in the Lee Group's internal conflict.

CEO Li, to you,

47

Ming Xiu may just be a tool and bargaining chip.

But to Ming Xiu's employees,

this is our career and pursuit.

don't worry about your pride. If you continue to delay it,

164
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,130
this show will be canceled.

165
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,830
- Hello? Where are you?
- I'm at the front.

171
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,680
Oh, no! Oh, no! The clothes got ruined!

172
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,110
Isn't there a backup?

173
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,820
When I went to look for it, there was only this one.

Let me see.

175
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,570
Editor, I have an idea.

176
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,220
Do I really have to wear this?

177
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,000
If I wear this, I can't even move.

Be good. Listen.

leave a phone number.

Don't you have a girlfriend?

188
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,120
Also, she is a little chubby.

189

After all, you are not picky.

190
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,700
Let's watch the show, everyone on stage is skinny.

191
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,480
Sister Su Yi, it really was great earlier.

192
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,600
It looks like our hard work was not in vain.

193

The good show is yet to come.

194
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,660
Really not bad, you are really something.

195
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,050
Thank you for your compliment, Sister Feilin.

196
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,330
I didn't do it on purpose! I'll go get you something to wipe it off.

197
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,990
Wait for me.

198

So full of herself.

199

Sister Su Yi, what should we do?

200
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,790
It's okay.

Watch the lighting room, don't let some people get near.

If you do this, people who don't know will think why did I...

The success of Li's show this time is mostly because of Ming Xiu.

206
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,960
And I, as a Li person who has cooperated with Ming Xiu for over ten years, personally think—

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,520
I heard the success of this show relies on the new Director Su.

208

Nobody knows,

209
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,960
but the success of the show is mostly thanks to Vice President Zhang.

210
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:23,260
After all, this show is Vice President Zhang's perfect curtain call.

211
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,090
As a representative of Lee Group,

212
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,330
I thank Vice President Zhang's hard work all these years.

213
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,160
To reciprocate, I just so happen to have a small present to give you.

214
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,990
This is Zhang Mingda's transactions with Ming Xiu all these years.

215
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,630
This should be enough for us to be on good terms again.
