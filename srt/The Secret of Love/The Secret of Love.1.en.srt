22
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,890
Lee Group, Ocean City's most famous cosmetics company, has seen steady performance improvement every day in the past year.

23
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,980
Its domestic market share has progressively increased over the years,

and its growth overseas is even more rapid.

25
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,480
The chairman of Lee Group, Li Yaohui, built the business from the ground up and has been managing it for the past 50 years.

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,020
The latest rumors indicate that the almost-70-year-old Li hopes soon to hand over the reins and take on more of an advisory role.

27
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,850
Opinions vary widely as to whom will be his successor. However, the majority believe Li Yaohui's sole grandson,

28
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,010
the newly-appointed Director Li Jiashang, will assume the role.

29

Li Jiashang, 27 years old, completed a postgraduate program at Columbia University

30
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,770
and took on the role of CEO upon returning from abroad. He initiated preparations for the Lee Group's annual cosmetics show,

31
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,560
which was organized in collaboration with the fashion magazine Ming Xiu, their long-time partner.

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,470
Since Li Jiashang became the CEO, his style of work has been harsh and merciless,

and he has laid off a large number of employees and brought in new ones.

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,360
- Like this mural...
- What's going on?

322
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,530
Their proposal has the same theme as ours,

323
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,030
but the proposal is more mature.

324
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,930
- For the cosmetics show this time,
- Theirs is exactly the same as ours.

325
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,260
we can incorporate the features of East Asian faces

326
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,970
to show a perfect combination of traditional Chinese and Western arts.

327
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,960
It'll definitely attract more young people.

328
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,230
Okay, that's my content for today. Thanks everyone.

329
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,740
Okay, Jiashang, it's your turn.

330
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,870
We're not ready yet.

331
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,390
What are you messing around?

332
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,780
You don't have even a single proposal?

333
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,910
Chen Jin, did you make this proposal?

334
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,460
No. It was made by our creative director.

335
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,410
CEO Li, good morning.

336
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,770
I'm Ming Xiu's Creative Director, Su Yi.

337
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,120
Got you.

338
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,320
Li Jiashang arrives at work before 8:00 a.m. every day to handle the company's matters.

339
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,580
He then leaves at 9:00 p.m, and doesn't engage in any recreation or hobbies.

340
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,920
If he has any social engagements, he only goes to his own restaurant,

341
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,920
One Secret, and he's always accompanied by Zheng He.

342
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,750
But this person, at dawn, likes to...

343
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,600
Every morning he drives his car to the convenience store

344
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,790
so he can eat instant noodles with whiskey.

345
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,670
He's saved many Joy Division songs.

346
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,970
He's pressed 'like' on one of Klimt's paintings, "Love".

347
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,840
Compared to "Love", I prefer "Kiss".

348
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,240
Since Li Jiashang is so afraid of fire, he might as well go and open an office on a glacier at the North Pole.

349
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,630
[Weakness: afraid of fire]

350
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,270
[Information about CEO Li. Arrives office before 8:00 a.m. Leaves office after 9:00 p.m. Likes to hang out at convenience store. Only goes to his own restaurant (One Secret)...]

351
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:38,000
Now, I just need someone to vouch for me.

352
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,590
This is my phone number, contact me anytime.

353
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,870
- Actually–
- Don't worry about it sis. We're the same kind of people. I get it.

354
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,170
[Gao Dingli]

355
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,540
Because of the power conflict between Lee Group's old and new,

356
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,120
this proposal competition is bound to be unfair.

357
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,920
In order to ensure Ming Xiu is not innocently sacrificed, even if I have to face the consequences,

358
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,200
I won't hesitate.

359
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,130
