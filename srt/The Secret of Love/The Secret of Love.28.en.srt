Morning, everyone.

169
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,850
CEO Li, you should sit here.

170
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,490
My equity shares are still in the option pool.

171
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,960
Lee Group's biggest shareholder was my grandpa. It's more appropriate for me to sit here.

172
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,680
Today's meeting—

Why is he here? What's going on?

- What's going on?
- No idea.

What's going on?

It's not appropriate for you to sit there.

Even if CEO Li discharged his equity shares,

old chairman's portion will be his sooner or later.

The biggest shareholder is still CEO Li.

180
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,090
It should be Chairman Gao.

What's going on?

182
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,450
Yes. What's going on?

183
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm grateful to my father, Li Yaohui, for having faith in me.

184
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,010
I thank him for leaving his equities to me.

185
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,280
Lin Zi recently purchased all odd lots of Lee Group in the market,

186
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,770
and also, with my dear nephew's generosity,

187
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,320
I'm currently holding the most shares in Lee Group.

188
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,810
Really?

189
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,200
How did he get that many? What about CEO Li?

190
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,190
That's right.

191
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,050
I have decided to set up a dedicated charity fund for cardiology

192
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,110
to comfort my deceased father who's in heaven.

Chairman Gao, congratulations.

194
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,610
I hope that Lin Zi's loan will not drag everyone down.

Withdraw those new products immediately from the shelves and leave Lee Group.

198
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,170
I will settle your deficit.

199
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,690
Leave? I earned them with my ability. Why do I need to leave?

200
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,130
Do you know why Lee Group

201
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,840
has never gotten involved in the low-end markets?

202
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,760
Because of me?
