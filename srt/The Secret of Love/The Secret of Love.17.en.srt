[Lee Group's QiXi Short Video Plan]
(T/N: QiXi is China's 2nd Valentine's day. It's on the 7th day of the 7th month in the lunar year)

[Short Video Marketing Plan]

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,570
You must be tired from working overtime these past few days.

17
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,000
QiXi is an important time for marketing.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,920
We have to hold onto the attention of the press conference and solidify the brand's image.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,340
If this goes well, I can put an end to all the gossip

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,990
and let everyone know that

21
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,850
I, Su Yi, did not enter Lee Group just because of you.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,780
I was thinking,

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,780
do I like you being devastatingly cute,

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,730
or do I like you being focused on work?

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,650
You don't have to worry about making a decision quickly,

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,730
because I have many more variations of me that you haven't seen yet.

27
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,340
Okay, serious talk.

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,550
Li Xiatian's advertisement contract has already been signed,

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,660
but we are missing a male lead. Take a look.

30
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,860
I don't know if this is a benefit

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,380
or pressure.

32
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,510
Then give me the benefit of choosing a male lead,

33
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,440
so you won't be jealous.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,990
I now worry for these boys.

35
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,410
I heard that Manager Luo just returned from studying abroad.

36
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,480
Coincidentally, I prepared a self-introduction in English.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,370
We need people who can speak Chinese.

Why is Su Xiangtai still not here? Are you sure you contacted him?

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,210
I contacted him myself.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,520

45
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,740

- Did our little Xiangtai eat yet?
- I already ate.

48
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,970
I heard our company has a QiXi short video confession project?

49
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,820
Yes. What? Do you want to join?

50
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,560
Join? When have I, Luo Manni, just merely joined a project?

51
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,300
I... want to be one of the trending topics.

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,350
Sis, I'm done preparing the food.

53
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,280
I'll leave first.

54
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,640

Okay, fine.

57
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,580
For men, age does not affect their shamelessness,

58
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,600
childishness, and selfishness.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,830
So I might as well find someone I like,

This is the same as what we thought.

From the reports, Mu Feng is definitely the most suspicious.

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,780
Right.

114
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,410

If Su Yi knows that Mu Feng was not corrupt,

121
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,120
then she will investigate even further.

122

My father was not corrupt, right?

Just do it. I have my own plans.

Right. It's just like what we thought.

125

My father really was innocent.

126

If I hadn't lost my memory,

I would have remembered what happened during the car accident,

Jiashang, if you told me

this is the place we had our first date,

140
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,660
I would say that the environment is great, but

don't you think that the wind is a little strong?

Even your hair got messy.

Being young was great. I ate all these high-calorie foods without a worry.

146
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,900
At that time, this was a single-person portion for you.

147
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,670
You could not stop eating and could not stop going on tangents,

148
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,210
I thought you did not want me to confess.

149
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,180
I remember that we had known each other for six years at that time.

150
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,400
If the confession had failed

151
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,830
maybe we wouldn't even have been able to stay as friends.

152
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,860
What happened after? Did you succeed?

153

You'll find out later.

This song is for the beautiful Miss Su Yi.

155

♫ is like a moth to a flame ♫

164
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,640
♫ Being greedy and stubborn ♫

♫ Like the withering spring before the summer ♫

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,910

169
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,030
Jiashang.

170
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,360
I want to be your girlfriend.

171
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,860
Say yes! Say yes!

172
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,190
Be together. A kiss.

173
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,900
Be together.

174
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,690

177
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,090
It's honestly so beautiful.

178
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,990
Right now, it feels like I can forget everything

179
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,580
and only focus on enjoying.

180
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,650
Jiashang, if I hadn't returned

181
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,460
and stayed in Japan, what would you have done?

182
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,870
What can I do?

183
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm not dead stock.

184
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,450
Don't fool around, I'm driving.

185
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,940
If you hadn't returned,

186
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,360
I would have been very unhappy.

187
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,290
Without you, I would have lived like a robot every day.

188
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,880
There's no need to be involved with anyone else,

189
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,160
since you are my one and only.

190
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,360
Yiyi, I truly love you a lot.

191
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

192
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,510
Jiashang, let me ask you a very serious question.

193
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,890
If a girl licked your ice cream like this,

194
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,030
what would you do?

195
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,530
Absolutely no girl has a chance of getting that close to me.

196
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,790
Let's go.

197
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,160
These past few days, it feels like I'm in two romantic relationships.

198
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
One is mine,

199
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,640
one is Mu Xiao's.

200
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,260
Yeah. I feel like I have pursued you twice.

201
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,310
I don't feel like I got the short end of the stick. I willingly did so.

202
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,980
Jiashang, being with you is very special.

203
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,980
You might find it hard to understand how

204
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,320
right now,

205
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,650
looking at the stars and not thinking about anything,

206
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,060
quietly being with you,

207
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,480
is so precious to me.

208
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,000
I feel truly relaxed.

209
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,760
Yiyi, after being with you,

210
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,540
I am not the old Jiashang anymore.

211
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,720
Will you change again?

212
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,260
Yiyi, the car accident caused you to lose your father,

213
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,720
and it also caused me to lose you.

214
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,850
In this incident, you're not the only victim.

215
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,720
Even without this incident, people will inevitably change.

216
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,480
Do you not understand romance?

217
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
Can't you say more loving words?

218
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,080
Do you know what I want to do right now?

219
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,210
- Hello?
- Hello Su Yi, hurry up and call me a genius.

220
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,980
What did you find?

221
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Let me show you.

222
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,600
I sent it to your phone, take a look for yourself.

223
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,000
If you just look at this photo, there's nothing wrong with it.

224
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,880
But when I enlarged it for a comparison,

225
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,990
you can find that the serial number on page 8 is lighter than the serial numbers on other pages.

226
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,930
Then I found traces of editing.

227
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,280
Which means someone changed the 9th page of the body donation records

228
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,740
into the 8th page.

229
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,520
The original 8th page is missing.

230
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,520
It's possible that the missing one

231
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,000
is about the body mentioned in the autopsy.

232
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,290
Right, what you thought is correct.

233
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,120
The number of people who falsified evidence,

234
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,790
stole the body, and covered up the truth,

235
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,930
can be counted with one hand.

236
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,200
What's wrong?

237
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,930
It's a bit chilly here on the mountain.

238
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,680
Then let's go down.

239
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,390
Stop the car.

240
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,180
What's wrong?

241
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,360
I think this is where the car accident happened all those years ago.

242
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,560
How do you know?

243
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,740
I familiarized myself with the location of the accident,

244
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,290
I just never had the courage to come here.

245
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,630
But I remember, the location of the car accident was never made public.

246
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,920
- Who told you?
- Uncle Zhang told me.

247
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,880
He said that at the time, there were no witnesses or evidence.

248
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,430
All traces of the crash pointed towards an accident.

249
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,360
The police, after numerous investigations,

250
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,200
treated the crash as a traffic accident.

251
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,530
Can you remember anything?

252
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,720
If I could remember anything,

253
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,160
even just a little bit,

254
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,170
I wouldn't be as passive as I am now.

255
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,240
Let's go. If you can't remember, then don't keep trying.

256
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,760
I believe that if your father saw you right now,

257
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,970
he would be very gratified.

258
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:42,050
Jiashang, there's a place that I want you to go with me.

259
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,680
Okay.

260
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,330
[Laboratory 1]

261
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,260
Why did we have to come here?

262
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,910
How come I can't remember anything?

263
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,370
Don't run away, Mu Xiao!

264
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,650
What is wrong? Let's go.

265
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,570
Yiyi, it's all my fault.

266
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,190
I shouldn't have taken you there.

267
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,620
It's not your fault.

268
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,030
I only dared to go there because you were with me.

269
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,640
Yiyi, don't worry about it.

270
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,870
No matter what, I will always be by your side.

271
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,500
Jiashang, the place from my nightmares where I get chased by someone,

272
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,600
really resembles that corridor from the laboratory.

273
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,670
I have a feeling that

274
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,270
my last memory

275
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,350
didn't happen at the scene of the car crash.

276
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,020
But, instead, at the research institute.

277
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,590
- Uncle Gao.
- (Breathe) In...

278
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,610
- You actually–
- (Breathe) Out.

279
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,350
Uncle Gao, are you really not hot?

280
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,900
I am! Because your heart is not quiet enough!

281
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,090
By the way... what is the matter?

282
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,710
I have found something in Doctor Zheng's office.

283
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,910
That injury report of yours...

284
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,420
seven years ago I found out that Zheng Yi printed a copy of it.

285
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,470
Although I suspected something was wrong, I didn't have substantial proof. I couldn't tell whether you were alive or dead.

286
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,600
So that's why you have always been keeping an eye on him.

287
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,080
Your autopsy report is a time bomb.

288
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,810
If it is not carefully detonated, none of us will be safe.

289
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,560
Then, I still have some news you might want to hear.

290
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,780
Su Yi went to Lin Zi Group.

291
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,870
The place from my nightmares where I get chased by someone

292
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,690
really resembles that corridor from the laboratory.

293
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,500
This is the register of the teachers who did research.

294
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,950
Carefully look at the last page. The number has been changed.

295
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,100
The place where page nine should have been got changed to page eight.

296
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,050
This means that there is one page missing.

297
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,680
I'm speculating this is where my replacement came from.

298
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,710
Where did you get this from?

299
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,760
From Li Mu Research Institute.

300
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,250
As the person in charge, do you have any impressions?

301
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,780
That day, from what I remember, the weather was not bad.

302
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,890
Chairman Li and Jiashang came to the research institute together.

303
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,710
Lee Group hardly visited the institute.

304
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,330
Moreover, both of them were coming.

305
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,340
So it made a strong impression.

306
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,910
When the corpse was transported and being received,

307
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,920
I was having tea with the Chairman.

308
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,700
Jiashang was more interested in the research institute,

309
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,750
so he wasn't there that day.

310
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,990
When they left, I noticed that in the document they gave me,

311
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,580
the page number had already been changed to 8.

312
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,210
You must make sure to keep this document safe.

313
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,810
If you want to drag the Chairman into this,

314
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,690
you must make sure you never expose yourself, and Jiashang.

315
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,590
But based on your current relationship with Jiashang,

316
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,360
even if you want to tell him that you are Mu Xiao

317
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,060
and want to know about Lee Group, I'm guessing he won't give you a hard time.

318
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,820
Don't worry. I know my limits.

319
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,610
Su Yi! I saw your car!

320
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,180
I'm waiting for you next to your car.

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
Where are you running to?

323
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,760
Do we know each other?

324
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,390
If you want to find out more about Lee Group,

325
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,570
I know more than the people inside.

326
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,050
If I am to ask you directly,

327
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,420
how could you tell me everything?

328
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,760
This will depend on whether I'm satisfied with your answer to my question.

329
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,700
Why are you here?

330
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,690
I'm looking for Ding Hang.

331
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,780
- How did you know I was here?
- Why did you come to meet Gao Mu by yourself?

332
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,390
I am asking you again. How did you know I was here?

333
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,340
Do you know the meaning of what you said last night?

334
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,260
You weren't in the car at the time of the accident. Instead, you went missing at the Li Mu Research Institute.

335
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,460
Gao Mu is related to this.

336
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,960
Just based on your groundless speculation?

337
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,030
Li Jiashang, Gao Mu's your uncle after all.

338
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,120
Let me tell you. The person in charge of Li Mu Research Institute was Gao Mu.

339
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,660
Let me tell you too. The ones who can reach out to meddle in the institute

340
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,940
include your grandfather.

341
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,320
- Su Yi...
- Li Jiashang, you can think of your family's interests,

342
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,510
but please allow me to keep my objectivity.

343
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,010
Su Yi!

344
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,640
There's a GPS installed in this.

345
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,640
I don't need a gift like this one!

346
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,790
Why didn't you tell me you found the autopsy report?

347
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,120
I have got so committed to you.

348
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,370
Why don't you trust me still?

349
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,490
- It's not like that–
- The reason you infiltrated into Lee Group and got closer to me

350
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,760
was just to use me?

351
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,460
If this is really the truth as you said, I can be much more relaxed.

352
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,500
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

353
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,540
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

354
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,020
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

355
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:06,340
♫ No longer being gently side by side ♫

356
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:13,020
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

357
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:20,830
♫ Coincidentally, become insincere ♫

358
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,430
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

359
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:32,820
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

360
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:41,060
My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

361
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:48,220
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

362
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,330
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

363
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:01,560
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

364
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:08,470
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

365
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,990
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

366
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,160
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

367
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,390
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

368
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,420
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

369
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,990
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

370
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:35,840
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

371
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,840
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

372
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,610
♫ On the travelling train ♫

373
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,680
♫ You first get off ♫

374
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:55,140
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
