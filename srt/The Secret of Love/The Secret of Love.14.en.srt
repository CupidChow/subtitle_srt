[The Secret of Love]

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,390
[Episode 14]

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,830
We have Teacher Jin, who has ten million followers, here with us at the live streaming at Ming Xiu.

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,890
Let's trouble Teacher Jin to bring over our new products

16
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,210
to show everyone.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,300
Something is wrong. There's a problem with the monitor.

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,810
Cut!

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Are you okay?

20
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,130
What's wrong?

21
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,150
You're ugly. You're ugly and have scars.

22
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,620
An ugly freak. An ugly freak with scars!

23
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,510
An ugly freak. An ugly freak with scars!

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,170
Who's responsible for the Powerpoint this time?

25
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,980
I asked Sister Feilin to double check it.

26
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,160
- Where is she?
- I'll go look for her.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,880
So you all don't need to work anymore, right?

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,680
Go, go, go.

29
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,050
It's not the time to find who's responsible.

30
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,170
Jiashang, hurry and go back to Lee Group.

31
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,660
I don't want Lee Group to be involved.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,940
Chen Jin!

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,460
- Sister Yi.
- What's going on outside now?

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,140
The live streaming got stopped just in time. The screenshots spreading across the internet are also very blurry,

35
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,380
but they can still tell that was you.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,690
Oh no! Sister Su Yi, look!

37
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,680
Right now, immediately use Ming Xiu's official blog to make a statement.

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Wait a second! The official blog is not your personal Weibo account!

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,830
According to the procedure, the Editor-in-Chief has to agree.

40
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,090
Oh right. Sister Meng is on a business trip, her plane just took off. I'm guessing that she'll arrive this afternoon.

41
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,450
Just wait then. We have to do things according to the rules.

42
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,080
We can't wait anymore.

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,880
We will miss the golden recovery time.

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,130
I'll take responsibility for this.

45
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,200
Tell the public relations department to suspend this live streaming,

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,300
because of technical issues.

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,460
Ming Xiu also issued a statement.

48
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,310
That picture is a photoshop effect that we used.

49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,450
Follow up with the discussion. Let Ming Xiu lead it.

50
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,030
To show our apology, in the next two days,

51
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,920
all products of Lee Group will be 20% off.

52
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,220
Sister Su Yi, good news.

53
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,580
Suddenly, there are several news about the new shows of A-list actors and their romantic rumors online.

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,380
The previous attention on us has now shifted!

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,690
This time I have put out all the news I have.
[1. Du Shuang, hunk born after 2000, had a romantic rumor]
[2. Popular actor Fu Haitao started shooting a new movie]...

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,310
It's settled then. The ambassador for Lee Group's high-end products

57
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,420
must be our artist.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,320
Don't worry, Director Tang. I already sent the contract over.

59
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,670
Sister Su Yi, wake up, are you okay?

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,990
Su Yi, are you feeling better? Do you want to ice it?

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,850
Director Su, what are you looking for? The photo?

62
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,930
I dislike you, I even think you're not qualified to like CEO Li.

63
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,370
I did pity you a bit when Luo Manni appeared.

64
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,350
But now...

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,350
Let's talk about business.

66
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,790
First of all, purposely destroying the live streaming between Lee Group and Ming Xiu, causing damage to their reputation.

67
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,490
Second, maliciously sending personal pictures without permission.

68
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,450
You have to have evidence when accusing someone.

69
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
There were so many people when you fainted that day. On what basis do you think it was me?

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,920
Did I say the photo was taken when I fainted?

71
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,830
Is it wrong to have a good memory? Besides,

72
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,920
if I wanted to expose your fake face,

73
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,660
do I have to go through so much trouble? I can just splash water on you.

74
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,950
Thanks for the reminder.

75
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,100
Sister Yi.

76
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,660
Chen Jin.

77
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,810
I'm not feeling well, so I'm going to leave early. If there's something you need, feel free to contact me.

78
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,210
Sister Yi, how about I go with you? You definitely mustn't take to heart the things people say about you online.

79
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,840
A scar is nothing.

80
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,250
Don't worry, I'm fine.

81
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,360
The scarred face of Ming Xiu's director is exposed. It is not photoshopped.

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,010
Sister Yi, let's clarify it.

83
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,580
They are spreading rumors.

84
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,940
They are not rumors. It's my photo.

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,400
Sister Yi, the Lee group has also made a statement that your photo was maliciously exposed,

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,620
and you're also a victim.

87
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,260
I can't get Jiashang involved anymore.

88
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,090
CEO Li, you're here. Would you like anything to drink?

89
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,810
Su Yi,

90
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,930
let's go.

91
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,670
Don't follow me.

92
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,070
♫ There aren't many affectionate people anymore ♫

93
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,280
Sanbao, stop Su Yi at the entrance. Hurry.

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,660
Did you hear about it? Su Yi has a scar on her face.

95
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,860
- Really?
- It is true!

96
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,150
- I'll tell you.
- Stop talking. Let's go.

97
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,060
Let's go.

98
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,050
♫  I know I am never sober  ♫

99
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,220
Yiyi.

100
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,780
Let's go back home.

101
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,410
I'm here.

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,740
♫  I can't see it through nor let it go  ♫

103
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,000
Yiyi. Yiyi? Get on.

104
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,780
♫ I love you more than he does ♫

105
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,130
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

106
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll drive us.

107
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,970
Yangyang, I'm all right, you should go to work.

108
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,330
I took the day off.

109
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,100
Sis!

110
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,540
Sis, are you ok?

111
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,540
Xiangtai, you have an exam in the afternoon, you should head back.

112
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,770
Sis, I'll stay with you.

113
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,710
If you feel sad just cry and let it out.

114
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,770
I'm fine.

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,350
I just want to be alone for a while.

116
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,380
Let's go. I'll take you there. Let's go.

117
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,960
No, we can't. We can't let her be alone.

118
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,390
She knows that we wouldn't mind so what your sister needs now

119
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,040
is not us.

120
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Let's go.

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,150
That picture, is actually real.

122
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,300
I was her university classmate in Japan. Once,

123
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,310
when she put her hair up and showed her scar,

124
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,980
she even scared a guy away.

125
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,090
Why are you looking at me?

126
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,280
You're prettier than the flowers.

127
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,770
♫  The cold wind can’t tell the time and season  ♫

128
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:36,620
♫  Looking out the street with warm sun and few people ♫

129
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,450
♫  Forget how many days not socializing with people  ♫

130
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,700
♫  If the sky isn’t dark, I wouldn’t have discovered  ♫

131
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,580
Su Yi, open the door please?

132
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,980
♫  The room is empty  ♫

133
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,260
♫  The sky is sunny  ♫

134
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,800
♫  Less incited hearts, the heavy past  ♫

135
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,640
♫  My intuition makes me born to be humble  ♫

136
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,510
♫  I'm not considered special, perhaps it is a kind of test  ♫

137
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,860
♫  Day and night, I try to make this world pure  ♫

138
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,810
♫  Can you be like this, don't disturb me today?  ♫

139
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,490
Geez.

140
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,420
Your bro is already like that, and you're still playing games.

141
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,320
Love is difficult to maintain, but games can truly capture one's heart.

142
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,910
That's enough.

143
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,010
No, it's just a scar. Why do girls care so much?

144
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,770
It's not about the scar, but the scar that affected her whole life.

145
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,400
Later, she learned how to use makeup and became the campus belle. She received many confession letters,

146
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,790
but she didn't even look at them and threw them away.

147
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,250
Because she thinks men like her

148
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,810
only because of her looks.

149
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,210
Why would she think like that?

150
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,530
We look at the face first, but we also look...

151
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,470
at the body. That's not what I meant!

152
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,520
Even though we look at appearance, we also look at other features.

153
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,350
Being smart is beauty, right?

154
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,830
Beautiful your foot! After experiencing this,

155
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,970
it makes Su Yi think that she'll only deserve love if she's pretty.

156
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,600
If you have a scar, then I'll also go get one.

157
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,810
We can get couple's scars. Then both of us will look fierce, how's that?

158
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,390
I'll give you a scar—

I could never forget

160
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,110
how that boy looked at me.

161
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,530
Seems like I didn't deserve

162
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,560
his liking towards me.

163
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,720
The feeling of being deceived

164
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,660
became hatred in his eyes.

165
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,230
It's like when you see something ugly.

166
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,050
You will develop a type of disgust from the bottom of your heart.

167

Step by step, coming here,

169
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,290
I used to treat my appearance as a weapon,

170
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,460
now I caused myself to be badly defeated.

171
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:14,510
Jiashang, everytime you ask me if I'm Mu Xiao,

172
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,530
I'm thinking, yes,

173
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,660
but I'm also not. After the car accident,

174
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,800
I don't have Mu Xiao's memories nor her complete face.

175
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,310
But I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

176
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,560
So I give the choice all to you.

177
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,930
After five minutes, I will open the door.

178
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,270
You can choose right now to stay, or leave.

If you leave,

I mind that you always think about nonsense and put so much pressure on yourself.
