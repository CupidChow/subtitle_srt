00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,240
On the second birthday after I got to Japan,

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,780
I received a mysterious letter.

16
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,940
I never believed that father would run away with funds.

17
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,170
This girl isn't me.

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,580
If this person is not you, then how did they get away with the autopsy?

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,440
Hence, someone must have faked the report.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,530
We must start from

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,050
the autopsy report.

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,290
Okay. Ding Hang found

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,400
the name and picture of the medical examiner who conducted my father's autopsy.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,700
Zheng Yi. He's the department head of our hospital,

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,480
and also...

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,910

Here.

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,950
Uncle Zhang, have you heard of a person called Zheng Yi?

31
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,320
Zheng Yi? I don't think I've heard of this name.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,880
- What's wrong?
- After father's car accident,

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,360
no one mentioned any disagreement about the cause of death.

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,610
Until Father's colleague called Zhu Yue

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,460
continuously raised some doubts about this.

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,180
He looked for a third-party morgue to complete the autopsy.

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,000
The forensic doctor at the time was Zheng Yi.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,260
If one wants to fake an autopsy report,

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,610
it's not that easy.

40

As for how many people are implicated in your father's case,

I have no idea, too.

However, it has been such a long time since this event already.

By the way, there's still...

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,880
Luo Manni.

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,190
Is she doing this because of work

168
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,870
or is she deliberately giving me a hard time?

169

- Frankly, Manni is...
- You don't need to explain.

You know each other?

Older Sister Xia Tian, why didn't you let me pick you up when you came back to China?

175
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,020
I wanted to give you a surprise in advance.

Enough.

If people didn't know, they would think you were her biological sister.

Su Yi is my younger sister.

Can't she be your sister-in-law?

180
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,430
Is there a story?

181

But, seriously speaking, how did you both...

182

Know each other?

Foolish girl.

189
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,400
Right. Why did you bring forward your return to China?

190
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,830
Jiashang told me to come back.

I have a lot to tell you.

If you didn't teach me make-up that year,

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,770
how could I look like this now?

199
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,270
Su Yi, you are becoming better.

I am just a witness to your growth.

202

- Older Sister Xia Tian, don't say that.
- Enough.

Last time, it was him who hired people to hit Li Jiashang, right?

In the end, the only punishment he received was getting fired.

217

At Lee Group, he was brazenly corrupt.

Seven years ago,

234
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,110
Li Mu Research Institute's researcher Mu Feng was in a car accident. You are the culprit behind this, right?

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm telling you that you have the wrong person. I am just a scapegoat.

236
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,500
That day, Chairman Li gave me a car,

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,710
and told me to rear-end and destroy it.

238
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,410
But when I received the car, it had already been destroyed.

239
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,580
Also, the car was always driven by CEO Li.

I thought he was in some sort of trouble and wanted to stay out of a lawsuit.

You need to look for Chairman Li or CEO Li. I'm begging you to please let me go.

I do have something I need you for. But you don't have to be so serious.

It means Li 'Jiashang' and Su 'Yi'.
