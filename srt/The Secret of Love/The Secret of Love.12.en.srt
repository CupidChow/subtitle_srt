[The Secret of Love]

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,390
[Episode 12]

14
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,040
Lee Group is indeed very prestigious.

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,860
So many renowned business founders have come to attend today's event.

16
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,580
- Hello Chairman Li.
- Hello Chairman Li.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,640
Su Yi wanted to come by herself.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,220
Your sister can take care of herself!

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,710
Have you come back to get married, Miss Luo? Have you already set the date?

20
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,570
If there is any good news, we will definitely tell you.

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,880
What are you doing? Don't you see Su Yi staring at us?

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
She already knows about it.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,760
Her knowing about it doesn't mean everyone knows about it.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,860
Today's my welcome party. Besides, Grandpa is here too.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,400
Show me some respect, will you?

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,600
I don't want to play along.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,450
You must.

28
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,660
Why isn't my sister here?

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,950
Can you stop staring at your sister, you freak?

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,960
Today, your Sister Xiyang will take you to see the world.

31
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,510
Do you know what's the most important part of a boy transitioning to manhood?

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,970
That is...

33
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,850
Right! Learn to drink alcohol!

34
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,170
Here! Drink it up.

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,640
This is yogurt. Where is the alcohol in this?

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,750
You silly. This is only yogurt.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,730
Do you know that alcohol is mainly absorbed through the lining of the small intestines?

38
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,220
If you drink this, it's like giving the intestine lining a coat of protection.

39
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,920
Add fructose to increase the metabolism of alcohol, and, lastly,

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,390
drink up this glass of Negroni.

41
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,670
In theory, it can help you maintain a slightly tipsy state the whole night.

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,980
Even more, you won't get drunk.

43
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,060
- Bottoms up?
- Bottoms up.

44
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,650
I can't stand this. I'm going to look for my sister.

45
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,170
Are you okay?

46
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,800
Yangyang.

47
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,220
How did you know that I like you wearing this kind of bling-bling outfit the most?

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm already immune to your pick-up lines.

49
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,430
Little Brother, can you help us take some pictures?
(T/N: The implied meaning of Little Brother is "handsome guy")

50
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
- Sure.
- Thank you.

51
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,920
Here.

52
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,990
Let's take another one.

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,590
Let's take another one. Good.

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,540
Thanks!

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,510
No problem.

56
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm good at taking CT scans at the hospital. Why did they ask you to take the photos for them?

57
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,610
Then just wait. I'll find them.

58
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,560
They asked the boyfriend of the Photography Master to take pictures for them without paying.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,340
Come back. Stop spouting nonsense here. You are not my boyfriend.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,670
But I have been working very hard these days.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,640
It seems that there really isn't any tipsiness.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,230
Fine. I'll let you have it.

63
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,480
It was originally mine.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,320
- Ms. Fan, long time no see.
- Hello.

65
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,810
The last time we met should've been...

66
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,250
Why is everyone watching Su Yi?

67
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,350
Do you know how to drink this glass of alcohol?

68
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,780
First, eat this.

69
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,940
Hand.

70
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,720
Give me your hand.

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,280
If you kiss like this,

72
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,960
it'll have a cherry flavor.

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,150
What are you doing over here?

74
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,620
Why is your face as red as a monkey's butt?

75
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,330
But, with my method, you shouldn't be.

76
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,660
Forget it. You should drink yogurt instead.

77
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't move.

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,180
I can still drink.

79
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,450
Not bad.

80
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,400
Heavens,

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,880
I accidentally trained a wine god.

82
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,930
Come back.

83
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,070
Tonight you should, obediently, stay at my side and not go anywhere.

84
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,460
Isn't it really sour?

85
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,280
Whiskey sour is, of course, sour.

86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,530
I even feel sympathy for you.

87
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,640
No need.

88
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,630
Stop faking bravery.

89
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,390
Meeting an opponent like Luo Manni, what can we do?

90
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,370
We? You and I are different.

91
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,070
Okay, let's wait until CEO Li and Manager Luo get engaged—

92
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,970
Don't mention things that will never happen.

93
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,820
Miss Su.

94
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,040
Chairman Gao.

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,190
Miss Su, did you drop something?

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,430
This... isn't mine.

97
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,490
Then, I should ask other people.

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,750
Why did I react so much to that photo?

99
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,980
The topic they gave me for my speech is

100
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,970
"the analysis and forecast of the economic scale of the beauty industry".

101
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,670
The speech manuscript has already been prepared,

102
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,040
but I'm getting old. I can't predict the future.

103
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,680
Let me leave it to the young people.

104
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,290
However, there are two things

105
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,200
- I'm going to announce today.
- Grandpa is giving his speech. Listen well.

106
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,810
First, I will completely step back.

107
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,360
My position as the chairman will be fully given to

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,240
the current CEO, Li Jiashang.

109
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,430
Jiashang, don't disappoint me.

110
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,680
Come. Come up and tell everyone.

111
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,690
Li Jiashang will be the new chairman of the company.

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,610
The second thing is in fact my wish.

113
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,160
If I can fulfill this wish before my retirement, then I'll be at ease.

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,790
Everyone knows that Luo Manni, Manager Luo,

115
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,520
has joined Lee Group today.

116
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,950
She's actually Jiashang's childhood sweetheart.

117
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,320
Moreover, the Li and Luo families are close.

118
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,440
Come up, Manni.

119
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,380
Today,

120
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,670
I'm going to announce

121
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,910
that Li Jiashang and Luo Manni will pick a date to get married.

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,270
The story of the Prince and Cinderella really only happens in fairytales.

123
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,830
I heard that CEO Li already prepared the engagement ring three months ago.

124
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,970
Hey!

125
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,460
Chairman Li, are you okay?

126
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,460
Su Yi!

127
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,920
You are not worth it for my sister!

128
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,390
Calm down!

129
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,720
It's raining, go find Su Yi.

130
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,020
- I'll go get the car. Watch over him.
- Okay.

131
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,870
Stop chasing people that you'll never be able to be with.

132
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,250
What does that mean?

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
She's also saying it to herself.

134
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,820
♫  So I hope for you to look at me  ♫

135
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,620
Luo Manni.

136
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,150
Manni actually is—

137
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,250
Don't explain. I only believe in what I see.

138
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,700
- Come back.
- Meeting an opponent like Luo Manni,

139
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,300
what can we do? Let's wait until CEO Li and Manager Luo get engaged—

140
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,780
Don't mention things,

141
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,150
Li Jiashang and Luo Manni,

142
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,530
that will never happen.

143
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,760
will pick a date to get married.

144
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:00,940
♫ I can't see through, I can't let go♫

145
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,450
♫ I can only be controlled silently by the emotions.♫

146
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,050
♫ I love you more than he does ♫

147
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:19,250
♫ I can only miss the sweet dream of you ♫

148
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,170
♫ I wish you a good life ♫

149
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,750
- Get in the car!
- Open the door!

150
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,530
♫ I won't reveal it  ♫

151
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:37,470
♫ I won’t be sad ♫

152
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,330
♫ if I don’t lose it ♫

153
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,070
Don't leave.

154
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,770
I won't.

155
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm getting you some medicine.

156
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,670
Let's go to the hospital.

157
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,670
Don't go.

158
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,200
Cold.

159
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,020
Jiashang.

160
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,580
Jiashang.

161
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,450
Jiashang.

162
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,530
Tell me the truth.

163
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,850
Is there anything

164
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,230
that you're hiding from me?

165
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,730
Rest first. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

166
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,150
Have you figured out that...

167
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,520
I am Mu Xiao?

168
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,870
Can you tell me

169
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,320
what happened between you and her?

170
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,790
Because I can't remember anything.

171
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,920
It's not like you don't have the passcode, Bro.

172
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,540
Bro, do you see a third hand that can open the door for me?

173
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Still laughing. Help me take it.

174
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,310
Do you know how many places I had to go to find this silkie chicken?

175
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,690
- I don't even treat girls this well.
- Okay, okay, you've worked hard.

176
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,450
Hey. What are you doing? I'll bring this in for you—

177
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,560
Don't! It's not convenient today.

178
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,080
How can it be inconvenient? Are you cooking chicken soup for her?

179
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,070
Let me tell you, it's not suitable for men to drink silkie chicken soup.

180
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,740
It's getting late. You should head home and get some rest.

181
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,450
Are you really going to kick someone out after taking benefits from him?

182
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,320
Life is cruel. Good night.

183
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,730
I'm done for. This isn't a dream?

184
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,680
Milk, you're awake. Good morning.

185
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,520
Why are you awake? Why don't you sleep more?

186
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,150
Why did you make so much?

187
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,010
Why does it feel like your temperature is lower than mine?

188
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,730
You didn't sleep?

189
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,820
I slept on the couch last night.

190
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,590
I removed your clothes... by putting the blanket over you.

191
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,200
I didn't even ask you that.

192
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,270
Where are my clothes?

193
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,990
I took them to dry clean.

194
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,790
That's enough. Don't pour more, I can't finish it.

195
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,650
No. You have to finish all of it.

196
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,770
Why are you looking at me? Why aren't you drinking?

197
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,080
I already drank it.

198
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,230
Did you put poison in the soup?

199
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,350
You must definitely be better since you have the energy to argue with me too.

200
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,180
What are you up to now?

201
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,740
Just keep eating. Don't mind me.

[Lee Group's New Product Marketing Campaign Meeting, 9 am]

203
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,620
I need to go.

204
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,070
I need to go to a meeting!

205
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,040
No rush. Finish it.

[Lee Group]

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Why is Director Su still not here?

208
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Don't you know what happened last night?

209
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Last night?

210
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,200
CEO Li also isn't here.

211
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,180
How much longer do we have to wait?

212
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,100
It's like this. Why don't we look at Ming Xiu's proposal first?

213
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
If I was going to look at that,

214
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,800
would I need to come here? In the next five minutes,

215
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
if they're still not here,

216
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,200
forget about the proposal.

217
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
What's going on? Did they escape at the last minute?

218
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know.

219
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Sorry.

220
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,800
Everyone has waited long.

221
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Now that everyone is here,

222
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
we'll start now.

223
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Director Su.

224
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,800
Please start.

225
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,100
Hello everyone, I am here to represent Ming Xiu,

226
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,300
to introduce the New Products Marketing Proposal.

227
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,200
The main feature of Lee Group's new products is...
[New Products Marketing Proposal]

228
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,400
[Is appearance righteous?]

229
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,510
repair.

230
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,400
The concealing proposal for the new products is very good,

231
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,100
- but I insist that the main focus should be on repair.
- Why?

232
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,600
The men sitting here probably don't understand,

233
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,000
but, as women, many don't dare to go out without putting on makeup.

234
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
They even become slaves to cosmetics,

235
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,600
and even need microdermabrasion and a beauty filter to take photos.

236
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,400
It's so flawless that one can't even spot the pores.

237
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,000
Because the outside world has too many voices, telling women that they're not good enough.

238
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
But what Lee Group's new products want to convey is,

239
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,200
compared to covering up flaws and relying on appearance,

240
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,600
real beauty comes only by true acceptance and change.

241
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Women

242
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
have been bound by this kind of stereotyping

243
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
definition of beauty for a long time.

244
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,000
So, our theme this time is

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
"beauty cannot be defined".

246
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,200
Everyone's shining moments should be seen.

247
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,200
We encourage youngsters to reveal their most beautiful moments,

248
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,000
and their most sparkling time.

249
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
To all youngsters?

250
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes.

251
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Women shouldn't be bound by their own appearance.

252
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,600
Men shouldn't conceal their desire for appearance too.

253
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,530
[Reveal your most beautiful moment]

254
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,200
I believe Lee Group's new products will be able to create

255
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
a bright and positive brand image.

256
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
Thank you, everyone.

257
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Okay, everyone can ask questions now.

258
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Regarding your proposal,

259
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
don't you think it'll offend

260
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,400
women who enjoy putting on makeup?

261
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
It's not encouraging women to not put on makeup,

262
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
but to encourage them to not be bound by it.

263
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,100
They have their own choices and should please only themselves.

264
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,400
Our Lee Group has a lot of makeup brands.

265
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,800
Wouldn't this be harming ourselves?

266
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,400
The new product's positioning is accurate and approachable.

267
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,600
There's also no conflict when compared to the previous high-end products.

268
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,900
Our main focus is the repair lotion, it's not a miracle treatment.

269
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,500
Is your proposal mocking those who don't have nice skin?

270
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,390
Hence, the focus of our marketing is not efficacy,

271
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,600
but helping people who have flaws on their face, to gain confidence again.

272
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,100
You don't sell products based on efficacy but emotions.

273
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,800
What's the difference between selling quack remedies and this?

274
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Do you doubt the efficacy of Lee Group's products?

275
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,200
In what way did you hear I was meaning that?

276
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Enough.

277
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,800
If there aren't any more questions, we can vote.

278
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
I don't like it.

279
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,000
Please vote anonymously. There is no need to express your personal opinion.

280
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
The results are out.

281
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,600
The total number of votes should be an odd number. Why is it even?

282
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,800
Is there anyone who hasn't voted?

283
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
Me.

284
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,900
Manager Luo, vote.

285
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,470
I...

286
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,200
We tried our best, how come she has the final vote?

287
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,150
support it.

288
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,700
Congratulations, Director Su.

289
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,380
Director Su, congratulations.

290
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Thank you, Manager Luo.

291
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,000
Why are you thanking me?

292
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
I'm merely helping the Lee Group weigh the pros and cons.

293
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,800
What about Murakami Kei?

294
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,500
You knew about his misconduct. That's why you deliberately canceled the appointment.

295
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
No.

296
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,900
I'm making trouble on purpose.

297
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Even if you aren't willing to admit it,

298
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,000
I still want to thank you.

299
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Okay, stinky younger brother.

300
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,100
I can only help you till this point.

301
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I really can't figure out Luo Manni.

302
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not important. You won anyways.

303
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
If you don't need anything, I'll get going.

304
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
You care about me, right?

305
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,600
- Let go of my hand.
- I won't.

306
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,800
It's you who didn't want me to let go.

307
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,100
When did I say that?

308
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
You said it last night.

309
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400
You said it the entire night, telling me to not let go.

310
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
If you don't remember it, then I can repeat it for you.

311
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,900
- You were saying—
- Stop joking around.

312
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,000
Have you figured out that I'm Mu Xiao?

313
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Can you tell me

314
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
what happened between you and her?

315
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
Because I can't remember anything.

316
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,310
I already know.

317
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,400
I know why you treated me like a stranger.

318
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,800
I know why you didn't believe me.

319
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,200
I know how long you were plagued by nightmares.

320
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
I also know

321
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,000
that you wanted so badly to tell me that you're Mu Xiao.

322
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,100
Because I've liked you since I was young,

323
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,200
I've been single until now.

324
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,790
I argued with Grandpa for you,

325
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,580
but now,

326
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,400
step by step, I walk towards you.

327
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
The only thing I want is, to be with you properly.

328
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,000
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

329
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You can trust me.

330
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,300
You can choose again.

331
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,600
I'll show you,

332
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,800
that in this world,

333
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,300
there is still someone you can rely on,

334
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,820
and a love that is worth waiting for a lifetime.

335
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

336
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,700
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

337
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,200
♫ On the travelling train ♫

338
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,400
♫ You first get off ♫

339
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,700
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫

340
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,000
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

341
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫

342
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,600
♫ It's still moving forward ♫

343
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,600
♫ Being side by side each other and looking
the gentle shoulders ♫

344
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,600
♫ Not all contacts are lost ♫

345
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:53,300
♫ Coincidentally, all insincere ♫

346
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:59,000
♫ We can be each other’s audience ♫

347
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,200
♫ The hug at the end, only start with no end ♫

348
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:13,600
♫ My tightly held stubbornness, feelings are all gone ♫

349
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,700
♫ Your unintentional words make my roar ♫

350
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,800
♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

351
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:34,000
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

352
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,900
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

353
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,500
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

354
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,700
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

355
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,000
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

356
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

357
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,500
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

358
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

359
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,400
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

360
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,200
♫ On the traveling train ♫

361
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,300
♫ You first get off ♫

362
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:28,000
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me ♫
