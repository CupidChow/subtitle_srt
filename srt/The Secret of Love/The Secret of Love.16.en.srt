[Inpatient]

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,450
The Chairman has had a momentary increase in blood pressure.

18
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,300
However, he needs to be under observation for two to three days.

19
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,600
My apologies. It's not convenient for him to see you now.

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,180
Jishang,

21
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,320
are we the cause?

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,690
We are not. Stop overthinking.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,100
I will stay here to keep Grandpa company. Why don't you go back now?

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,250
It's fine. I want to be with you.

25
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,460
Okay. Wait for me, I'm going to buy some stuff.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,660
Shocking news. Scarface nemesis Su Yi is the victim.

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,630
For the sake of the overbearing CEO, she shouldered everything.

28
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,500
Today is another day to shed tears for love.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,760
The person who spread this rumor must be jealous, right?

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,090
With a distorted mind.

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,470
How exaggerated.

w-what did you say?

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,270
Miss Su, sorry.

36
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,640
I recognized the wrong person.

37
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,960
Su Yi, welcome to Lee Group.

38
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,030
Ever since I switched off the Love Rival filter against you,

39
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,470
I'm beginning to find you more likable.

40
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,720
- Sister Manni—
- Don't.

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,220
Please don't call me that.

42
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,460
I will be your younger brother's wife in the future.

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,910
Fine.

44
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,290
Do you know the face is full of collagen?

45
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,640
So smooth and elastic.

46
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,620
- Manager Su, Manager Luo. There's something urgent!
- Slow down and speak.

47
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,070
The lead cast, Gu Sha, whom we booked for the commercial, wants to break her contract.

48
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,420
What?

49
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,100
Aren't we supposed to sign the contract soon?

50
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,570
It's fine. I will go.

51
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,400
I had several dealings with her agent.

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,580
Director Zhou, please review the contract again,

53
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,440
and check if there are any problems.

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,750
My apologies. We really don't have a schedule for this for these days.

55
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,470
I think Lin Zi Group must have grabbed your schedule, right?

56
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,970
Lin Zi Group is offering three times more than your company.

57
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,520
Our company has to consider the problem of realization too.

58
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,250
Realization can be a gain or loss.

59
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,430
Lin Zhi has always worked on a one-time collaboration,

60
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,880
they always change their ambassadors based on their popularity.

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,110
However, if you collaborate with Lee Group, we can improve Teacher Gu Sha's reputation and value.

62
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,690
It will allow you to have more choices for future business.

63
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,430
Moreover, your company doesn't only have one artist, right?

64
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,100
Lee Group has many high end products.

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,350
Then... let's reconsider this.

66
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,900
I believe that your choice

67
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,240
will be the same as ours.

68
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,710
Hello, Chairman Gao. I'm Gu Sha's agent.

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,110
We have adjusted the schedule for Lin Zhi's commercial.

70
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,920
You are here.

71
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,590
Take a seat and let's meditate together.

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,110
Breathe in.

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Breathe out.

74
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,250
- About that, we—
- Breathe in!

75
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,510
The posture

76
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,950
must be flexible.

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,680
Keep the balance

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,190
and keep exercising.

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,400
Chairman Gao.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,650
Can we talk about what we last discussed?

81
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,750
- Fine.
- Next time,

82
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,460
why don't we sing and chat?

83
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,250
I prefer singing.

84
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,660
When you have the time, you must exercise more.

85
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,190
Alright. I will.

I bumped into Uncle two days ago at the hospital.

89
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,140
Uncle? Does he deserve it?

90
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,190
No matter what, he's still a member of Lee family.

91

I have been overseas.

92
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,860
Regarding the relationship between you and your uncle...

93
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,950
I know why Grandpa wants me to stop launching the new products.

94
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,460
He wants to leave some market share to Lin Zhi Group.

- Older Sister.

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,820
Sorry. I recognized the wrong person.

101
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,750
I have been looking for you the whole day.

102
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,420
Thanks.

103

You are here staring out into the distance.

104
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,070
Still angry?

105
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,450
In your eyes, am I such a petty person?

106
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,430
Enough.

107
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,460
I have a welcome gift for you on joining Lee Group.

108
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,970
Flowers again? They're really not practical.

109
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,940
I will even need to see them wither.

110
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,130
CEO Li bought a new toy again?

111
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,410
For you.

112
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,530
It's such an expensive gift. I won't accept.

113
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,870
It's the company's asset on loan for your usage.

114
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,460
Don't tell me you don't have a driving license.

115
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,720
Of course, I do.

116
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,530
You have a driver's license but you can't drive.

117
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,340
I was a racer at Waseda. Just wait and see.

118
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,150
This is not Japan.

119
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,460
There are flat shoes in the car. Don't forget to change into them.

120
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,470
Don't be nervous.

121
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,040
Turn right ahead. There's less traffic there.

122

Jiashang, help me to check if there are any cars on the right?

123
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,980
Switch on your right turn signal.

Have you been overheated again lately?

131
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm going to check the car.

132
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,230
It's okay, as long as no one is hurt.

(T/N: Chinese Valentine's Day)

135
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,070
What about the day of Qixi Festival?

136
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,450
I only want to celebrate it with you at home.

137

Isn't this too easy for you?

- Hence, I prepared another gift for you.
- What is it?

139
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,620
I asked Zheng He to investigate the investment projects between Lee Group and Li Mu Research Institute,

140
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,420
and the investment accounts.

141
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,710
Isn't this your motive for coming back to China? To investigate if your father was corrupt.

142
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,650
If he was framed, that person who framed him

143
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,370
must have left some clues in the accounts.

144

Don't worry. I will definitely help you.

Yangyang, I'm working late.

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,460
Li Jiashang is becoming suspicious.

148
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,240
So fierce. I don't need to think about the short marketing video for Qixi Festival.

149
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,360
I was here to look for Xiangtai to play video games with him,

150
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,100
but was caught by you to work late with you.

151

[Zheng He : One must have a good mood to work late but I'm starving.]

153
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:17,450
Yiyi, after you remarkably removed your make-up, did you meet anyone suspicious?

154
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,880
The only suspicious person now is Gao Mu.

155
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,070
Uncle Zhang and Chu Mo are merely sounding alarms for me.

156
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,160
Gao Mu? That guy who scared you with the pendant at the cocktail party.

157
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,820
- Lin Zi's boss?
- Yes.

158

After the press conference, at the hospital,

159

he even called me Mu Xiao in front of me.

160
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,470
This is strange. Could it be your old acquaintance again?

Do you want to probe him and find out what's going on?

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,200
Because I was thinking,

165
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,450
how could there possibly be two people who look exactly the same in this world?

166
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm already aware of your motive for coming back to China.

167
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,920
- Hence, I advise you—
- No need to advise me.

168

In fact, you know that I'm Li Jiashang's uncle,

169
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,450
but my family name is not Li. It's because I'm an illegitimate child.

170
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,620
I used to be the person in charge of Li Mu Research Institute.

171
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,360
However, the Li family has always refused to acknowledge me.

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,130
This Li family is rather scary.

173

You and your father are not the only victims.

174

I remember that you showed me a pendant at the cocktail party.

175

I randomly picked that up.

176

I don't know where I lost it later.

177

Thinking about that time, it was really beautiful.

178
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,200
Your parents and I were very good friends.

179
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,390
I remember your parents brought you along when you were this tall

180
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,190
when we got together. Of course,

181
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,790
you were very young then and don't remember me.

182

183

After the car accident, I lost my memories.

184

Gao... Uncle Gao, how did you know I was still alive?

185
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,310
About this, I can tell you

186
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,030
but you must swear that you won't tell the Li family.

187
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,300
Because I don't want to cause any trouble.

188
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,610
I give you my word.

189
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,910
In fact, at that time, I was suspicious

190
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,300
that Zheng Yi's autopsy report was faked.

191
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,580
I installed a camera at Zheng Yi's office.

Don't blame me for such a dirty trick.

When one is old, he becomes more cowardly

With your sister's taste, she wouldn't buy anything inexpensive.
