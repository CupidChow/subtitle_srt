But we cannot retreat. We have to face the difficulties.

165
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,860
- Because we—
- Have nothing to do.

166
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,890
I...

167
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,490
It is better if we think of a plan.

168
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,590
I feel bad seeing my sister now as if nothing has happened.

169
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,850
But the choice is still in your sister's hands.

170
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,580
Right. It is useless for us to persuade Su Yi, but we can find someone they both know.

171
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,840
Find a senior whom they both know.

172
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,000
Chairman Li.

173
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,430
- Uncle Zhang!
- Uncle Zhang!
- Uncle Zhang!

174
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,230
[Rui Mu Pet Clinic]

175
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,830
I have eaten already. Hurry up and have a taste.

176
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,260
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

177
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,080
Starting early this morning, I've stewed this beef brisket the whole morning.

178
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,340
The vermicelli noodles in here, I also bought from an old shop.

179
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,830
After I bought it, I couldn't finish it alone.

180
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,600
If I had a partner, that would be good.

181
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,810
But really,

182
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,960
Uncle Zhang, it has been so many years. Why haven't you gotten married?

183
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,790
I have something I want to give my whole life's worth to.

184
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,030
The Pet Clinic really is your interest.

185
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,230
Don't keep talking about me. Hurry up and eat it while it's still hot.

186
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,190
This is my best skill.

187
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,940
Try this soup first. Jiashang likes it a lot.

188
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,290
Uncle Zhang.

189
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,200
Can we not mention him in the future?

190
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,000
If I don't mention him, you're not going to miss him?

191
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,530
Child, I know

192
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,030
you are doing this all for your parents.

193
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:32,340
It is also for him. But do you know what your parents want?

194
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,130
What Jiashang wants?

195
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,020
Why do you have to choose for them?

196
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,790
Also for yourself,

197
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,760
you feel bad when you are together with him, but don't feel bad when you separate from him?

198
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,130
It is so delicious.

199
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,640
Eat slowly. I will pour a glass of water for you.

200
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,480
You finally came.

201
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,780
Count how many bottles I drank while waiting for you. Count it!

202
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,010
I'm sorry. I forgot.

203
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,140
Forgot? You seriously asked to see me, how can you forget?

204
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,690
Did you just break up?

205
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,990
Listen to this.

206
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,330
Brother Mu, you have to hurry up and leave this place.

207
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,680
There's someone after me.

208
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,590
If something happens to me, it must be Li—

209
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,810
No way, no way. I met the policeman that handled this case.

210
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,630
In his report, Mu Feng's phone was not found near him.

211
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,260
It was found in Li Mu Research Institute.

212
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,930
Then do the contents on the phone match up?

213
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,460
It was completely destroyed. It was impossible to unlock.

214
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,980
There are two possibilities. One,

215
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,120
my dad did not have his phone with him when he met had the accident. The recording that Gao Mu gave me is fake.

216
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,930
But Uncle Zhang told me the voice in the recording is indeed my father's,

217
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,390
and there's the sound of the car crashing.

218
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,740
Two, the recording is real. This means that

219
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,810
someone took my dad's phone from the scene of the accident.

220
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,040
Then according to your second hypothesis,

221
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,770
who would take away the phone?

222
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,830
I will ask Chu Mo tomorrow.

223
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,870
Sister Su Yi, you're back.

224
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,330
- Sister Su Yi's gifts for you guys.
- Sister Su Yi, you're here!

225
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,180
- Come sit here.
- These are from Sister Su Yi. Come.

226
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,620
- Sister Su Yi, I miss you so much.
- You're so lovable.

227
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,880
Thank you, Sister Su Yi.

228
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,150
Sister Su Yi, look how happy everyone is when you're back.

229
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,930
This is...

230
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,220
My friend. He came to see President Chu with me.

231
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,470
- Hello, my name is Ding Hang.
- I am Chen Jing.

232
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,000
I am Su Yi.

233
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,500
President Chu is in a meeting right now. It should end soon. Let me take a look.

234
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,060
Who is she?

235
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,190
Why?

236
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,130
Nothing.

237
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,300
Long time no see.

238
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,220
- President Chu.
- This person looks familiar.

239
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,020
President Chu, your memory is so good. I used to work at Ming Xiu as well.

240
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,470
Not important.

241
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,600
Take a seat.

242
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,330
President Chu, I think someone may have taken my father's phone from the scene.

243
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,230
It's okay, he's with us.

244
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,600
I really don't know anything about the phone, since I didn't have access to key evidence.

245
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,010
Then did you find anything odd at the scene?

246
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,180
I did not continue investigating because

247
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,290
there was debris from another car at the scene.

248
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,670
And it turned out that the owner of the car was Chairman Li.

249
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,960
Indeed, someone was after my dad's car. The recording is real as well.

250
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,260
Then someone must have taken away the phone.

251
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,220
Definitely, because they wanted to destroy the evidence.

252
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,690
Oh right, I have something at five o'clock.

253
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,730
I'll leave first.

254
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,190
- I'm returning to the company.
- I am as well.

255
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,930
Then why didn't you drive?

256
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,890
I want to exercise today.

257
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,850
Later, I need to start a meeting regarding the advertising numbers of the new products.

258
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,190
I have something to say.

259
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,860
Right.

260
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,830
This advertisement will be filmed on an island.

261
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,800
The female lead is Li Xiatian. The male lead is Su Xiangtai.

262
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:27,510
I have something else to announce. Su Yi will retire from her vice president position.

263
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,660
She will be the acting manager for the filming of the advertisement.

264
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,670
Tonight, she will leave with the filming crew.

265
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,270
If there's nothing else, the meeting is over.

266
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,650
What? What are you doing?

267
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,830
I'm sorry CEO Li. I refuse to travel elsewhere, as I still have things to do.

268
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,360
- This has already been decided.
- Then I resign.

269
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,190
The resignation must be notified thirty days prior.

270
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,160
Why would you give her such a tedious job?

271
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,470
It's all because of Grandpa.

272
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,120
Seems like Grandpa knows something. I can't be by her side every day,

273
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,270
so I have to demote her so she can be elsewhere for a few days.

274
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,060
If she's with you guys, I won't have to worry as much.

275
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,360
You're awake? Let me tell you,

276
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,410
my favorite author is having a press conference for his new book today.

277
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,560
If Su Yi was here, you wouldn't have this honor.

278
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,090
What's the book about?

279
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,600
It's a story about a mother and her son.

280
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,140
Apparently, it's very touching.

281
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,650
So nice. I miss my mom as well.

282
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,540
Your mom has written a book too, right?

283
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,080
Didn't she leave you a souvenir?

284
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,800
How did you know that my mom has written a book?

285
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,680
I... saw it in a bookstore.

286
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,950
My mom died before her book could be published.

287
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,450
The manuscript is only in my dad's safe.

288
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,240
How did you know about it?

289
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,850
Zheng He, don't be like this.

290
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,240
Tell me the truth.

291
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,280
Su Yi and Gao Mu's meeting was a misunderstanding.

292
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,820
Please, don't make people follow her anymore.

293
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,050
Our family has done her a lot of wrongs.

294
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,420
Hello, what should I do? Zheng He already knows

295
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,560
that Su Yi suspected Zheng Yi. I can't reach Su Yi right now.

296
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,930
- Hello?
- Wait, where are you going?

297
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,070
Book me a ticket to the filming location.
