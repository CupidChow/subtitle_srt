[The Secret Of Love]

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,330
[Episode 25]

14
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,040
Why do you never knock on the door before you come in? Su Yi would knock.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,640
Would I be the same as Su Yi?

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,800
You can let me be the CEO's assistant, but I have a condition.

17
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,130
What condition?

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,380
I want the team building. Two days and one night.

19
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,150
It'll be at the hot spring resort forty minutes away from here. I will determine who gets to go.

20
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,250
Do whatever you want.

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,540
Come in.

22
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,530
The public's opinion regarding the formula has subsided. Sales have increased and the price of shares came back up too.

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,790
We should really relax now.

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,450
If Zheng He goes, I won't go.

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,060
You really care about him that much?

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,260
I heard this fountain pen was a gift from Zheng He,

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,890
when you got your first order.

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,630
- Are you calling this "don't care"?
- That's right.

29
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,080
Just go, Jiashang.

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,830
I will go.

31
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,770
What are you doing?

32
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,100
It'll be worse if you delete it.

33
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,580
Manni said we will go for the team building this weekend, just a few of us.

34
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,200
Come join us.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,490
I'm not in the mood.

36
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,820
Even Jiashang said he's going.

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,170
Do you think Zheng He would go too?

38
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,270
Who cares about him? Doesn't matter if he goes or not.

39
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,650
Yangyang, there's no need for you and Zheng He to have a stalemate.

40
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,840
He's him and we are us. Two completely different matters.

41
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,270
Su Yi, are you kidding me?

42
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,960
I will teach you a way

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,260
to not lose your pride and make him go too.

44
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,970
Here.

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,540
You, too.

46
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,130
Manni, aren't you cold? Put this on.

47
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,240
- I'm not cold. Are you cold?
- I'm not.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,800
Where's Li Jiashang?

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,100
Let's take photos. I have no idea where he is.

50
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,330
- Come here, quick.
- Hurry up.

51
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,660
Three, two, one.

52
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,150
I'm done. Pass me the gun.

53
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,220
- Let's go over there.
- Wait for me.

54
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,730
- Stop shooting at my body.
- Stop dodging.

55
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,170
Go dodge, dodge.

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,100
Xiangtai, stop aiming at me.

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,970
You are too much.
[Accident]

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,420
Su Xiangtai.

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,130
I see a ghost when it's dark.

60
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,000
It's better to see a ghost than Su Xiangtai.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,330
Are you gifting this to Luo Manni?

62
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,770
None of your business.

63
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,490
When I see it next time, it'll probably be in the trash bin.

64
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm not even giving this to you. Stop finding faults.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,770
I'm just giving you good advice.

66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,310
I'm afraid you will go in smiling and cry when you are out.

67
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,220
Luo Manni won't fall for this trick.

68
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,390
Do you live by the sea? Your intervention is so wide.
(T/N: meaning he meddles too much)

69
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,150
Whatever.

70
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,360
My baby is back. What did you do? What took you so long?

71
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,950
Wait. Who made you angry? Why are you unhappy?

72
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,370
I went to buy you a gift.

73
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,640
What gift?

74
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,740
But first promise me that you will like it.

75
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,150
You give me a gift, of course, I'll like it!

76
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,600
You must cherish it.

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,410
You first let me see.

78
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,950
Promise me first.

79
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,710
- Let me take a look first—
- Promise me first.

80
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,020
Let me take a look!

81
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,310
What a cute whale! Where did you buy this from?

82
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,020
You said you'll cherish it.

83
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,730
I will cherish it. How could I not, when it's a gift from you?

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,230
This is my first gift to you.

85
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,260
Then let's give it a name.

86
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,820
Let's call it Milk Dog.

87
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,630
What Milk Dog?

88
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,090
This is a small whale.

89
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,010
Xia Xiyang, what are you up to?

90
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,830
Next time when I'm not around, are you going to risk your life?

91
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,710
Take a seat.

92
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,200
I miss you.

93
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,110
Don't do this again.

94
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,690
You didn't contact me all these days. Didn't you miss me at all?

95
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,370
Didn't I give you a thumbs up?

96
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,010
Something is still missing.

97
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,910
Such an unpleasant odor. Let's go take a bath at the hot spring.

98
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,640
- Together?
- Let's go.

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,630
Let me do a facial mask first. You go over first.

100
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,150
Make it quick.

101
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,860
Go now. Go!

102
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,430
He isn't there, right?

103
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,420
Of course not! Just us.

104
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,370
Go now.

105
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,140
Not even a little bit hot.

106
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,050
Childish.

107
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,970
I'm happy with this.

108
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,770
Indeed, it isn't hot enough.

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,870
Let's see who isn't childish and can stand the heat.

110
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,820
Seriously.

111
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,200
They are coming out. Quick.

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,870
[Be gentle with the glass door]

113
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,060
Who are you calling this late?

114
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,890
Why did you come back so soon? I haven't even gone there yet.

115
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,620
You are pretending.

116
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,890
Without you packing, I couldn't find the facial mask.

117
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,500
Continue your act!

118
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,660
You are pretending, too.

119
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,380
What did I do?

120
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,720
Who were you calling behind my back?

121
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,130
A woman.

122
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,240
Especially beautiful and gentle.

123
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,260
A woman.

124
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,090
I'm not going to reconcile with you.

125
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,680
Go and sleep alone.

126
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,010
Where are you going?

127
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,580
Zheng He, you are a scoundrel and rotten thug!

128
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,660
I'm a man.

129
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,980
Zheng He, you are a scoundrel!

130
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,180
Stop taking off your clothes!

131
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,010
Why are you sitting here alone?

132
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,810
You are with me.

133
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,160
Why do you keep thinking about my buddy?

134
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,540
Is this appropriate?

135
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,840
Ignoring me? Fine.

136
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,110
Ignoring me, right?

137
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,460
Li Jiashang!

138
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,400
- Ignoring me?
- Li Jiashang, put me down.

139
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,450
Li Jiashang!

140
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,680
Let me tell you!

141
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,280
In this life, I won't let you go.

142
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,530
It's good that you know the consequences.

143
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,080
Where are you taking me, Li Jiashang?

144
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,940
- I'm taking you to play.
- Li Jiashang!

145
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,200
Based on the principles of fairness and justice,

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,070
this Counter-Strike competition is divided into two teams.

147
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,760
A male team and a female team.

148
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,770
Everyone, get your guns.

149
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,130
Victory! Victory! Victory!

150
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,220
Hurry up.

151
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,070
Good luck.

152
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,620
Good luck.

153
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,170
Su Yi.

154
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,610
Li Jiashang!

155
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,460
Please leave the site.

156
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,740
Scared me to death. So tiring.

157
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,590
I don't want to play anymore. Give me a massage.

158
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,530
Is there something wrong with your posture?

159
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,670
No idea.

160
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,490
The battle begins. Let's go.

161
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,190
I won.

162
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,740
I eliminated Su Yi.

163
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,410
- Are you crazy?
- I regret that

164
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,310
your life has been extinguished. Please, leave the site.

165
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,260
We are even now for what previously happened.

166
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,410
I regret that your life has been extinguished. Please, leave the site.

167
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,400
It would be great if the happy days were longer.

168
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,120
Look at how happy you are, especially after he came.

169
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,790
Definitely.

170
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,150
It would be great if the happy days were longer.

171
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,220
As long as you want it,

172
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,840
you will have it.

173
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,540
Sleep if you are tired.

174
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,280
Once I take over the hospital, I can consider collaborating with you.

175
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,640
But the bottom line is, don't touch Xia Xiyang.

176
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,860
What's up? It doesn't taste good?

177
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,090
[Yangyang: Can you pick me up? I have something to tell you.]

178
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,830
There are changes in Lin Zi's shares but the bank loans are still increasing.

179
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,880
I need to go back to the company for a meeting later.

180
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,210
I'm going to pick up Xiyang too. She didn't tell me any specifics. I will talk to you after picking her up.

181
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,320
Why are you looking at me? Stalking the wife?

182
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,030
Yiyi finally knows how to share things with me.

183
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,950
Your mood is not bad today.

184
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,530
What's wrong? Are you having your period?

185
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,900
No.

186
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,170
Or are you pregnant?

187
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,220
How did you know?

188
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,700
Why are you so careless?

189
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,740
Why didn't you protect yourself?

190
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,330
Didn't we talk about this?

191
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,870
Even if you are engaged, you should have taken precautions.

192
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,460
Does Zheng He know?

193
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,410
I don't plan on telling him for the time being.

194
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,870
What happened exactly?

195
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,880
Yangyang, these are two different matters.

196
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,480
Zheng He is the child's father. He has the right to know.

197
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,240
Move forward with your wedding.

198
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,180
I saw that Zheng He contacted Gao Mu.

199
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,350
Whose cellphone is this?

200
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,350
The guy who's with me.

201
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,960
[Gao Mu]

202
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,680
No matter what, you must tell Zheng He as soon as possible.

203
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,520
If you don't say it, I will.

204
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,660
Director, this is the weekly report from our surgical department.

205
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,550
Leave it there. It has been tough for you, Doctor Xia.

206
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,360
Not at all. Our director has the toughest job.

207
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,430
That's right too. Xiao Xia,

208
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,910
can you massage the shoulders for your director?

209
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,560
This... isn't appropriate.

210
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,530
How come it's not appropriate?

211
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,760
I won't eat you.

212
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,430
Okay, I better respect your order.

213
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,990
How is it? Is the pressure okay?

214
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,320
Good good! Very satisfying!

215
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,300
Doctor Xiao Xia is young and beautiful.

216
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,080
Do you want to be with me?

217
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,930
Not good.

218
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,290
Actually, I am already pregnant.

219
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,110
Then it's good.

220
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,480
Let's marry and get our certificate.

221
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,500
Do you really want to marry me?

222
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,150
Yes. We should be responsible for our children.

223
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,140
Then, do you really like children?

224
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,650
I swear that I will definitely treat him extremely well.

225
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,130
Then it's good.

226
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,060
Actually, I am really pregnant.

227
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,210
Let me see if you are having a fever.

228
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,750
Is he marrying me because of the child?

229
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,250
I was joking. You look so scared.

230
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,910
Yangyang, you shouldn't joke about this.

231
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,990
Where are we going after work?

232
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,110
Actually.... I....

233
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,860
I get it. I won't drive you there.

234
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,580
Didn't you reconcile with Li Jiashang?

235
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,750
Yangyang, things are not as simple as you think.

236
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,920
Jiashang.

237
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,510
Why did you drink so much?

238
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,080
So many things happened lately.

239
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,930
You are not allowed to drink so much in the future.

240
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,200
In the future, you are not allowed to settle scores after the fact.

241
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,370
You are not allowed to talk back in the future.

242
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,090
You are not allowed to talk imperatively to me in the future.

243
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,660
You are not allowed to drink so much in the future.

244
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,910
I will drink.

245
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,090
Are all beautiful women this unreasonable?

246
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,380
Fine. You can sleep with your reason then.

247
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,090
I believe it will please you more than I do.

248
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,660
Can't sleep?

249
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,590
Are you sober now?

250
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,960
You are not bad at retaliation.

251
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,760
Drive me home.

252
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,240
I can't sleep, and you can't sleep either.

253
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,420
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

254
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:31,560
♫ Since then become a hurry ♫
