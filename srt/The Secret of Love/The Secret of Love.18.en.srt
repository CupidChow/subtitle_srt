[Episode 18]

14
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,400
CEO Li, you cannot enter without an appointment!

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,800
CEO Li!

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,390
Chairman Gao!

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,900
You are showing up here uninvited. What brings you here?

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,400
I came to tell you,

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,300
don't do anything to the people around me.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,800
What do you mean by this?

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
Miss Su has her own legs,

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,700
how can I control where she goes?

23
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,990
What you say makes perfect sense.

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,400
But you should not forget one thing.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
What's the reason that your last name isn't Li?

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,800
You should not take a mile after I gave you an inch.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
During all of these years, I gave you all the low-end markets,

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
yet you are still fighting with Jiashang?

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,400
What are you fighting for? For my seat, after I die?

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,500
Don't forget! He belongs to our Li Family!

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Do you know what trust is?

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,800
You don't! Otherwise, you wouldn't have come looking for me!

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
Actually, we are both the same at the core.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
It must be so, since blood ties can't be changed.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,900
We both can't trust people easily,

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,600
but we ask others to trust us unconditionally.

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Distrust is our family trait.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tell me... are we pathetic or not?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
We are.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Chairman Gao, you tell me.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
If someone can't even trust his own son,

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,900
who is the one at fault then?

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,600
I didn't think you'd speak up for him.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,000
You should not forget how he treated you back then.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Our Jiashang is getting more and more powerful.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are no longer that kid

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
who was screaming and crying to find his girlfriend.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,800
When the corpse was transported and received,

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Jiashang was getting more interested in the research institute, so he wasn't there that day.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
When they left, I noticed that, in the document they gave me,

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,300
the page number had already been changed to 8.

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey! What are you thinking about by yourself?

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Is this how you treat your battle buddy?

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Is this how you betray your battle buddy?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,300
You didn't tell me we must hide from him.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
Besides that, you were displaying affection in such an obvious manner at the product launch event.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,600
I didn't know you wanted to keep him out.

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
I am not keeping him out.

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,200
I only want to find the right timing so I can tell him.

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Frankly speaking, you still don't trust them!

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Fine, fine!

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I will keep my mouth shut and won't comment on your relationship.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Give me a chance to make up for it!

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I found the company where Zheng Yi used to work as a medical examiner.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,900
I'll visit there later, to see why he quit and then changed his career.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
You are somehow useful.

67
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,500
In your eyes, do you think the only function of men is being used by you?

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Shouldn't people be happy at the value they create when being used?

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
Remember to pay the bill!

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,600
You have ordered so much!

71
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,300
I am back!

72
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,600
How was your day?

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,200
One whole day of recruitment presentations!

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,400
My brain is fried!

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,400
Why so many?

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Right, they forced all of these into my hand.

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
It's so tedious being number one in the class.

78
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Lee Group attended as well?

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Yes.

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
And Li Jiashang was there in person!

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Did he repeatedly emphasize

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,900
that they value the development of scientific researchers?

83
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
How did you know?

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,300
He even said that Lee Group started with cosmetics,

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,100
then moved on to skincare research. People were not confident in them at the time,

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,800
until the first generation of exceptional skincare technology was developed,

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
which suddenly made Lee Group a high-end skincare brand.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,000
That's why he wants to be the first to hire

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
the best candidates like you.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
He said that he will let me work at Lee Group Research Institute

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,800
and will pay for the break fee of my modeling contract.

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you want to go?

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,700
Just thinking of

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,400
working with him makes me uncomfortable all over.

95
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,160
This person looks so familiar.

[2001 Li Mu Research Institute Memorial Photograph]

97

Xiangtai, look.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,000
So similar.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Except that his head became balder and his eye bags became bigger.

Wu Linjiang, Lee Group Research Institute core researcher representative.

101
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,000
Sis, this person is in both the contacts and the group photo,

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
- so...
- So this means that he is like my father and Zhu Yue.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,200
From the establishment to the closing of Li Mu Research Institute, he was there the whole time.

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
This person has always been in Lee Group Research Institute,

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,500
which means that he must know a lot about Uncle Mu.

106
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,300
Looks like I need to find the time to visit Lee Group Research Institute.

107
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,600
Sis, I should go. I have to intern there anyway.

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,400
If you visited so suddenly, it would be suspicious.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
What are you doing?

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
Didn't someone just say that they felt uncomfortable all over?

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes, I am uncomfortable. I have to move to a dorm in order to intern.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,700
I don't want to make you live alone.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,100
Yangyang, is the surgery over?

114
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,400
I ordered food for you, did you receive it?

"You know what love is?"
(T/N: reference to a popular Chinese novel)

"It is when two people stick together in life and death."

118
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You want to die for love?

119
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,000
A'Shang, your humor is more catastrophic than when my Yangyang acts cute.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
If you're done eating then leave.

121
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,800
You two haven't made up yet?

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,300
Because you're in a drought yourself, you won't let me receive waves of love?

123
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,100
Think about it. If Xia Xiyang did something behind your back,

124
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,600
how would you feel?

125
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Whatever she does behind my back, she does it for your Su Yi.

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,700
I'd rather you die for love.

127
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,800
Okay,

128
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
you blame her for not being completely honest with you, and she blames you for asking someone to follow her.

129
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Both of you are like "the pot calling the kettle black".

130
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
My purpose is to protect her.

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,500
- She is also trying to protect you.
- Protect me?

132
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,100
You said it yourself. She hid those real and fake autopsies from you.

133
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Tell me, who do you think is behind that?

134
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't say you have never raised a doubt. If Su Yi really forces you to cut ties with your family,

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,700
can you say that you will not hesitate even a little?

136
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,000
In the beginning, I was suspecting only of his grandpa.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,800
But Gao Mu's words made me think that Li Jiashang isn't that simple either.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Then ask him directly if he had anything to do with the body donor.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm scared that he will directly admit it, but I'm also scared that he will lie and deny it.

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,300
I do kind of want to avoid that.

141
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,000
Then there could be one more possibility left.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,900
He really has nothing to do with it and Gao Mu is the one lying.

143
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,600
It might be.

144
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,920
Let's go!

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,400
But Yangyang, I was thinking...

146
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,600
If Gao Mu is really as innocent as he claims to be,

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
what could have he done to make his family desert him?

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,200
At the banquet, Chairman Li was acting as if he was a stranger to him.

149
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Li Jiashang as well! He was so hostile to him!

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Most probably this Gao Mu

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,100
is just another Vice President Zhang who came to disrupt things.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,200
But he did help me find the autopsy report from Zheng Yi.

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Maybe he did that on purpose to ingratiate himself with you.

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Look at who you've reached out to before,

155
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,300
Zhu Yue and Chu Mo. They both want to avoid talking about that incident.

156
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,200
Only Gao Mu seems enthusiastic about helping. Do you really think it's because he knew your parents?

157
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Yangyang, my brain is a mess right now.

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,400
I can't even trust my own memory.

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,100
Did you recall something?

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I always feel like

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,800
the last location in my memory is Li Mu Research Institute.

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
But Uncle Zhang told me that I'm wrong.

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
He said that my amnesia was caused by the car accident.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,100
I think you can trust your own memory.

165
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,000
Since, no matter if it's good or bad, it's what you have been searching for.

166
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
[Li Jiashang, Ding Hang]

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Yes, Yiyi.

168
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Aren't you sleeping yet? It's so late!

169
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,800
You had a nightmare again?

170
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Since you two had an argument, not even Plus One can protect you anymore.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,190
I suspect that I'm living in a magical world.

172
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,430
Maybe it's because Xiangtai also moved out today.

173
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,000
Why do you look like a beast in human clothing today?

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
Are you going to be an emcee?

175
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Don't move. I have something to tell you.

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
Then say it quickly.

177
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
I only have half an hour lunch break. I want to go back and take a nap.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,040
Ok, ok. It's quick.

179
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,000
I have something to give you.

180
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,600
Hey, did you do something wrong?

181
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,400
No, I just...

182
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,300
It's hot today.

183
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,400
Did something fall?

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,200
- What's that? Let me see.
- It's nothing.

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
Let me see.

186
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,000
Give it. Give it to me!

187
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,860
Quickly.

188
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:46,000
♫ You are my unique light. A different existence ♫

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Is there not even a box?

190
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,000
I know it's a little early, a little rushed.

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
But I'm not just acting on impulse.

192
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
I admit that I was initially interested in you due to your looks,

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,300
but falling in love with you is my revolt against my previously numb life.

194
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Zheng He and Xia Xiyang, a perfect match!

195
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,800
The first time I saw you, I imagined

196
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,400
what expression you would have when I propose to you,

197
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,700
and what we will name our first child.

198
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,000
Something that I'm so sure,

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,200
only happens once in a lifetime.

200
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Yangyang,

201
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,400
I want to be the one who always makes you happy.

202
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I am very very seriously asking you

203
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,160
to spend the rest of your life with me.

204
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,400
What expression do I have right now?

205
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,800
A "how did I succumb to this dumb man" expression.

206
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,600
Then shouldn't you kneel down?

207
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
On one knee. Who proposes when kneeling down on both knees?

208
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
Embarrassing.

209
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,400
- Oh right.
- Why are you still here?

210
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Remember to go home for dinner on Friday.

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Remember to bring my daughter-in-law.

212
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, my wife,

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
will you be attending the dinner on Friday?

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,100
Get up.

215
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
What's with you?

216
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
You rascal,

217
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,000
you haven't promised me yet. Think about how long you've not returned home for dinner.

218
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
Do you not know why I don't go back home?

219
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,200
If I hadn't seen you two today, were you planing on keeping this from me?

220
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,800
I don't have anything to keep from you. I have always planned on marrying her.

221
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm warning you. I'll overlook how you disobey my words,

222
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,000
but every human has to have affection and loyalty.

223
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,500
I don't need you to tell me, I will treat Yangyang like family,

224
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,700
and treat her well for the rest of my life.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
- Where are the people who were harassing you?
- I scared them away.

226
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
You're one step too late.

227
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
Nobody was harassing you, right?

228
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
There was.

229
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,100
You did come here.

230
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,500
Don't be mad, I really need your help.

231
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,800
When I was showering earlier, I ran out of hot water.

232
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Did you make me come here on purpose?

233
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,800
So clever, you saw right through my ruse.

234
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you too lazy to even lie to me right now?

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,900
Why would I lie to you? I just want to tell you that

236
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,000
every day that I don't see you at Lee Group, makes me upset.

237
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
I want to see you, so I want to see you right away.

238
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Are you, rich people, having too much time?

239
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Does torturing others make you happy? It's already so late, but I came here from the research institute,

240
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
thinking that you're really in danger.

241
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,100
20 kilometers of road, I only took twenty something minutes–

242
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,600
Why do you like me?

243
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,600
Don't think too much.

244
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Can't we follow our feelings?

245
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Call Manager Su in.

246
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Okay, CEO Li.

247
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,900
Come in.

248
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Why is Manager Luo here as well?

249
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,600
What? Do you not welcome me?

250
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Didn't CEO Li call me here to report my work?

251
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I just wanted to come with Manager Luo,

252
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,500
since many ideas were discussed among the two of us.

253
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,800
If you two want to talk about your relationship, I can leave first.

254
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
No need.

255
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,830
Go ahead and report.

256
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,200
These are two plans regarding the new storefront.

257
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,500
I personally lean towards A.

258
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,800
I choose B.

259
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
- But CEO Li–
- We will settle on B.

260
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Are you very happy recently?

261
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,630
Is it that obvious?

262
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
Last night,

263
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,200
I succeeded.

264
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,480
How dare you, to my brother–

265
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,400
Don't discuss private matters during work time.

266
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Recently, there are a few larger e-commerce platforms

267
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
that want us to spotlight our new products through livestreams.

268
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
We can think about that.

269
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Livestream discounts can increase sales,

270
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,400
but it's not beneficial for returning purchases in physical stores.

271
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Everything has pros and cons. You can't only consider the cons.

272
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,000
What if there are more cons than pros? There has to be a balance, right?

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,700
What do you think, Manager Luo?

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I think you two are very childish.

275
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,300
Can you two avoid bringing your private emotions to work?

276
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay. Manager Su, I have another mission for you.

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Attain the primary sponsor spot for this reality program.

278
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Reality program sponsorships are the epitome of high profile marketing,

279
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
which is what we have been trying hard to avoid.

280
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,800
- I think–
- Earlier, we only did small investments.

281
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Just to test out the waters. Now, sales continue to rise.

282
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,400
I think we are ready to do big-scale marketing.

283
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
Can I deny this mission? It does not fit with our new product's image.

284
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,500
You can.

285
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,600
I have assigned this to Manager Luo already. You are just my backup.

286
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
When did you assign it to me?

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
A couple of days ago.

288
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,790
Okay. Then I'll go first.

289
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Su Yi!

290
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,630
Milk hasn't been feeling so well lately. Come with me to the Pet Clinic.

291
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,290
[Rui Mu Pet Clinic]

292
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,530
How is it, doctor?

293
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,740
The situation is not very promising. Cats usually use their tongues to clean their fur.

294
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,340
But it's very difficult to eliminate the swollen particles from the fur through defecation or vomiting—

295
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,430
Is it feeling ill?

296
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,940
Yes. How about this? I will give it some pain killers later,

297
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,930
and you come take it back home tomorrow. Alright?

298
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,200
Doctor, please give it this.

299
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,420
Alright.

300
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
Thank you.

301
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,610
Jiashang.

302
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,370
Milk must be feeling very sick right now.

303
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,510
I am wondering... if I should make it less painful...

304
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,820
But haven't you previously said that as long as it lives,

305
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,600
there is still hope for improvement?

306
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,630
You also heard what the doctor just said. Milk is way too old.

307
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,460
I don't want it to suffer like that.

308
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,160
Let's wait a few more days!

309
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,580
I am being selfish,

310
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,240
I want to keep it by our side, to accompany us,

311
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,590
for however many days it will be able to stay with us.

312
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,960
I've thought about the sponsorship.

313
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,420
Earlier, I did not fully think it over. I would like to put in some effort as well.

314
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,460
Don't worry, everything is going smoothly on Manager Luo's end.

315
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
- Hello?
- Li Jiashang!

316
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,900
How did you offend the platform?

317
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
I waited here for three whole hours,

318
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,760
and suddenly they told me they don't want to meet. Are they trying to play with me?

319
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,160
Your own mess, clean it up yourself.

320
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,790
Looks like there's still a bit of challenge, CEO Li.

321
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,860
If it was that easy, I wouldn't have made Manager Luo personally visit them.

322
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,160
Hello, Yangyang.

323
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,090
What?

324
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,740
Break up?

325
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,330
I caught you going on blind dates,

326
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,790
how can you break up with me? I should be the one to bring it up.

327
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,250
What's up with you two?

328
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,500
Didn't you two just have a successful proposal? What's with blind dates and breaking up?

329
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,010
Sit.

330
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,820
Doctor Xia, you're Zheng He's girlfriend, right?

331
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,170
Your ring is so pretty. He bought it, right?

332
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,530
Coincidentally, I have one as well.

333
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,690
He bought this for me when we went shopping the other day.

334
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,830
Zheng He is like a wild horse. He's used to running around freely.

335
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,840
Whoever thinks that they can bring him under their control

336
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,610
will end up like me,

337
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,200
hurting black and blue.

338
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,240
Look at my head, it's even greener than a struggling stock market.
(T/N: This means he is getting cheated on.)

339
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,290
What do you mean?

340
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,870
What do I mean?

341
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,610
Break up. Are you deaf? How many times do I need to say it?

342
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,880
You tell me first.

343
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,950
You promised to marry me, why did you go see other guys?

344
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,510
Don't be too emotional, discuss the issue at hand first.

345
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,060
Right. You two have a misunderstanding.

346
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,890
Just talk it out and you'll be fine.

347
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,400
Then why don't you two try communicating better?

348
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,890
Mind your own business.

349
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,330
You. Why did you go on blind dates?

350
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,640
Let alone he was seeing someone behind my back,

351
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,070
the other girl was so low, she made me look bad.

352
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,880
No, that girl is actually a pain.

353
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,660
She chased me for so many years but I've always paid her dust.
(T/N : ignored her)

354
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,360
I guess she was affected by the proposal pictures that I posted.

355
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,210
You have to trust me. You have to trust my taste.

356
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,140
If you dare lie to me, you will never have kids.

357
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,380
Plus being struck by five thunderbolts and my corpse will be exposed on the street.

358
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,560
Yangyang, if you have anything you doubt about me in the future, you can just ask me or even slap me.

359
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,310
But don't overthink.

360
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,430
Even more, don't easily give up on me. Okay?

361
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,410
From now on, you can look at my phone whenever you want. The passcode is your birthday.

362
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,320
I'll be upset if you don't look at it.

363
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,490
You have to treat it like going to work and make it a routine.

364
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,130
Don't add to my workload. Who cares? Leave.

365
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,280
I am really not scared of you being dramatic, I am scared of you not caring at all.

366
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,120
Who are you calling dramatic? If it was anyone else,

367
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,100
is it worth me being so mad?

368
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,530
Right, right, right. It's all because of me.

369
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,810
I am so much in love, but I don't realize it.

370
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,720
Yesterday I sent my sister to her filming set.

371
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,480
She told me why you decided to return to the country.

372
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,190
Those suspicions indeed are very closely related to Lee Group.

373
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,020
You also told her that your pleasant surprise after returning was me,

374
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,360
and that you didn't want to hurt me.

375
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,790
I never said anything so melodramatic.

376
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,320
Don't think that you have lost, because I can read your thoughts.

377
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,820
Either ways, I have always loved you more.

378
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,920
Yiyi, we already lost seven years.

379
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,600
Do we have to waste more time in a pointless stalemate?

380
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,290
Actually, what Zheng He said makes a lot of sense.

381
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,760
Then if you have any doubts or questions,

382
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,980
ask me directly.

383
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,690
- You as well.
- Then I'll ask.

384
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,770
I'll ask first.

385
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,500
Why did you have someone follow me?

386
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,250
That day when I saw you almost get hit by a car outside Ming Xiu,

387
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,340
I thought someone might be targeting you.

388
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,890
Of course I had to send someone to protect you.

389
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,150
Your turn.

390
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,360
Why did you meet with Gao Mu?

391
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,330
I feel like he still knows something.

392
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,430
If I don't get all the information out of him,

393
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,360
I won't back down.

394
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,020
Turns out telling the truth is this easy.

395
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,790
For the two of us, it does seem pretty easy.

396
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,670
Yiyi, I know these years

397
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,670
you have been used to the freedom of doing everything solo.

398
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,440
But now you're not alone anymore. I hope you get used to me as well.

399
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,810
I will try my best.

400
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,470
♫ The time to catch up with a dream ♫

401
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:04,570
