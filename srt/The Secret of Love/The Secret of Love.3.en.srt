00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,600
We checked her data. She's totally unrelated to Mu Xiao.

160
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Bring it on.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,400
I keep feeling that it's her.

162
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
I keep feeling that Xia Xiyang likes me too.

- No.

Hello, CEO Li. We should strike while the iron is hot, after the big show has ended.

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,300
We should issue a special report about Lee Group.

166
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,100
Can you give me the opportunity to interview you?

167
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,700
I don't agree. It was agreed that I would be the interviewer.

168
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,800
Why is it suddenly switched to Su Yi?

169
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Feilin, stay calm. CEO Li personally asked for her.

170
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
Does it makes any sense for us to argue about this again?

171
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
Asked for her?

172
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,600
Su Yi, how could you do this for your own benefit?

173
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,100
Frankly speaking, I went through the pros and cons of you both.

174
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,000
Su Yi is CEO Li's friend. It's easier to get an exclusive scoop.

175
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,600
Friend?

176
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Do you want me to call Miss Su?

177
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,200
No need.

178
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,700
Excuse me, CEO Li.

179
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,200
Su Yi had something on for the time being. The company sent me to interview you.

180
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I made the appointment with Miss Su in advance.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,800
We can forget about others.

182
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,300
Well. CEO Li, give me a chance.

183
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
CEO Li?

184

Please leave.

Director Su!

186
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,200
Are you that happy to steal other people's work?

187
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,900
Of course, it's not that happy compared to you who have a benefactor to help you.

188
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
- CEO LI.
- Director Su.

Do you know how long he waited–

190
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Sorry, CEO Li.

191
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
I know you hate people being late the most.

192
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,600
But I'm hoping you can give me a chance to explain.

193
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm really busy.

194
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
Then, can we schedule another time?

195
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay.

196
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,320
Thanks, CEO Li. I'll talk about it with your assistant.

197

Aren't you using unscrupulous methods? It's either stealing or grabbing.

If Ming Xiu doesn't do well, we will have a hard time.

If you want to continue messing around,

it's best to change to a smarter young guy next time.

Why don't I take you now to confront him?

Hello, Ding Hang.

Are you okay? I heard you were at the police station.

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,570
No. I wanted to stop her but couldn't.

So, how was it? I taught you the

216
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,800
Krav Maga self-defense technique. Did it work?

217
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,550
It can be considered as a near miss today.

218
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,670
If you encounter danger next time,

219
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,780
just use this technique.

When the disciple masters the technique, the master will lose her job.

223
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,790
Let's be serious. I have always been thinking of asking you.

224
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,400
Did you recall anything?

225
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,050
I always thought that if I went back to a familiar environment,

226
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,540
there would always be some stimulus.

227
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,850
But... I don't feel anything at all.

228
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,570
Then do you think

229
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,150
it could possibly be due to this?

230
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,950
I read a research study

231
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,680
stating that one has amnesia because they can't face a certain period of time.

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,700
And there's selective amnesia.

233
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,910
It's also considered a kind of self-protection mechanism.

234
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,220
What if... I'm saying what if

235
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,030
you really want to recall the past,

236

♫ Say less comforting words will make me better ♫

319
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,030
♫ If you still love me, don’t say it out ♫

320
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:19,850
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to sing this love song ♫

321
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,450
♫ Just blame me not knowing how to wish you happy ♫

322
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,640
♫ Distance has made our photo faded ♫

323
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,740
♫ My heart is still hot ♫

324
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,960
♫ The seasons have changed ♫

325
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,220
♫ How many people left to make my heart beat? ♫

326
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:47,280
♫ Just blame me not knowing I disqualified by loving too much ♫

327
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,250
♫ Just blame me not knowing our distance is like a galaxy ♫

328
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,040
♫ On the travelling train ♫

329
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,200
♫ You first get off ♫

330
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,280
♫ Only leave the time to heal with me  ♫
