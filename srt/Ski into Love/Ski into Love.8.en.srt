Stop pretending.

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,900
make yourself look good.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,290
I ordered health supplements for you.

When Yiming is here tomorrow,

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,660
go and pick up the supplements with him.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,890
Then,

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,170
you can bring him around

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,170
when did you

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,610
become a father?

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,850
This is a habit from my work.

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,410
Every comic artist is the same.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,170
You're still drawing comics?

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,980
I remember you like

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,660
drawing stick figures on the side of your exam papers.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,220
It's great

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,100
to keep doing your hobby

71
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,940
for so long.

72
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,060

73

75
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,570

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,940

78
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,410
is completely different

79
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,170
from your parents.

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,220
First of all,

81
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,940
all jobs deserve equal respect.

82
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,130
Moreover,

83
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,220

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,010
sticking to your dreams

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,170
and keep doing what you love

86
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,260
is very meaningful

87
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,570
in itself.

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,730
If you like drawing comics,

89
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,730
keep it up.

90
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,260

93
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,690
if this job

94
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,890
doesn't make you money,

95
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,340

102
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,220

110
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,460
don't tell Mom

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,410
that I'm drawing comics.

112
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,370
Otherwise, she might get mad again.

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,140
Don't worry.

114
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,580

115
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,340

about the six types of neck arthritis.

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,410
First, let me talk about yours.

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,020
It's called cervical spondylosis.

136
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,660
It is also known as localized cervical spondylosis.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,980
It consists of pains in your head, shoulder, neck, arms,

138
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,250
and other pain points.

139
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,660
If we look at

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,810
an X-ray film,

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,050
there's no obvious narrowing

142
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,660
in the intervertebral area

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,850
of the cervical spine.

144
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,900
However,

145
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,700
there are some biological changes

146
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,370
when looking at the cervical spine.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,980
The second type

148
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,140
is called

149
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,700
cervical radiculopathy.

150
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,020
It has some

151
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,900

194
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,220
Come in quickly.

195
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,770
Let me help you carry it.

196
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,940
Let's go.

197
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,700
Daxiong.

198
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,220
I heard you singing

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,850
from the entrance.

200
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,180
It's okay, I guess.

201
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,300
I've prepared

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,340
your favorite room.

203
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,820
Let me input your information.

204
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,130
Master,

205
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,130
we are not skiing today.

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,850
No.

207
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,340
Hao Tian and Rui

208
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,130
have arranged everything

209
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,850
at the usual spot.

210
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,180
All right.

211
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,700
Thanks.

212
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,980
All right. Let's go.

213
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,220
Which floor?

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,300
Help me decant the wine.

215
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,580
Sure.

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,940
Thanks.

217
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,940
Yiming,

218
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,010
why must you sit beside me?

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,490
Where should I sit?

220
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,220
Let Nanfeng sit here.

221
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,340
It's so interesting.

222
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,010
Hello, Mrs. Wei.

223
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,980
It has been so long.

224
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,130
Yiming.

225
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,220
Why are you calling me Mrs. Wei?

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,060
You sound like a stranger.

227
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,180
We are a family.

228
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,580
Come and sit.

229
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,490
Sit down. Quick.

230
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,220
Sit.

231
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,980
You are not an outsider.

232
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,980
Sit over there.

233
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,370
Sit.

234
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,340
Sit down.

235
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,890
I'm sitting here.

236
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,730
Zhi,

237
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,220
what do you like to eat?

238
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,300
Place the order.

239
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,980
You've accompanied him

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,700
the whole day.

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,180
I'm sure you are exhausted.

242
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,010
Order some dishes you like

243
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,300
to reward yourself.

244
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,890
He is paying.

245
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,130
Don't be frugal on his behalf.

246
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,730
It's fine, Mr. Jiang.

247
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,420
You can place the order.

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,300
Anything's fine with me.

249
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,010
Order the most expensive dishes then.

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,130
Waiter.

251
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,890
Order.

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,220
I heard from Nan

253
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,700
that both of you went skiing a few days ago.

254
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,130
Was it fun?

255
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,420
It was quite fun.

256
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,940
This brat

257
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,340
is always running around.

258
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,940
She thinks she's a child

259
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,610
as long as she's still single.

260
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,770
She just can't settle down.

261
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,580
My children are the same.

262
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,180
They are different.

263
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,980
Nan has her own company.

264
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,130
Yiming has achieved academic success.

265
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,180
He has a bright future ahead.

266
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,010
That's not right.

267
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,730
Zhi has always been

268
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,220
a cute and smart girl.

269
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,980
I dream of having her

270
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,650
as my daughter.

271
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,100
Great, Mom.

272
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
No wonder you despise me usually.

273
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,770
You are very disobedient.

274
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,730
Of course, I despise you.

275
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,700
Later, I'll exchange my children

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,490
with yours.

277
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,010
I'll gladly accept them then.

278
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,770
Of course.

279
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,340
Cheers!

280
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,490
Hao Tian, bottoms up!

281
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,770
Master, Hu called me

282
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,700
two days ago.

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,180
She wanted to apologize to you for what happened back then.

284
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,850
She didn't perform well during the lesson.

285
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,980
It's fine.

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,340
It's done over here.

287
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,530
- Thank you, Chong. - Thank you, Master.

288
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,300
She still wants to learn from you.

289
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,980
She told me she wanted to stay at Xicheng.

290
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,610
It's a waste of money.

291
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,460
Tell her

292
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,340
that I'm not teaching the basics.

293
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,060
I told her

294
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,300
but she saw you

295
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,610
teaching Zhi the sideslip.

296
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,250
Tell her

297
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,940
that Zhi is the only person I've taught.

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,060
For basics,

299
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,890
I'll only teach Zhi in the future.

300
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,530
You spoil her so much.

301
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,490
Beici,

302
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,850
I'll only ski with you in the future.

303
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,100
Beici,

304
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,340
I'll only teach you in the future

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,940
how to be human.

306
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,890
Cheers.

307
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,300
Cheers.

308
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,940
Let's enjoy.

309
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,180
- Cheers. - Cheers.

310
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,180
Yiming,

311
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,770
you were in Germany for many years.

312
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,370
Do you have a girlfriend?

313
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,650
No.

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,890
I was busy focusing on my studies

315
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,580
when I was abroad.

316
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,460
I had no time.

317
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,700
My priority is my studies.

318
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,340
Moreover,

319
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,370
I don't have anyone I fancy.

320
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,100
Do you have such a high standard?

321
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,370
Most importantly,

322
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,730
I've set the bar pretty high.

323
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,850
This brat

324
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,220
has someone he fancies.

325
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,490
Zhi, what about you?

326
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,490
Do you have someone you like?

327
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,220
She doesn't like

328
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,250
to socialize with others usually.

329
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,100
Her personality is way worse

330
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,300
compared to Yiming.

331
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,130
She also doesn't go to work.

332
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,460
How will she have someone she likes

333
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,820
when she doesn't even have a colleague?

334
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,180
Nan,

335
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,340
I suddenly remember this.

336
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,180
Zhi used to say

337
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,940
that she wanted to marry into our family.

338
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,530
Did something like that happen?

339
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,530
It was Ming's birthday.

340
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,130
Have you forgotten?

341
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,340
Why don't I remember?

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,700
It was

343
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,420
on Ming's tenth birthday

344
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,420
when they first met.

345
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,250
Zhi was only eight years old back then.

346
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,490
She came to me and said,

347
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,580
"Mrs. Jiang,

348
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,340
Yiming is so handsome.

349
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,420
I want to marry him in the future."

350
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,180
At eight years old, I was too young.

351
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,130
I was still a childish girl

352
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,130
who knew nothing.

353
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,130
Do you think you are mature now?

354
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,490
Master,

355
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,250
why didn't you

356
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,220
ask Zhi to join us?

357
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,130
Yes.

358
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,010
She...

359
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,340
Why would I call her?

360
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,730
Master,

361
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,820
I want to see Zhi

362
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,060
skiing the Aven Avenue, too.

363
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,100
She can carry

364
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,890
her tortoise

365
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,250
and flop around.

366
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,530
Right?

367
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,130
Isn't it cute?

368
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,770
You want her to ski

369
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,770
at one of the three most difficult slopes

370
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,730
in the country?

371
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,850
You should hope for the best.

372
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,820
You hear that?

373
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,820
Hope for the best.

374
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,490
Well,

375
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,940
Master is around.

376
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,610
What's there to be afraid of?

377
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,980
He will surely protect Zhi.

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,650
Eat

379
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,370
and stuff your mouth.

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,340
Come.

381
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,420
Cheers.

382
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,770
Come on.

383
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,730
Let's drink.

384
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,180
Let's drink.

385
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,060

580

591
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,860

592

734
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,620
your priority now

735
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,420
is the

How is your preparation?

738
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,010
Tell me about it.

739
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,140
I'm going to draw about figure skating.

740
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm currently gathering materials.

741
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,660
I chose this project

742
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,250
because

743
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,620
figure skating

744
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,620
is relatively popular

745
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,330
among winter sports

746
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,530
and has a wider audience.

747
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,730
This project

748
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,250
is also highly enjoyable.

749
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,460
I think

750
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,220
the drawing style is romance

751
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,010
and fantasy.

752
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,140
It suits

753
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,250
the tone of a comic aimed at young girls.

754
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,330
No problem.

755
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,770
It's decided then.

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,810

757
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,900
we can be confident,

758
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,570
right?

759
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,290

764
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,900

765
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,700
Wei Zhi's fame

766
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,460
is not related to her skills.

767

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,250
Mr. Zhang Yu as her strategist.

769
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:34,940
Understand?

770
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,140
That's too much praise.

772
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,860
All right.

773
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,330
Let's begin with

774
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,380
the ice-themed project.

775
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,980
What are your ideas?

776
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,700
Let's discuss it.

777
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,290
It's in my USB drive.

778
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,330
Let me get it for you from my seat.

779
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,140
Sure.

780
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,700
What do you think

781
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,220
about our creativity?

782
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,220
It's not bad, right?

783
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,140
We just finished a meeting

784
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,250
and there's another meeting later.

785
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,940
At eleven?

786
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,010
There's no time to eat.

787
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,180
Exactly.

788
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,180
Seriously.

790
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,250
Since you are wearing such a cute outfit,

791
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,980
let me draw you

an employee tag

793
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,330
as an employment ritual.

794
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,460
All right.

796

798
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,050
What do you think? Does it look like you?

799

It does.

800
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,290

802
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,900
in pursuit of your dream.

803
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,090
Over here,

804
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,090
you need to take note of the character's design.

805
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,330
Draw a small image first.

806
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,380
Otherwise, they might look the same.

807

Also,

808
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,730
the facial features must be more detailed.

809
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,140
This looks a little rough.

810
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,700
You can focus on

811
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,220
drawing the shape of the eyes.

812
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,700

813
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,010
and the colors are the purest.

814
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,810
Try them out bit by bit.

815
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,250
Cookies are the best.

816
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,010

Hug it tightly.

825
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,380
What should I name the new comic?

826
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,780
Anyway. I should write the story first.

829
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,340
Hello, Elephant.

830
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,530
Wei Zhi,

831
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,090
do you know what kind of boss

832
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,980
is the most annoying?

833
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,130
It's the kind

834
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,260
who only talks about relationships

835
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,300
and not about money.

836
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,460
No.

837
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,420
No.

838
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,780
Elephant, listen to me.

839
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,820
I... I can pay you.

840
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,690
I have savings.

841
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,090
There's a bonus if I win the competition.

842
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,740
I mean I'll enter the new comic

843
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,940

844
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,420
Wei Zhi,

845
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,780
I don't draw comics

846
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,940
for money.

847
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,300
I draw comics

00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,050
thanks for talking to me.

909
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,700
You're welcome.

910
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,700
It's what I should do.

911
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,170
However...

912
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,050
Are there any problems

913
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,380
with this project?

914
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,300
Do you really like figure skating?

915
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,420
I don't think I like it.

916
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,220
I chose this project

917
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,010
because it is

918
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,610
more suitable to be entered into the competition.

919
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,570
This is a suitable theme indeed.

920
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,650
It's also a good choice.

921
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,940
However,

922
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,970
what's suitable might not be the best sometimes.

923
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,610
A good choice might also not be the best choice.

924
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,570
Something you like

925
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,130
is perhaps the best choice.

926
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,970
I remember

927
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,570
I said the same to Wei Zhi.

928
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,970
In the beginning,

929
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,860
there weren't many people who had high hopes for "Farewell Song".

930
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,650
I'm sure you are clear about this.

931
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,610
However, it became popular.

932
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,970
Wei Zhi made it popular.

933
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,740
Not just her.

934
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,530
You as well.

935
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,420
Both of you...

936
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,900
Mr. Zhang Yu,

937
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,090
there's no need to say this.

938
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,090
The data of "Farewell Song" was bad

939
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,650
when I handled it.

940
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,740
Everyone knows about that.

941
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,380
I like "Farewell Song" a lot

942
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,130
but liking it means nothing.

943
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,170
I'm just a proxy.

944
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,050
If it does well,

945
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,820
I can't take any credit.

946
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,530
If it doesn't do well,

947
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,090
it's not my fault as well.

948
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,340
I know.

949
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,610
No matter what,

950
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,650
I'm not as good as Wei Zhi.

951
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,420
You've misunderstood.

952
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,530
I don't mean that.

953
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,860
Sorry, Mr. Zhang Yu.

954
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,610
I will consider

955
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,450
what you told me.

all of Farewell Song's copyright?

960

That's what it says on the contract.

961
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,010
Good.

962
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,530

Mr. Wang,

968
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,380
however, there were indeed

969
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,170
some unfair terms

970
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,260
when we signed the contract

971
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,300
with Wei Zhi.

972
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,420
If she wants to sue us...

973
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,260
She wouldn't dare.

974
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,860
Enough.

975
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,090
Get back to work.

It's because
