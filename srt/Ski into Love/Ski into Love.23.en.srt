Dai Duo!

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,850
You're the best!

390
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,460
Shan Chong!

391
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,220
Chong, I came here to see you!

392
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,010
Thank you for making my dream come true!

393
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,460
Both of them are my students!

394
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,820
Congrats.

395
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,100
What did I say back then?

396
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,580
You said

397
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,340
we'd stand on the world stage together,

398
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,010
representing China.

399
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,250
And win together.

400
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,530
And win together!

401
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,620
[One month later]

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,700
What did Mom say?

403
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,980
What do you mean, Mom?

404
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,010
That's my mom.

405
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,610
You're not trying to steal my mom, are you?

406
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,730
I wouldn't dare.

407
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,250
What are you thinking about?

408
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,580
I just can't believe your mom

409
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,060
accepted me

410
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,130
so easily.

411
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,340
Even now,

412
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,010
it still feels like a dream.

413
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,130
That's because

414
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,820
my mom loves me.

415
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,490
And?

416
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,700
And...

417
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,180
And because you're amazing.

418
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,890
And?

419
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,940
And...

420
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,600
And because you love me.

421
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,010
And?

422
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,340
And because I love you.

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,940
Hello, Chong. Where are you?

424
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,330
Just got to the lobby.

425
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,880
Hurry up.

426
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm upstairs, waiting

427
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,420
by the elevator.

428
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,050
We're in the elevator now.

429
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,290
Okay. Got it.

430
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,810
Long time no see.

431
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,010
Long time no see.

432
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,730
Yan.

433
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,860
Jiang!

434
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,180
Zhi!

435
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,860
You're here too?

436
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,380
Long time no see.

437
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,460
I've missed you.

438
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,010
Me too!

439
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,050
Really?

440
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,730
But I feel like

441
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,420
you're too in love

442
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,380
to even notice me.

443
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,730
That's not true.

444
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,140
You're always my number one.

445
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,050
I missed you.

446
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,050
Hey, Yan.

447
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,810
By the way,

448
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,660
where are Beici and the others?

449
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,090
They're on the slopes.

450
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,090
Then why are you here?

451
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,420
To wait for you guys.

452
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,380
Hello?

453
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,090
Look ahead.

454
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,810
Where?

455
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,380
Look ahead, you idiot.

456
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,490
Over here.

457
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,290
Why are you standing there?

458
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,380
Get over here.

459
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,900
Nope.

460
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,660
You come to me.

461
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,660
Looks like someone needs a lesson.

462
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,290
Let's go.

463
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:56,900
Alright.

464
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,050
Why did you make me

465
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,620
come over?

466
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,250
Shan!

467
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,770
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

468
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,900
Wouldn't that ruin the surprise?

469
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,180
Didn't you say you wouldn't come

470
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,140
until you finished those chapters?

471
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,250
Oh, Zhi, you have no idea.

472
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,570
I pulled three all-nighters so I could

473
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,140
come snowboarding with you guys!

474
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,770
That figures.

475
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,330
I'm so happy

476
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,220
we can all be together.

477
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,130
This is amazing!

478
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,380
Oh right, Zhi,

479
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,860
I want

480
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,660
to talk to you

481
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,440
about the comic...

482
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,140
Alright, enough.

483
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,050
Let's check in first.

484
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,700
Alright.

485
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,730
Let's talk later.

486
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,490
Alright.

487
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,050
Let's go.

488
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,700
Are you up to something?

489
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,420
I have a question for you.

490
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,180
What kind of proposals

491
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,730
do girls

492
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,140
usually like?

493
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,460
Are you getting married?

494
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,220
Keep it down.

495
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,900
I knew it!

496
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,660
When's the wedding?

497
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,620
It's a proposal,

498
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,810
okay?

499
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,490
She has to

500
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,140
say yes first.

501
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,010
This is wonderful!

502
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,090
You're finally getting married!

503
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,220
Zhi is going to be

504
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,810
my master's wife!

505
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,660
Like I said,

506
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,010
she has to

507
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,250
say yes to my proposal

508
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,050
first.

509
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,810
Right...

510
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,730
You're right.

511
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,290
You're asking the right person,

512
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,090
though I've never been proposed to before.

513
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,220
But trust me,

514
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,050
for a girl,

515
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,980
the proposal matters even more than the wedding.

516
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,730
Because when you

517
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,860
take out the ring

518
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,900
and ask her to marry you,

519
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,550
that's the moment

520
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,570
she truly believes you mean it.

521
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,280
A proposal

522
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,250
should be a surprise.

523
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,620
It needs three things:

524
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,370
the perfect ring, roses,

525
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,770
and your sincerity.

526
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,900
One more thing.

527
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,730
- Whatever you do, don't... - Master, Huayan!

528
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,380
Keep it a secret.

529
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,980
Don't let him find out!

530
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,900
Look, I bought all this food.

531
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,900
Let's eat together.

532
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,050
- Sure. - I'm not hungry.

533
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,980
I'll go grab something to eat.

534
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,220
But, Master...

535
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,490
What were you two talking about?

536
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,380
I... uh...

537
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,090
I'm not hungry either.

538
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,380
I'll go take a shower.

539
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,750
Why are you both leaving the moment I get here?

540
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,730
Hua said

541
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,770
there's a game to play.

542
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,010
Oh yeah?

543
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,810
Yeah, didn't she tell you?

544
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Nope.

545
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,140
Then why did you bring me here?

546
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,620
Huayan.

547
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,660
I'm here!

548
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,050
Hello!

549
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,490
Zhi, I won!

550
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,420
I want to play too.

551
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,980
I want to play this one.

552
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,570
I'll play with you later.

553
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,290
First, come smash a golden egg with me.

554
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,050
How did I miss it?

555
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,010
Try the one in the middle.

556
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,110
The middle one?

557
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,920
Oh, bad choice.

558
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,870
If you pick

559
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,440
the middle one,

560
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,980
you'll probably get nothing.

561
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,330
These ones here seem luckier.

562
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,730
Try one of those.

563
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,530
So which one?

564
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,250
This one or that one.

565
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,770
That one looks promising too.

566
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,530
That one, then?

567
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,090
I'll smash this one, okay?

568
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,860
Go ahead.

569
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,380
Okay.

570
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,530
So many questions.

571
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,900
Hua, you're amazing!

572
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,940
A dinner voucher for two!

573
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,730
Not bad.

574
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,490
But it's not the grand prize.

575
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,530
Who wants to go to dinner with me

576
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,140
Why didn't you guys call me for the game?

577
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,470
He...

578
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,050
Who's that?

579
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,780
Beici.

580
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,490
Beici...

581
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,660
I want to play too.

582
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,570
Don't...

583
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,570
- You're too late. - Who's playing with me?

584
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,380
Who's playing with me?

585
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,620
This egg looks pretty good.

586
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,460
Try the middle one.

587
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,220
Zhi, come play with me!

588
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,010
Come on!

589
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,050
- Why me? - Beici!

590
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,050
It's fine.

591
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,050
I'll play with him.

592
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,940
Beici!

593
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,330
I'll go watch.

594
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,220
Let's go.

595
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,730
I'm great

596
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,380
at playing games, you know.

597
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,580
You'd better not

598
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,980
go easy on me.

599
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,660
Don't worry. I won't.

600
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,420
Alright then, watch this!

601
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,770
No rush.

602
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,700
Take it slow.

603
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,700
Just imagine that's Beici's head.

604
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,530
Right.

605
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,860
And then smash it.

606
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,220
Actually, it does look like him.

607
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,380
Go, Zhi!

608
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,290
Take this, Beici!

609
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,810
Hah!

610
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,250
Ugh, you're so annoying.

611
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,360
My turn!

612
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,490
Alright, watch and learn!

613
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,940
Hah!

614
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,900
Why?

615
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,180
Beici!

616
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,050
It's okay.

617
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,050
You did well.

618
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,250
Better luck next time, Zhi.

619
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,220
When you play,

620
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,530
you should go all in, right?

621
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,460
Will you shut up already?

622
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,010
How about one more round?

623
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,490
You know the rule. Play to win, right?

624
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,180
Zhi?

625
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,620
Thanks. Congrats,

626
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,140
Beici.

627
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,050
Zhi?

628
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,770
Do you want to go again?

629
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
Nah, I'm done.

630
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,770
You guys go ahead.

631
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,530
Jiang Nanfeng and I

632
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,920
are hitting the buffet.

633
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,490
Let's go.

634
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,090
Let's go.

635
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,380
Zhi...

636
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,900
Well then.

637
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,570
I'll go smash some golden eggs!

638
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,860
Which one should I smash?

639
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,770
Come on, Master.

640
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,660
Someone had to lose, right?

641
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,380
Besides, Zhi

642
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,530
agreed to play with me.

643
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,180
Right.

644
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,570
Here, smash this one.

645
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,860
- Go ahead. - This one?

646
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,180
Alright.

647
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,040
Gosh.

648
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,600
A ring?

649
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,730
Don't ever let me see you again.

650
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,050
Chong,

651
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,810
he's sorry.

652
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,050
Master,

653
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,700
I messed up.

654
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,460
Give me a chance

655
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,700
to make it up to you!

656
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,700
I did some research

657
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,980
and read through

658
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,220
every proposal guide.

659
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,420
And?

660
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,660
And here's

661
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,330
what I've learned:

662
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,980
A perfect proposal needs three things:

663
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,010
the right time,

664
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,900
the right place,

665
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,050
and the right people.

666
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,010
Wow, mind-blowing insight.

667
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,570
Let me finish.

668
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,810
We need music,

669
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,330
lighting, and flowers.

670
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,980
Get to the point.

671
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,770
The point is,

672
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,810
I found the best place

673
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,620
in the hotel for a proposal.

674
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,770
The bar downstairs.

675
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,250
All we need to do is get Zhi there,

676
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,010
let her have a drink,

677
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,380
get her a little tipsy,

678
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,900
- and boom... - Hold on.

679
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,700
What exactly are you

680
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,530
suggesting?

681
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,660
He's saying

682
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,370
if Zhi isn't drunk,

683
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,690
you'll have no chance of getting a "yes."

684
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,330
Right?

685
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,400
What?

686
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
That's not what I meant!

687
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,570
If she gets wasted, will she even remember it?

688
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,180
Okay, fine.

689
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,530
Forget the drinking part.

690
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,490
But listen.

691
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,090
First, we decorate the place.

692
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,730
Then, when the mood is right

693
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,140
and Master gives the signal,

694
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,520
we bring out the flowers,

695
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,380
balloons,

696
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,640
and all that.

697
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,590
And finally,

698
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,530
Master walks up to Zhi,

699
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,770
takes out the ring,

700
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,420
and boom! She says yes!

701
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,460
Do you think

702
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,580
it'll work?

703
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,570
It sounds like a solid plan.

704
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,180
As long as Beici stays out of it.

705
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,530
Are you on a diet?

706
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,660
Yep, I am.

707
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,330
How disciplined.

708
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,010
Where are Huayan

709
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,940
and the others?

710
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,510
They just got back from the slopes.

711
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,660
They'll be here after they change.

712
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,140
I'll call and hurry them up.

713
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,570
No need.

714
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,330
Yan said they're on the way.

715
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,700
Thanks.

716
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,570
Here,

717
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,660
try the house special.

718
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,530
You try it first.

719
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,220
If it's good, I'll have some.

720
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,090
Look at you two.

721
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,460
Dating has made you both dumb, huh?

722
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,530
- What a disgustingly cute couple. - It's good.

723
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,180
You try it too.

724
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,770
It really is good.

725
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm going to the restroom real quick.

726
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,180
Sit down already.

727
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,940
Master,

728
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,980
how's it going?

729
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,790
Is she here?

730
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,880
Yeah.

731
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,780
Chong, do you have the ring?

732
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,290
Yes.

733
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,350
Master,

734
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,990
look.

735
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,860
We're ready too.

736
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,800
You've got this, Master.

737
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,380
Just don't cause any trouble.

738
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,290
Don't jinx it.

739
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,420
It's definitely happening this time!

740
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,770
Let's go.

741
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,490
Today is

742
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,980
a very special day.

743
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,420
One of our guests

744
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,620
is proposing to the love of his life.

745
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,770
Someone's proposing?

746
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,460
Could it be Shan Chong?

747
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,330
No way...

748
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,730
Don't just stand there. Go!

749
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,860
Thanks, guys.

750
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,140
Go!

751
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,700
Is he really proposing?

752
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,090
Now, let's all give them

753
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,530
our heartfelt blessings!

754
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,770
This is so romantic!

755
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,180
Today is your birthday

756
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,250
and our 1,001st day

757
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,440
together.

758
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,480
I love you.

759
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,690
Will you marry me?

760
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,000
Say yes!

761
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,040
Say yes!

762
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,730
Say yes!

763
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,700
Kiss!

764
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,770
Kiss!

765
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,700
Kiss!

766
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,570
Was this

767
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,660
part of our plan?

768
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,770
Did we just get upstaged?

769
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,700
Seems like it.

770
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,660
So, do we still

771
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,180
go out there?

772
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,140
Someone just proposed, huh?

773
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,180
Yeah.

774
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,900
Guess we lucked out. Cheers.

775
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,940
It's nice

776
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,050
to witness something like this.

777
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,810
Raise your glasses.

778
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,620
Cheers.

779
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,730
Yeah, we're really lucky.

780
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,180
Is Master going to...?

781
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,220
What's wrong?

782
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,770
I...

783
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,250
Is there something you want to say?

784
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,940
Wei Zhi,

785
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,730
I want to tell you...

786
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,980
♪Let me stand under the snow♪

787
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,620
♪So that you remain warm next to me♪

788
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,460
♪Crossing stitches♪

789
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,140
♪To weave this moment for you♪

790
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,900
♪Let the snow keep my silence♪

791
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,620
♪As I fall with you into the depths♪

792
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,580
♪Shining like fireworks♪

793
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,100
♪Not as warm as holding you close♪

794
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,180
Time to leave.

795
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,700
Let's go.

796
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,700
Chong,

797
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,980
you were this close!

798
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,940
What happened?

799
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,860
Are you proposing or not?

800
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,810
You think I don't want to?

801
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,220
Didn't you already

802
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,460
go into her room?

803
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,180
Yeah.

804
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,460
She suddenly went to the bathroom.

805
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,330
I...

806
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,980
I just didn't get the right moment.

807
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,460
So you had time for a kiss

808
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,660
but not for a proposal?

809
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,420
How about this?

810
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,220
Let's ask someone with actual sense

811
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,420
for advice.

812
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,770
So you dragged me here in the middle of the night

813
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,810
just because

814
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,900
he wants to propose?

815
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,380
I can't help you.

816
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,190
Plenty of dating experience,

817
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,140
but zero proposal experience.

818
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,140
Besides, I have no plans to get married.

819
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,140
Master,

820
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,570
I have an idea.

821
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,810
No, you don't.

822
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,010
Listen, Master.

823
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,620
You should

824
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,900
make a cake for Zhi yourself

825
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,220
and secretly hide the ring inside.

826
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,770
She'll find the ring

827
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,420
while eating,

828
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,010
and with the right atmosphere,

829
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,730
you'll come off as both thoughtful

830
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,460
and romantic.

831
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,460
Chong, I think this

832
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,090
might actually work.

833
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,490
It's lame.

834
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,980
What if she swallows the ring?

835
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,980
Shan Chong,

836
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,900
there are a million ways to propose.

837
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,940
Creativity and surprise

838
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,900
are just the basics.

839
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,330
What matters most

840
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,140
is you.

841
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,380
Why are you proposing?

842
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,490
Where are you proposing?

843
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,090
What does this moment

844
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,010
mean

845
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,090
to both Wei Zhi and you?

846
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,010
Listen to your own heart.

847
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,460
The most important person in this is you.

848
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,570
Got it?

849
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,740
Hey everyone!

850
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,380
I'm Beici the Bear!

851
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,460
Welcome to Mount 2800!

852
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,530
Can you even walk

853
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,300
in those heavy pants and boots?

854
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,850
Romantic. So romantic.

855
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,340
Absolutely breathtaking!

856
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,460
It's stunning!

857
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,900
This place is unreal, Beici.

858
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,570
You nailed this vlog location.

859
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,740
Of course!

860
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,900
I picked it out just for Mas...

861
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,210
For my

862
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,210
world-class vlog!

863
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,650
So, Master,

864
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,380
are you satisfied?

865
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,570
Of course he is!

866
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,900
Come on.

867
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,610
Take some gorgeous shots for me.

868
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,740
Hold that up.

869
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,170
Alright.

870
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,690
Three, two, one.

871
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,940
Say cheese!

872
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,740
I'll take one for you.

873
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:23,980
Sure.

874
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,570
Alright.

875
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,650
Got it.

876
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,490
Take a look.

877
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,210
Beici!

878
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,690
Yan! Zhao Keyan!

879
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,460
Zhao Keyan!

880
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,650
Oh, you two.

881
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,860
They're fighting!

882
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,860
You two are such kids.

883
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,010
Don't forget

884
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,420
today's theme

885
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,090
is "Romance at 2800."

886
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,610
Right.

887
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,380
Alright,

888
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,210
now,

889
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,740
let's do some acting.

890
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,380
I'll be the director.

891
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,130
Let's do the first scene.

892
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,340
As for the leads...

893
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,010
Beici,

894
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,180
you're the male lead.

895
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,980
And Huayan,

896
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,530
you're the female lead.

897
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,340
Why not you two?

898
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,170
Quit messing around!

899
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,860
Come on, let's do this!

900
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,130
Now,

901
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,090
just follow

902
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,930
my directions.

903
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,570
- Let's do this. - Alright.

904
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,490
On this magnificent

905
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,570
snow-capped mountain,

906
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,440
Beici gently takes Huayan's hand.

907
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,420
This is dumb.

908
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,090
Come on!

909
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,550
Three, two, one,

910
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,130
action!

911
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,980
These two are hilarious.

912
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,820
My beautiful Huayan,

913
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,050
would you grant me the honor of this dance?

914
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,380
Huayan

915
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,130
gracefully walks to Beici.

916
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,260
The two of them start

917
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,820
dancing romantically at the snowy peak.

918
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,130
Alright. Now Huayan

919
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,980
twirls.

920
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,210
And Beici twirls.

921
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,010
Beautiful.

922
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,820
You just tripped me!

923
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,580
- That hurt! - I'm sorry...

924
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,300
Let's try again.

925
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,090
- It hurts! - Alright.

926
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,900
You two are out.

927
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,740
Worst actors ever.

928
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,820
Come on, one more chance!

929
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,530
Nope.

930
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,570
Please, one last shot!

931
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,210
Guess who's up next!

932
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,940
That would be Zhi

933
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,570
and Master!

934
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,210
Let me walk you two

935
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,900
through the scene.

936
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,300
Alright.

937
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,530
Once again, our leading couple

938
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,740
arrives at the snowy peak of Mount 2800.

939
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,960
Zhi is mesmerized

940
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,570
by the stunning view

941
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,170
and slowly walks

942
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,420
toward the edge.

943
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,650
Then,

944
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,750
Chong approaches

945
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,210
from behind and gently wraps

946
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,300
his arms around her waist.

947
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,340
Together, they take in

948
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,260
the breathtaking scenery.

949
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,940
Got it?

950
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,380
Any lines?

951
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,210
You can

952
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,900
improvise,

953
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,100
alright? Let's do this.

954
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,170
- Alright. - I'll give you a high-angle shot.

955
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,170
- Three, two, one. - I'm going up first, then.

956
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,780
Action!

957
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,980
Zhi slowly walks toward the edge of the mountain.

958
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,940
What a stunning view!

959
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,860
Now,

960
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,650
Chong

961
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,980
quietly approaches from behind.

962
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,260
Zhi waits in silence.

963
