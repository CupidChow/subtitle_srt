00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,810
The prize money is good.

382
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,250
After retiring,

383
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,180
I'm considering

384
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,620
becoming the national team's coach.

385
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,660
Don't worry.

386
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,810
The income

387
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,090
won't be lower than what you see now.

388
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,940
Are you trying to marry my daughter

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,460
or get a loan from me

390
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,090
by showing me

391
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,220
these bank statements?

392
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:42,980
Sit down.

393
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,330
Actually, does it matter

394
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,530
whether you earn more or less?

395
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,940
Wei Zhi is my

396
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,770
one and only daughter.

397
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,010
What's mine is hers.

398
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,620
Mr. Wei,

399
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,420
what's mine is also hers.

400
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,810
Moreover, I will

401
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,570
have a more stable career.

402
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,700
I won't be traveling around.

403
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,290
- Don't worry, I... - That's enough.

404
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,770
While both of you

405
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,620
were separated,

406
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,940
I could see

407
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,980
that Zhi was very unhappy.

408
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,380
As a father,

409
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,570
I've worked hard all my life

410
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,770
for one thing only.

411
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,770
I hope my daughter

412
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,860
can be happy.

413
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,620
Mr. Wei,

414
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,730
I understand all of your concerns.

415
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,530
While I was training

416
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,460
at the training center,

417
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,810
I thought about many things.

418
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,620
I understand your concerns

419
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,570
just like

420
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,730
how I understand my parents.

421
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,770
However, I've been thinking

422
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,010
that if I missed out on Wei Zhi,

423
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,290
after many years from now,

424
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,330
will I regret

425
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,180
that I'm not being brave enough today

426
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,290
for the rest of my life?

427
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,330
In this world,

428
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,290
it's not difficult

429
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,900
to find someone to live your life with you.

430
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,570
However, meeting someone

431
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,460
who loves each other

432
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,460
and understands each other

433
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,940
is something worth cherishing

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,090
in my opinion.

435
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,980
I don't want to give up on Wei Zhi.

436
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,010
I want to work hard for her sake

437
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,530
just like how you did.

438
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,290
For Mrs. Wei and Wei Zhi,

439
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,570
you'd work hard your whole life

440
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,420
to make them

441
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,250
happy.

442
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,900
Wei Zhi is the one

443
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,420
whom I want to work hard my whole life for.

444
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,730
So, I know very well

445
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,420
that I'm not the only person in my life.

446
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,460
There's Wei Zhi as well.

447
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,420
I know

448
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,490
we might face difficulties

449
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,620
and obstacles

450
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,940
in the future.

451
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,140
However, I believe

452
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,180
we will stand side by side

453
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,140
and face them together.

454
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,900
All of this

455
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,180
will only happen

456
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,330
if we can be together

457
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,180
right now.

458
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,660
I'm touched

459
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,010
by your words.

460
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,660
I can hear that.

461
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,660
That means

462
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,330
you will

463
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,090
not give up on Wei Zhi

464
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,290
no matter what, right?

465
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,730
That's right.

466
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,700
You won't give up

467
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,050
even if I and her mother don't agree,

468
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,530
right?

469
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,050
I will continue to work hard.

470
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,090
Even if it doesn't work this time,

471
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,180
there's still next time

472
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,660
and the time after that.

473
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,860
I know

474
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,420
you and Mrs. Wei

475
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,380
are the most important people to Wei Zhi

476
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,980
so I won't give up

477
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,980
on getting your approvals.

478
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,940
Young lad,

479
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,940
I've never been biased

480
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,980
against you.

481
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,860
As a father,

482
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,530
I've never asked

483
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,490
for my daughter's boyfriend

484
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,050
to be rich

485
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,460
but I must see

486
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,660
your sincerity towards her.

487
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,860
You must be responsible

488
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,810
and have the ability

489
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,530
to guarantee her happiness in the future.

490
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,220
Can you do it?

491
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,250
I'll still say the same thing.

492
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,860
No matter

493
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,140
what happens in the future,

494
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,700
I will still prioritize

495
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,660
Zhi's happiness.

496
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,380
Do you understand?

497
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,940
Of course.

498
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,570
This is also what I hope for in my life.

499
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,290
I wonder how Shan Chong

500
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,530
and Dad's chat went.

501
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,530
Zhi,

502
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,220
from the beginning,

503
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,530
as your parents,

504
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,050
we always thought

505
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,240
that Yiming was more suitable for you

506
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,460
in terms of what he could bring

507
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,810
and his family background

508
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,330
compared to Shan Chong.

509
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,460
However, we also know

510
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,220
that marriage is no joke.

511
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,490
Since young,

512
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,860
we arranged

513
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,940
almost everything for you

514
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,290
and you haven't shown any dissatisfaction.

515
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,220
As your parents,

516
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,330
we've gotten used to

517
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,810
helping you

518
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,140
with everything.

519
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,180
We thought

520
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,050
you might still do the same

521
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,810
when it comes to

522
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,700
marriage.

523
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,250
That was why your marriage with Yiming was decided

524
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,700
and why your mother had such a persistent obsession.

525
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,460
I plan to arrange your marriage with Yiming

526
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,730
as soon as possible.

527
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,700
Impossible!

528
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,460
I will never marry Yiming!

529
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,220
However, I now know

530
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,980
that our daughter has grown up

531
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,330
and has her own ideas.

532
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,940
She has found the person

533
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,570
that she wants to be with.

534
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,290
Actually,

535
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,860
what I want

536
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,050
from the beginning

537
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,220
is for my precious daughter

538
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,140
to be happy in the future

539
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,380
and have someone

540
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,860
who loves her more than himself.

541
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,090
After meeting with Shan Chong today,

542
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,250
I believe

543
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,140
I can leave my daughter in his hands

544
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,420
without any worries.

545
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,860
Don't worry.

546
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,220
Speak with your mother.

547
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,570
I will support you.

548
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,380
Dad,

549
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,770
thank you.

550
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm sure

551
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,980
I saved this planet in my previous life

552
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,940
to be so lucky

553
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,010
to become your child.

554
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,460
Mom and Dad,

555
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,290
I love you two.

556
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,090
Happy birthday to you.

557
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,330
Happy birthday to you.

558
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:16,290
- Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to you, my dear wife.

559
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,180
Happy birthday to you.

560
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,380
Dear, happy birthday.

561
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,050
- Thank you. - Mom, happy birthday.

562
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,460
Come and make a wish.

563
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,330
Give it to me.

564
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,770
Mom, this way. Let's eat cake.

565
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,290
Mom, please sit down.

566
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,790
Here's another wish for you.

567
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,640
I hope you can look young and pretty as always

568
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,010
and have no troubles.

569
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,940
I do wish

570
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,250
to have no troubles indeed.

571
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,730
But you cause me

572
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,940
my biggest trouble.

573
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,700
Why do you say that?

574
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,810
I didn't.

575
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,770
Are you sure?

576
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,570
Don't you think I know?

577
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,620
You got together with Shan Chong again.

578
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,810
Enough, Dear.

579
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,810
Today is a happy day.

580
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,810
Let's talk about something happy, all right?

581
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,770
All right, Zhi.

582
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,460
Speak with your mother.

583
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,900
Let me make something good for your mother.

584
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,570
All right?

585
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,980
All right. Be good.

586
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,380
Mom, listen to me.

587
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,620
- I... - Zhi.

588
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,570
I sincerely

589
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,810
hope for your happiness.

590
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,380
I did not want you two

591
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,050
to be together

592
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,900
not because I think Shan Chong wasn't good,

593
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,090
but because I was afraid

594
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,140
that he couldn't provide you

595
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,250
with good living conditions. Do you understand?

596
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,090
If you were to

597
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,570
follow our plans,

598
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,810
you would never

599
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,010
take another wrong step

600
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,810
and suffer in your life.

601
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,620
I know.

602
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,570
Mom,

603
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,380
I understand

604
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,420
your good intentions.

605
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,220
But think about it.

606
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,570
If I live my whole life

607
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,620
under your protection,

608
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,490
my life

609
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,010
will be meaningless.

610
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,300
Zhi,

611
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,520
I don't want

612
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,330
to see you suffer even a little.

613
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,220
I know.

614
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,140
When you were young,

615
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,380
I was busy with work

616
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,900
and didn't accompany you at home.

617
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,050
I didn't give you

618
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,050
the motherly love you deserve.

619
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,330
So, this is also the part

620
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,760
that I feel

621
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,050
most guilty about.

622
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,730
It is also something

623
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,050
that I feel like

624
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,490
making it up to you the most.

625
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,860
Mom,

626
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,620
don't blame yourself.

627
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,700
That wasn't my intention.

628
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,250
If both of you

629
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,660
hadn't worked hard in your career,

630
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,860
you wouldn't create

631
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,460
such a good living environment for me,

632
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,220
right?

633
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,050
But Mom,

634
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,380
I hope you can also believe in me.

635
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,810
My life,

636
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,380
career,

637
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,620
and love.

638
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,380
I hope

639
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,620
I can

640
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,980
resolve all these subjects on my own.

641
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,140
Even if I make the wrong decision,

642
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,730
even if it's a mistake,

643
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,620
I also hope

644
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,660
to experience it

645
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,900
and overcome it myself.

646
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,010
I've been treating you like a child.

647
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,940
So,

648
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,900
we have no chance

649
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,860
to communicate often.

650
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,050
I just realized

651
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,420
that you've grown up.

652
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,220
All right.

653
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,090
I won't be getting overly sentimental.

654
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,490
Since you've decided,

655
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,050
you should go and experience

656
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,460
your own life.

657
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,380
No matter what decisions you make,

658
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,380
I'll support you.

659
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,940
However,

660
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,980
if you do make a mistake,

661
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,420
you can't come to me

662
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,330
while crying.

663
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,860
Thank you, Mom.

664
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:34,860
That's right.

665
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,050
I prepared a gift for you.

666
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,700
Is this me?

667
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,090
Mom,

668
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,570
I know

669
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,770
I seldom come home in the last two years

670
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,900
and see your face

671
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,180
and your eyes directly.

672
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,290
Shan Chong said

673
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,090
we were similar.

674
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,900
We are both occupied

675
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,140
in our own world.

676
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,900
I'm going to stay with my friends.

677
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,700
I'm not staying at home.

678
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,460
Where's your friend?

679
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,860
A local friend in Nancheng!

680
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,140
I've always thought

681
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,620
there's a world in everyone's heart

682
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,220
that is exclusive to them.

683
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,290
It is a place

684
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,140
for what one is passionate about.

685
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,140
I have it. You do too.

686
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,420
Mom,

687
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,620
I believe

688
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,620
you were also an excellent woman with dreams

689
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,290
with something to pursue

690
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,380
who was loved by everyone

691
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,290
before becoming my mother.

692
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,050
You must believe in me too.

693
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,140
I am just like you

694
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,620
in the past.

695
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,420
Ambitious

696
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,090
and full of courage.

697
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,860
I believe I can build my own kingdom

698
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,980
with my own hands.

699
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,620
This path

700
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,090
might be a long one,

701
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,740
that might last for a lifetime.

702
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,050
I think I'm really lucky

703
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,210
because I have both of you

704
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,820
to support me.

705
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,380
Why didn't you make a noise when I called you?

706
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,940
Why are you doing this?

707
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,090
Let me

708
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,300
fulfill your wish today.

709
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,460
Go and pack up. Hurry.

710
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,010
Let's go. Don't you feel excited?

711
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,210
My wish?

712
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,860
Shan,

713
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,490
you were worried that you might trouble others

714
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,980
because of your wheelchair

715
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,050
so we didn't have a chance to play.

716
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,650
Now that you've recovered,

717
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,650
there's nothing to worry about anymore.

718
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,170
You can play as much as you want.

719
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,900
Let's do it!

720
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,530
Shall we?

721
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,460
Let's go.

722
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,740
Slow down.

723
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,860
