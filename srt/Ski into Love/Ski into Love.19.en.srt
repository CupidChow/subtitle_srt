we're going to miss you.

195
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,970
Mr. Zhang,

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,020
take care.

197
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,610
Mr. Zhang.

198
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,020
Mr. Zhang.

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,210
Take care.

200
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,540
Thank you.

201
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,540
Thank you.

202
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,610
Mr. Zhang Yu!

203
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,730
Mr. Zhang.

204
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,600
Mr. Zhang.

205
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,970
- Mr. Zhang. - Mr. Zhang.

206
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,030
Mr. Zhang Yu,

207
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,020
take care of yourself.

208
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,930
I will.

209
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,260
Thank you, everyone.

210
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,140
Thank you.

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,730
What a deep bond.

212
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,090
If you're so reluctant to see him go,

213
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,610
why don't you all

214
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,330
follow Zhang Yu out the door?

215
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,180
Mr. Zhang Yu...

216
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,980
Mr. Zhang,

217
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,020
I'm leaving with you!

218
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,060
Me too!

219
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,260
I'm quitting too!

220
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,440
I've wanted to leave

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,500
this lousy company for ages!

222
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,570
Goodbye!

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,780
Count me in!

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,210
- We quit! - We quit too!

225
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,300
- Let's go. - We're done here!

226
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,090
We've had enough!

227
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,970
Mr. Zhang?

228
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,850
Hello.

229
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,300
What can I do for you?

230
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,060
We're withdrawing

231
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,380
our funding.

232
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,060
No, Mr. Zhang.

233
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,730
We had such a good talk

234
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,570
before!

235
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,140
"Good talk"?

236
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,810
Your company's scandals

237
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,060
are trending on Weibo.

238
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,450
Do you think we'd still work with you?

239
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,570
Listen, Mr. Zhang.

240
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,420
It's

241
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,060
just a small misunderstanding.

242
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,810
So, a "misunderstanding"

243
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,810
made dozens

244
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,570
of artists boycott you

245
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,140
and got millions of netizens slamming you

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,060
to the top of the trending list?

247
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,420
Mr. Wang,

248
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,090
go check Tiger Comics' ratings

249
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,690
on the app store.

250
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,850
Anyway,

251
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,140
we're canceling the deal.

252
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,900
We're out!

253
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,660
No, wait.

254
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,310
Mr. Zhang...

255
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,850
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

256
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,450
I...

257
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,780
Hello, Mr. Li.

258
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,690
Hello,

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,730
Mr. Wang.

260
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,810
How many times have I told you?

261
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm busy!

262
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,300
So,

263
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,810
you're doing this for Mr. Zhang Yu?

264
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,450
He has a family to support.

265
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,780
His entire livelihood comes from that job.

266
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,610
How could I just watch him struggle?

267
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,500
That's true.

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,730
Manman,

269
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,060
I actually

270
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,810
wanted

271
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,140
to ask you something.

272
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,180
Would you be willing

273
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
to redraw the finale of "Farewell Song"?

274
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,260
Of course!

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,750
I've thought about it a million times.

276
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,330
But I don't have a solid idea.

277
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,490
You're the true creator of "Farewell Song."

278
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
If it were up to you,

279
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,810
would you want the heroine

280
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,660
to remain

281
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,000
a noble princess?

282
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,930
No.

283
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,420
Why not?

284
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,580
A princess

285
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,960
may have status

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,020
and security,

287
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,180
but she's

288
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,380
just like

289
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,670
a caged canary,

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,060
trapped and restricted.

291
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,730
The outside world

292
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,250
is full of risks,

293
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,260
and she might even struggle to make a living.

294
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,770
But for her,

295
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,690
every day would be a new beginning,

296
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,720
and that's true freedom.

297
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,260
That makes sense.

298
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,810
If it were me,

299
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,360
I think I'd still want to return

300
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,500
to the palace.

301
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,810
But for the heroine,

302
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,780
there's no doubt

303
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,980
the outside world

304
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,170
is where she's truly free.

305
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,180
Right?

306
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,090
How could a bird

307
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,570
that has seen the endless blue sky

308
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,730
and the vast open sea

309
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,320
willingly return to her cage?

310
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,210
So,

311
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,930
this is the path she must take.

312
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,810
Exactly.

313
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,500
Manman,

314
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,660
does this mean

315
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,380
you're willing

316
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,420
to work with me again?

317
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,540
That's amazing!

318
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,520
Once we finish

319
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,460
"Farewell Song" together,

320
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,930
I'll help you with whatever new project

321
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,140
you're starting.

322
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,090
Really?

323
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,070
Cheers.

324
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,730
Bottoms up!

325
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,020
Cheers!

326
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,610
I'm heading back to Nancheng.

327
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,420
What for?

328
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,570
The ski season isn't over yet.

329
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,500
Is your pass expiring?

330
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,380
Getting a job there.

331
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,090
What job?

332
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,380
No more snowboarding?

333
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,690
Hanging up your board?

334
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,570
You're done?

335
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,970
Snowboarding is not for me.

336
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,060
Come on.

337
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,380
Snowboarding is amazing,

338
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,060
and coaching pays well.

339
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,260
Come on.

340
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,330
Say something.

341
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,180
Let's hear him out first.

342
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,180
I've been thinking about this for a while.

343
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,180
I just never found the right time to tell you.

344
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,420
As you all know,

345
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,210
I'm from Nancheng,

346
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,900
and it never even snows there.

347
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,140
I never imagined

348
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,610
I'd get into snowboarding

349
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,610
trying to lose weight.

350
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,130
You might not believe this,

351
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,130
but I'd always been chubby.

352
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,090
I was so ordinary

353
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,260
and unnoticeable

354
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,650
that the girl

355
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,780
I'd liked for years

356
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,130
saw me dozens of times

357
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,780
but still never even remembered my name.

358
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,740
So I started

359
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,090
working on losing weight.

360
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,980
I tried

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,220
every possible method in school.

362
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,780
Then one day,

363
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,500
I read online

364
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,500
that snowboarding for an hour burns

365
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,140
as many calories as a nine-kilometer run.

366
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,940
I did the math,

367
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,300
and it seemed

368
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,980
like a great deal.

369
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,170
So I came to Beishan.

370
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,260
And before I knew it,

371
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,170
I was hooked.

372
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,410
Every time I nailed a trick,

373
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,690
like a clean flip

374
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,220
or a solid Ollie,

375
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,410
it gave me

376
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,500
this illusion

377
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,740
that maybe

378
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,890
I wasn't so ordinary after all.

379
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,060
Snowboarding did spark

380
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,740
a dream in me.

381
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,700
I told my family,

382
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,370
"Give me a few years.

383
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,130
Let me chase my dream."

384
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,090
But eventually,

385
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,650
I realized that dreams are dreams

386
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,170
because not everyone

387
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,260
has the talent

388
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,980
or luck to make them come true.

389

Still, I'm grateful

390
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,300
I met you all here in Beishan.

391
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,780
Thank you, everyone.

392
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,060
You're making it sound

393
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,650
like we're never going to meet again.

394
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,130
No matter what you do,

395
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,370

396
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,410
You're anything but ordinary, Yan.

397
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,330
Right.

Alright.

406
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,130
When you become a white-collar worker in Nancheng,

407
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,260
drowning in overtime,

408
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,740

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,780
every last drop in this place!

421
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,700
You said it.

Deal!

423
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,650
I'm downing this one.

424
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,220
Me too.

425
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,220
My ride's here.

426
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,980
Time to go.

427
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,370
I'll walk you out.

428
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,300
Don't.

429
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,500
Don't say anything.

430
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,250
If you do, I'll start crying,

431
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,080
and that won't look good.

432
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,500
Alright.

433
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,810
Text me when you land.

434
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,780
Will do.

Take care of yourself, Yan.

436
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,370
And don't forget to chat

437
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,050
in the group even after you start work.

438
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,500
Of course. I'm not leaving the group.

439
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,650
No hugs!

440
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,370
Fine. Take care of yourself.

And don't forget to visit us.

Got it?

I'll come back to visit you.

What are you, a husky?

445
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,810
Your owner just said

446
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,540
he'd come back to visit.

Alright, I'm off.

Bye!

452
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:43,920
Shan,

453
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,240
I feel like the colors here

454
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,450
could be a bit lighter.

455
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,980
What do you think?

456
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,240
Yeah, this part

457
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,130
feels off.

458
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,740
I want to tweak it.

Here I come.

463
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,500
- What do you think, Shan? - I think...

464
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,220
Honestly,

465
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,090
it looks fine to me.

466
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,850
I think blue looks better.

467

00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,250
"Zhao Keyan"?

775
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,490
Why does he have the same name

776
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,250
as my dog?

777
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,140
Miss Jiang,

778
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,530
your dog has

779
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,660
a really unique name.

780
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,080
I didn't name him.

781
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,220
When I adopted him in college,

782
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,250
he was already named Zhao Keyan.

783
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,000
I've just

784
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,180
kept calling him that all these years.

785
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,420
"Experience:

786
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,980
Officer of External Relations in Student Council,

787
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,700
President of Animal Rescue Society."

788
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,170
I was the head

789
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,610
of External Relations back in college.

790
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,690
"Snowboard coach at Beishan Ski Resort"?

791
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,420
Yan?

792
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,820
I'm ordering takeout.

793
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,460
Do you want anything?

794
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,560
Sure,

795
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,650
as long as it's not too expensive.

796
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,340
Got it.

797
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,820
Hello?

798
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,940
Hello,

799
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,220
is this Mr. Zhao Keyan?

800
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,100
Yes.

801
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,690
Who's calling?

802
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,210
I'm from Human Resources

803
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,960
at Mengxizhou.

804
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,970
You applied

805
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,210
for our marketing position,

806
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,090
and your resume

807
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,980
has passed the initial screening.

808
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,530
Are you available

809
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,610
for an interview

810
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,420
tomorrow at 9 AM?

811
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,500
Yes, absolutely!

812
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,060
Great.

813
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,860
I'll send you

814
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,980
the address shortly.

815
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,650
Our boss will personally

816
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,900
conduct your interview tomorrow.

817
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,860
Please be punctual.

818
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,130
Don't worry. I'll definitely be on time.

819
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,940
Thank you!

820
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,900
I have an interview.

821
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,340
Alright, everyone.

822
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,380
Please fill out these forms.

823
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,250
Thank you.

824
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,060
Miss Jiang.

825
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,900
You guys carry on.

826
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,690
I'm heading over there.

827
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,570
Alright, Miss Jiang.

828
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,250
Hey, quick question.

829
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,060
Was that your superior?

830
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,730
You mean Miss Jiang?

831
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,380
She's our boss.

832
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,250
Cool,

833
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,060
right?

834
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,820
Boss?

835
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,650
Yeah.

836
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,730
Impressive, huh?

837
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,690
Everyone here

838
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,460
looks up

839
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,540
to her.

840
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,690
She started

841
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,650
this business in college.

842
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,770
Oh,

843
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,570
she's your

844
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,690
alumna too.

845
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,250
It is pretty impressive.

846
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,980
Finish up the forms.

847
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,340
I'll collect them later.

848
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,590
[Senior]

849
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,210
Good luck.

850
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,210
I'll leave you to it.

851
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,770
Zhao,

852
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,290
review the forms

853
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,680
and prepare a report

854
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,380
for Miss Jiang.

855
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,060
Got it.

856
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,500
A new hire joined today.

857
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,690
He's quite cute.

858
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,610
Jiang Nanfeng, you're hopeless.

859
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,420
Keep this up,

860
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,820
and I'll sign you up for self-restraint training.

861
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,540
You know him too.

862
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,340
Hint:

863
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,900
He's a cold fish.

864
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,170
Have we

865
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,460
met before?

866
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,170
Wow,

867
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,940
is this a new pickup line?

868
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,860
Xicheng and Beishan.

869
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,500
Ring a bell?

870
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,370
No,

871
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,770
I mean

872
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,770
before that.

873
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,500
Oh?

874
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,210
I don't think so.

875
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,650
We're alumni.

876
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,020
We must've crossed paths.

877
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,650
I barely went out

878
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,290
in college,

879
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,460
so probably not.

880
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,770
Really?

881
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,500
Then Zhao Keyan...

882
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:58,980
Excuse me.

883
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,650
Here are your drinks.

884
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,420
- Thanks. - Thanks.

885
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,460
I'll take the pineapple.

886
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,980
You're allergic.

887
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,060
How do you

888
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,060
know that?

889
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,500
You'll play...

890
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,090
Can you fake a love confession?

891
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,690
Play a guy harassing me.

892
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,460
Love confession?

893
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,250
So he can protect me.

894
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:28,820
Okay?

895
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,690
I can't eat this.

896
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,540
I'm allergic.

897
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,250
What's wrong?

898
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,770
Nothing.

899
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,570
Miss,

900
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,090
I really like you!

901
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,900
I told you

902
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,380
I'm not interested.

903
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,380
Can you stop bothering me?

904
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,770
It's all

905
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,690
coming back now.

906
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,210
So you've known who I was all along?

907
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,250
Why didn't you say anything?

908
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,420
Say what?

909
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,750
That you deleted

910
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,610
my WeChat in college?

911
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,610
That'd be awkward, right?

912
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,900
Fair point.

913
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,500
How about

914
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,610
we just pretend I never remembered?

915
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,820
Whether you remember or not doesn't matter.

916
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,820
It's all in the past now.

917
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,380
Either way, I'm the one who got embarrassed.

918
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,340
No, wait.

919
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,290
Yan...

920
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,690
Zhao Keyan,

921
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,380
you know

922
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,170
how I am.

923
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,860
I mess up all the time.

924
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,690
It's only natural

925
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,730
that it backfires sometimes.

926
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,170
But this time,

927
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,130
I really

928
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,500
don't know how

929
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,090
to face it

930
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:51,980
or face you.

931
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,460
It's not that complicated.

932
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,570
If my presence at work

933
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,610
makes you uncomfortable,

934
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,820
I can just resign.

935
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,130
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

936
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,290
I keep work

937
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,570
and personal matters separate.

938
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,500
If you do well,

939
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,610
I'll even give you a raise.

940
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,610
Alright.

941
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,420
Here's

942
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,690
to Miss Jiang,

943
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,980
the professional.

944
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,940
Cheers.

945
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,650
Cheers.

946
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,460
What?

947
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,860
Zhao Keyan is Yan,

948
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,290
and Yan is Zhao Keyan?

949
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,690
Yan used to be chubby,

950
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,090
and you two met before?

951
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,210
Oh my...

952
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,940
That's way too much information.

953
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,250
I can't process this.

954
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,570
Looking back,

955
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,170
I really was a menace

956
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,650
when I was younger.

957
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,900
A huge menace.

958
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,800
Girl,

959
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,290
you always call me face-blind,

960
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,650
but I think you're way worse.

961
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,570
You're face-blind and heartless!

962
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,770
Alright,

963
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,820
enough.

964
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,380
I'm already regretting it.

965
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,250
So what's your plan now?

966
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,570
I've already

967
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,980
hurt him twice.

968
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,380
I should at least

969
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,690
try to make it up to him.

970
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,940
Make it up to him?

971
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,460
You're not planning

972
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,980
to offer yourself as compensation

973
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,820
and hurt him a third time, are you?

974
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,730
Where do you even learn these terms?

975
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,090
Do I seem like that kind of person?

976
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,820
You could be.

977
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,980
What if

978
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,130
you end up hurting him a third time?

979
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,020
I'll try not to.

980
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,980
But honestly,

981
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,340
I've never treated anyone else like this before.

982
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,210
Alright...

983
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,340
Cheer up.

984
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,900
You've

985
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,860
been through

986
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,900
way worse.

987
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,570
You'll be fine.

988
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,570
Alright,

989
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,460
cheer up.

990
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,060
I'm off for my midnight snack.

991
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:55,860
Bye-bye.

992
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,020
- Love you. - Let's chat on WeChat.

993
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm back.

994
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,380
First day and you're already working overtime?

995
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,610
Is it that intense?

996
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,130
Nah,

997
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,420
I just had dinner with the boss.

998
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,690
Then why the long face?

999
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,690
Did they make you drink?

1000
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,380
I've heard

1001
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,250
that ad agencies

1002
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,170
love hiring

1003
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,980
pretty boys and girls

1004
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,210
to entertain clients.

1005
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,900
You've got a natural advantage.

1006
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,860
Remember Jiang Nanfeng,

1007
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,770
the one I told you about?

1008
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,610
The senior

1009
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,820
you used to talk about all the time?

1010
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,690
She owns the company

1011
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,540
I joined today.

1012
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,020
Your senior is your boss?

1013
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,460
Do you think

1014
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,210
I should quit?

1015
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,090
What?

1016
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,940
You're walking away from free success?

1017
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,650
It just feels weird,

1018
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,460
like I'm taking advantage of her.

1019
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,090
That's classic

1020
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,210
male ego.

1021
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,770
It does you no good.

1022
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,380
You need this job, right?

1023
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,900
Work is work.

1024
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,420
Just focus on doing it well.

1025
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,340
Fine.

1026
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,820
I'll go change.

1027
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,540
[Ding ding ding]
Welcome to today's showdown!

1028
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,420
Today, it's Wei Zhi going up

1029
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,340
against Wang Laohu!

1030
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,690
You already lost to me once.

1031
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,380
How dare you challenge me again?

1032
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,610
Aren't you afraid of another beatdown?

1033
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,730
Time changes everything!

1034
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,540
I've conquered mountains.

1035
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,290
I'm a whole new person now!

1036
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,580
[P.S. What she means by conquering mountains]

1037
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,860
Three, two, one.

1038
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,770
Fight!

1039
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,210
"Ski into Love" is the best!

1040
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,940
A powerful strike

1041
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,460
from the once-legendary artist!

1042
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,250
But Wang Laohu won't go down easily!

1043
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,380
You think that's enough to beat me?

1044
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,540
Take this!

1045
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,650
Army of trolls!

1046
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,420
It's followed by a "Banned Account" punch!

1047
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,210
But it doesn't seem

1048
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,170
to faze Wei Zhi.

1049
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,210
She's blocked

1050
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,860
every hit!

1051
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,900
She is smiling!

1052
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,730
Never underestimate me.

1053
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,980
I'm not fighting alone.

1054
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,090
I have many allies!

1055
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,420
Guys, give me strength!

1056
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,540
- Evidence! - Lawyers! - Support!

1057
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,500
Wang Laohu is down for the count!

1058
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,460
Wei Zhi, any final words?

1059
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,610
I hope the law takes him down for good!
