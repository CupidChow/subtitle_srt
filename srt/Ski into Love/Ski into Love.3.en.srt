00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,250
Round two!

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,890
Athletes, swap lanes!

194
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,340
Remember to go all out.

195
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,890
You are the one who should go all out.

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,340
Red Lane, get ready!

197
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,890
Blue Lane, get ready!

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,850
Attention!

199
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,420
Go!

200
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:17,300
[Dangerous Stunts. Do not attempt]

201
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,300
I told you so.

202
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,530
Master will make a comeback.

203
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,130
I told you so!

204
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,370
Do your best, Chong!

205
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,370
Do your best!

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,820
Is he all right?

207
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,130
I know you are fine.

208
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,370
Stop pretending to be dead.

209
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,770
Get up.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,220
Is he all right?

211
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,250
Master won!

212
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,220
We've won!

213
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,220
Master!

214
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,460
You are the greatest!

215
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,180
I told you so!

216
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,820
Chong!

217
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,460
Coming!

218
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,770
What's wrong with you?

219
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,060
You opened the door without asking who it was.

220
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,010
What if it was a bad guy?

221
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,890
No one else

222
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,890
knocks on the door as violently as you.

223
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,730
Come here.

224
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,700
Let me show you something.

225
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,460
What is it?

226
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,490
Something good.

227
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,370
I sent you a text

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,340
but you didn't reply.

229
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,650
You didn't watch

230
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,460
this interesting match.

231
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,060
Who was that?

232
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,770
What do you think?

233
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,060
Isn't he great?

234
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,530
Doesn't he look cool?

235
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,770
Yes.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,770
Look closely.

237
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,100
The Pro?

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,820
Yes.

239
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,220
Isn't the one in blue

240
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,010
Mr. Glasses Cloth

241
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,180
whom I've been searching for?

242
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,770
Yes.

243
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,370
Look closely.

244
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,530
Also.

245
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,610
The person in purple

246
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,730
also looks handsome.

247
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,420
You went to Beishan for no reason.

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,700
Did you miss my brother?

249
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,340
Why would I miss him?

250
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,490
It's fine if you miss him.

251
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm magnanimous.

252
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,850
I'll reluctantly

253
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,940
allow you to miss him a while.

254
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,100
Seriously.

255
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,250
You finally

256
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,700
met my brother.

257
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,130
Couldn't you

258
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,530
talk things out?

259
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm not his friend.

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,220
Anyone can be his friend if they want

261
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,940
but I'm not one of them.

262
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,890
If you aren't his friend,

263
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,130
why did you go and find him at Beishan?

264
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,220
I came to Beishan

265
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,010
to see

266
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,100
what he looks like now.

267
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,250
Turns out he is still the same.

268
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,340
Shan.

269
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,530
Do you know?

270
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,100
Your brother hasn't changed at all.

271
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,820
He is still Shan Chong from before.

272
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,770
So?

273
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,370
I don't understand

274
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,370
why he would retire.

275
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,580
Why wouldn't he come back?

276
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,770
All right.

277
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,100
It'll be fine.

278
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,100
It's all in the past.

279
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,730
Where are you now?

280
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,820
The games hall.

281
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,130
I was playing games.

282
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,530
Shan, come and eat.

283
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,730
I'm hanging up.

284
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,420
My mother is calling me.

285
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,300
All right.

286
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,850
Go. Eat more.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,370
Eat more.

288
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:18,980
All right.

289
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,220
- Bye. - Bye.

290
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,650
You are amazing.

291
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,700
You slept

292
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,100
until half past two in the afternoon.

293
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,300
I've asked for a day off

294
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,530
from Master.

295
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,850
Good morning.

296
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,890
What's wrong?

297
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,300
Are you still sleeping?

298
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,850
Besides sleeping,

299
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,060
I can still do something else, all right?

300
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,700
Well,

301
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,610
Yan

302
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,340
sent a video

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,420
of your match to me yesterday.

304
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,730
So, I showed it to Wei Zhi.

305
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,180
Her heart

306
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,490
was fluttering immediately.

307
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,610
Why?

308
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,890
It was probably because

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,730
she recognized

310
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,940
the one in blue

311
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,220
to be the Mr. Glasses Cloth

312
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,370
she has admired for a long time.

313
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,460
After that,

314
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,530
she realized the person beside him

315
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,530
was also tall and handsome.

316
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,370
Is this my apology gift?

317
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,730
No.

318
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,850
Where's my gift?

319
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,180
We'll decide it on another day.

320
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,610
Which day is it?

321
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,100
The day

322
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,250
when you

323
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,060
treat your gaze.

324
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,220
You are the one who has a bad gaze.

325
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,580
Let's go.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,730
Master,

327
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,530
it's really snowing.

328
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,460
It's so pretty.

329
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,250
What are you doing?

330
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,100
Don't turn it off.

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Keep watching.

332
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,420
Master,

333
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,580
I...

334
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,700
Keep watching your video.

335
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,820
Anyway.

336
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,980
Why are you so fierce?

337
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,180
I can't meet him in person anyway.

338
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,220
How do you not even

339
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,100
get his contact?

340
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,220
You're so useless.

341
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,580
It's useless even if I get his contact.

342
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,610
He will never like me.

343
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,700
How do you know

344
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,700
that he won't like you?

345
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,980
Let's go.

346
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,330
Why do you push me so hard?

347
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,290
It took me a long time to make my hair.

348
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,420
Look out.

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,300
♪Secrets keeping in breeze when♪

What... What do you mean?

354
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,460
Master,

355
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,570
do you know Mr. Glasses Cloth?

356
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,900
Then...

357
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,180
Can you...

358
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,090
Bring your board.

359
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,300
♪Exists because of you♪

360
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,810
It's so heavy.

361
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,420
That's right, Master.

362
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,380
When are you giving me

363
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,490
my apology gift?

364
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,290
I will consider it.

365
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,980
Are you going to break your promise?

366
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,050
It's snowing heavily.

367
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,090
Are we going snowboarding

368
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,180
on a romantic snowy day?

369
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,330
Let's go. Be careful.

370
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,290
Breaking news.

371
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,380
I think my master

372
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,250
knows Mr. Glasses Cloth.

373
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,050
Did he tell you that?

374
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,250
I got the information out of him.

375
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,090
I wanted to ask him

376
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,330
to help introduce me.

377
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,980
Is he willing to do that?

378
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,140
Of course, not.

379
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,330
His own student

380
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,980
having another idol.

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,420
It's more or less embarrassing.

382
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,860
Let's go.

383
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,620
Here it is.

384
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,730
What are you doing, Zhi?

385
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,220
Next.

386
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,010
Okay.

387
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,940
Zhi,

388
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,090
what are you doing?

389
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,940
These cola bottles are so heavy

390
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,940
but you still bring them out.

391
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,620
Because it's fun.

392
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,250
What are you doing?

393
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,140
Digging a hole.

394
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,490
Burying the cola.

395
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,770
You'll understand tomorrow.

396
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,810
All right.

397
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:44,980
Master,

398
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,980
are you all right?

399
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,420
It hurts.

400
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,570
Master.

401
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,810
Let me give you a cold compress.

402
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,700
It's so cold.

403
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,620
Shouldn't it be a hot compress?

404
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,860
It doesn't hurt after a while.

405
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,700
Master.

406
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,250
Are you all right?

407
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,810
Should we

408
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,730
go to the infirmary?

409
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,460
The infirmary? Sure.

410
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,620
No need. I'm fine.

411
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,900
Continue.

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,460
Quick, bury them.

413
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,140
That's good enough.

414
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,090
It's hard over here.

415
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,700
Help us record a video.

416
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,460
Sure.

417
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,940
Get him to help us record a video.

418
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,010
Come on.

419
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,090
Make us

420
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,980
look good in the video.

421
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,140
No problem.

422
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,140
Let's begin.

423
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,180
Look at the camera.

424
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:17,980
All right.

425
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,490
Come on.

426
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:18,940
Slushie.

427
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,330
Let's begin.

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,980
Slushie.

429
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,570
Making a slushie challenge.

430
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,860
It's all frozen on the side.

431
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,810
It's so hard.

432
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,620
Zhi.

433
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,460
Look.

434
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,140
Your Master

435
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,050
is standing behind you

436
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,460
without helping you.

437
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,900
Perhaps he was stunned by the knock.

438
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,010
Let's not give him

439
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,810
the cola tomorrow.

440
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,290
Master!

441
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,700
They said you were stunned

442
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,490
and wouldn't help them.

443
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,620
They won't let you drink the cola tomorrow.

444
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,620
Jiang Nanfeng!

445
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,490
I told you

446
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,530
not to talk bad about Master!

447
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,490
Wei Zhi.

448
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,460
Both of you make me so angry.

449
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,220
I want to drink.

450
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,490
Master.

451
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,860
How do we go to the bottom

452
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,900
without the cable car?

453
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,420
We'll ski down.

454
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,570
Ski down?

455
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,090
How far is it?

456
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,050
About 6,000 to 7,000 meters.

457
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,460
I can't do it.

458
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,730
What's wrong?

459
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,770
It's stuck in my throat.

460
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,660
Drink mine.

461
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,420
You're so considerate.

462
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,220
Will you do this

463
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,090
with other girls?

464
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,570
Yan,

465
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,940
do you treat every girl the same?

466
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,330
What a weird expression.

467
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,050
I think he does.

468
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,490
Let me answer this.

469
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,490
Shan.

470
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,620
Chong, what are you doing?

471
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,330
What's wrong?

472
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,530
Are you in a bad mood?

473
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,660
I think

474
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,700
there's something wrong with Miss Zhai.

475
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,770
The style

476
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,420
of her comics has become weird.

477
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,290
I don't know

478
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,220
what's wrong with her.

479
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,700
What are you doing?

480
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,380
She should be

481
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,980
doing well.

482
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,180
What's wrong?

483
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,180
Right. Why am I telling you this?

484
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,860
You don't know

485
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,530
about comics.

486
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,620
That's right.

487
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,380
I heard

488
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,660
you won against Dai Duo yesterday

489
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,810
and stole his goggles.

490
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,530
I didn't steal.

491
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,810
That was my prize.

492
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,700
Then...

493
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,980
That's all.

494
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,810
Hold on.

495
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,090
Did you call me because of this?

496
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,980
No.

497
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,250
You always blame the innocent.

498
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,730
That's all. I'm hanging up.

499
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,090
Hey, Chong.

500
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,220
Well...

501
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,010
You shouldn't bully Dai Duo

502
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,180
so harshly.

503
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,530
You should ask him

504
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,810
not to complain to others all the time.

505
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,900
Isn't it embarrassing?

506
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,180
He didn't complain to anyone.

507
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,090
I just mentioned it simply.

508
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,090
Don't go

509
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,140
and trouble him later.

510
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,660
Understand?

511
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,620
I understand.

512
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,420
I'm hanging up.

513
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,570
He hangs up so quickly.

514
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,530
The slopes are so pretty tonight.

515
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,980
What do you think?

516
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,330
I'll let you experience the beauty of the slopes at night.

517
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,090
Sure.

518
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,660
Let's go.

519
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,140
Let's go.

520
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,140
Master, have a nice chat with her.

521
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,460
Let's go.

522
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,050
If we don't leave,

523
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,290
we won't catch the end of the national news.

524
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,620
Master,

525
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,770
are you allergic to being romantic?

526
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,090
Can't you learn from Yan?

527
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,980
Didn't you say

528
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,010
he treats every girl the same?

529
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,660
Even so,

530
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,620
he still treats every girl romantically.

531
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,420
Master, stop.

532
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,250
What's wrong?

533
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,420
Let me take some pictures for my materials.

534
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,330
I think

535
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,380
there's something wrong with Miss Zhai.

536
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,380
The style

537
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,980
of her comics has become weird.

538
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,490
Why are you sitting down as well?

539
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,140
You said

540
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,700
you wanted to draw a skiing genre comic.

541
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,460
Yes.

542
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,380
Why?

543
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,290
Because

544
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,770
when I was

545
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,250
at my lowest,

546
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,380
I watched a video.

547
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,900
It was the video I told you

548
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,770
about a match of Mr. Glasses Cloth.

549
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,290
The video

550
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,730
captured my heart.

551
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,530
It said

552
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,050
he was persistent and passionate.

553
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,620
We must never give up.

554
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,220
I really like to draw comics.

555
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,940
However,

556
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,730
something happened previously

557
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,050
so I can't draw

558
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,660
the subject I'm good at anymore.

559
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,730
What happened?

560
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,250
It's a long story

561
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,220
but it's nothing much.

562
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,290
It's already in the past.

563
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,620
What were you drawing

564
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,700
in the past?

565
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,290
Ancient style comics.

566
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,290
Have you heard about it?

567
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,090
It's about a young girl

568
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,860
living a lavish life.

569
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,530
Suddenly,

570
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,090
she received the power of an evil dragon.

571
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,770
So,

572
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,090
she started growing scales

573
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,250
and horns grew on her head.

574
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,180
Forget it.

575
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,980
It seems like

576
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,460
you are not interested.

577
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,050
No.

578
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,980
I think it's quite special.

579
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,290
What next?

580
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,420
Next,

581
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,530
her parents

582
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,660
found out.

583
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,730
Her parents

584
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,770
didn't want their daughter

585
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,660
to become a misfit

586
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,380
so they confined her.

587
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,050
However, she escaped

588
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,490
and started an adventure.

589
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,330
What you told me

590
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,530
was your experience, right?

591
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,330
Actually, I'm a little worried

592
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,660
that I can't draw the skiing genre well.

593
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,980
Didn't you say

594
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,530
you wanted to protect your dream?

595
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,490
What?

596
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,180
Do you lack confidence now?

597
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,420
No.

598
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,660
I'm looking at my current progress.

599
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,860
However,

600
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,380
now that I have you to teach me,

601
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,050
I think it should be fine

602
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,810
if we can

603
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,900
practice

604
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,980
a few more days seriously.

605
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,420
Moreover, I realize

606
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,180
I've started

607
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,490
to like skiing

608
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,530
recently

609
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,700
even though I kept falling.

610
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,570
Master,

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,490
thank you.

612
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,940
You are one of the reasons

613
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,330
for making me like skiing.

614
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,530
I think

615
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,330
there is still a difference

616
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,250
between skiing

617
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,220
and drawing comics.

618
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,290
In skiing,

619
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,700
if you work hard every day,

620
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,050
you will improve slowly.

621
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,420
The sense of achievement

622
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,140
is in your own hands.

623
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,980
However, drawing is different.

624
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,490
When I draw, I'll have to

625
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,660
stay inside a small room alone.

626
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,620
Although I'll feel a sense of achievement

627
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,980
when I completed my work,

628
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,570
most of my sense of achievement

629
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,900
comes from my readers.

630
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,730
If they praise my work,

631
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,490
I'll be very happy.

632
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,860
If the readers

633
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,050
don't like my work

634
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,860
and complains about me,

635
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,050
I'll feel sad.

636
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,900
Indeed.

637
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,010
Skiing is a sport

638
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,530
where

639
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,980
your biggest enemy is yourself.

640
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,570
When you stand on a slope

641
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,660
and on the starting line,

642
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,090
you will realize

643
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,180
that you are competing against yourself.

644
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,050
You can only choose to stop progressing.

645
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,010
Otherwise,

646
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,090
there's no end

647
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,380
to this path.

648
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,380
Why did you stop?

649
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,330
Because you wanted to take pictures

650
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,050
and said you liked skiing.

651
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,770
You always carry a tortoise

652
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,490
and slack whenever you get a chance.

653
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,290
Don't underestimate me!

654
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,180
Although I'm slow

655
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,730
and stupid sometimes,

656
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,660
I will one day

657
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,180
climb up

658
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,660
to the highest spot

659
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,290
like my tortoise.

660
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,980
When you're at the highest point,

661
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,090
you can reach for the stars.

662
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,090
As promised.

663
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,420
Your apology gift.

664
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,460
No way.

665
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,860
No way.

666
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,290
Mr. Glasses Cloth is Master?

667
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,380
Master is Mr. Glasses Cloth?

668
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,770
I'm so embarrassed.

669
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,290
Just let me die.

670
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,290
What's wrong?

671
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,570
Just now,

672
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,220
I think I realized the truth of the world.

673
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,330
It wasn't on purpose.

674
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,940
I didn't recognize you.

675
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,730
You didn't recognize me?

676
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,250
All of you

677
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,730
were always wearing masks

678
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,420
and goggles.

679
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,620
Yes.

680
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,730
It's because you...

681
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,570
It's because all of you

682
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,010
were always wearing masks and goggles

683
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,530
so I couldn't recognize you.

684
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,770
Otherwise, I would've recognized you.

685
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,090
It's all your fault.

686
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,220
It's not my fault.

687
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,460
I gave you a hint.

688
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,620
What hint?

689
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,180
The hint is

690
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,220
look at my eyes.

691
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,730

Yan and Jiang Nanfeng already found out.

695
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,810
They knew?

696
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,770
What do you think?

697
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,770
Why didn't they tell me?

698
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,010
All of you knew

699
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,490
but you were looking at me like a laughing stock.

700
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,660
Don't you have a mouth

702
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,770
Why wouldn't you tell me?

703
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,940
How do I say that?

704
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,050
You like him.

705
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,810
You want his contact.

706
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,730
No.

You can say...

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,810
Just say...

710
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,380
I said it.

711
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,220
I told you before.

712
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,770
How do you know

713
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,660
that he doesn't like you?

I'm still here.

I'm here to check on my cabbage.

732
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,050
A new pair of goggles?

733
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,900
It's pink.

734
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,980
Stop.

735
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,290
Let me help you get it.

736
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,620
The rentals won't work anymore.

737
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,490
I'll drive tomorrow

738
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,660
and take you to buy a new pair.

739
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,700
Really?

740
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,660
Thank you, Master.

741
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,490
See you tomorrow.

742
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,330
See you tomorrow.

743
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,330
Why is it torn?

744
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,860
It's in bad shape.

745
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,460
Gosh.

746
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,140
It's fine.

747
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,700
Bring it back

748
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,730
and get the hotel to mend it.

749
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,770
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

750
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,860
What are you doing?

751
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,980
Help me take a look.

752
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,650
Should I sew it again?

753
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,740
I must still be sleeping.

754
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,340
I'm still sleeping.

755
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,420
Chong,

756
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,860
you look

757
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,780
like my mother now.

758
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:00,980
Wait.

759
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,900
Why are you

760
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,210
sewing the tortoise yourself?

761
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,610
Do you really have feelings for her?

762
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,010
She's just a tourist.

763
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,340
She will leave after two days.

764
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,940
A tourist?

765
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,860
I don't see you

766
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,090
treating the previous tourists so well.

767
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,530
You are even

768
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,740
helping her sew the tortoise.

769
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,130
No other tourists

770
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,340
broke the tortoise.

771
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,170
Hello.

772
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,940
Hello.

773
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,610
Hello.

774
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,610
Please help me get

775
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,740
a parcel for Nancheng Sun.

776
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,130
Thanks.

777
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,260
Sure. Please wait.

778
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,010
Tell me.

779
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,610
The snow goggles are so expensive.

780
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,090
Why don't I return it to him?

781
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,860
No need.

782
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,050
Yan said

783
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,090
Shan Chong is an instructor

784
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,690
hired specifically by the ski resort.

785
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,690
Even the coaches of the resort

786
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,940
take lessons from him.

787
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,340
Do you think someone like him

788
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,780
will need this pair of goggles?

789
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,050
Keep it for yourself.

790
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,130
[Mom]
Thank you.

791
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,740
Go upstairs.

792
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,530
Let me answer the call.

793
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,340
I'll be leaving first.

794
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,900
Hello, Mom.

795
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,780
Where are you?

796
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,490
I'm home.

797
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,780
You're home?

798
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,050
Why is it so noisy?

799
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,570
I'm watching the television.

800
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,010
Watching the television?

801
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,050
What television?

802
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,940
Your father

803
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,740
just came from your restaurant.

804
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,980
What are you watching?

805
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,420
It's like this, Mom.

806
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,420
Actually,

807
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,090
I came out to play with my friends.

808
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,170
However, I'm worried

809
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,380
that you might say that I'm fooling around

810
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,050
so I dared not tell you.

811
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,420
Fooling around?

812
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,740
Nothing beats drawing comics

813
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,260
when it comes to fooling around.

814
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm asking you.

815
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,650
When are you coming back?

816
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,650
Next week.

817
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,610
I'm coming back next week.

818
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,690
You must come home next week.

819
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,690
I'm telling you.

820
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,820
Mr. Jiang's son

821
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,900
is coming back the day after tomorrow.

822
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,570
We agreed

823
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,900
for both families to have dinner together.

824
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,740
Hello.

825
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,740
Mom...

826
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,050
Mom...

827
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,940
The signal...

828
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,010
Mom...

829
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,650
Hello.

830
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,460
Hey!

831
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,820
Look.

832
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,130
Zhi's comic

833
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,490
is not bad.

834
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,490
It's very vivid.

835
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,740
What's the use of drawing well?

836
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,820
Can she make a living with that?

837
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,650
Seriously, Jiang Yiming.

838
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,010
He just has to come back

839
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,130
at a time like this.

840
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,300
Please confirm it.

841
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,690
The sun is so...

842
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,650
So handsome.

843
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,130
Really.

844
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,860
I want

845
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,530
a boyfriend like him.

846
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,650
What about

847
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,380
Beishan's Yan?

848
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,260
No.

849
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,570
Master.

850
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,300
Good morning.

851
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,530
Did you steal a chicken this morning?

852
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,490
Why are you so happy?

853
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,170
No.

854
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,820
My little tortoise.

855
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,380
That's right, Master.

856
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,170
Thank you for giving me a pair of new goggles.

857
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,940
It looks very expensive.

858
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,570
Why don't I pay you back?

859
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,090
The price doesn't matter.

860
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,690
It's for you.

861
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,860
Chong, good morning.

862
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,260
Good morning, Zhi.

863
00:37:59,480 --> 00:37:59,980
Good morning.

864
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,420
Good morning.

865
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,050
You got the tortoise.

866
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,490
Do you know?

867
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,490
Chong

868
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,460
spent all night

869
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,170
sewing the tortoise

870
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,300
for you.

871
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,380
Zhi,

872
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,050
Master

873
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,690
gave you new goggles

874
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,300
and sew the tortoise for you.

875
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,130
Compared to

876
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,820
Mr. Glasses Cloth,

877
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,980
don't you think Master

878
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,210
is better?

879
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,170
They are just as good.

880
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,530
They are just as good.

881
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,820
You didn't

882
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,050
eat breakfast with me this morning

883
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,490
because you had it with Yan.

884
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,170
What's wrong?

885
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,300
Are you jealous?

886
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,570
Why do you hold hands

887
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,980
so soon?

888
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,460
We are holding hands, too.

889
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,650
We can even hug each other.

890
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,340
Don't be jealous.

891
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,380
Have you

892
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,610
fallen for him?

893
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,980
Kids shouldn't meddle

894
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,820
in an adult's business.

895
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,170
Chong.

896
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,780
When are you planning

897
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,740
to be honest with Zhi

898
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,530
about the fact that you

899
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,170
and Mr. Glasses Cloth

900
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,860
are the same person?

901
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,210
She knows about it.

902
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,860
Has she recognized you?

903
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,300
Even Zhi recognized you.

904
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,380
What do you mean?

905
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,650
Nothing.

906
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,530
Some people can't recognize you

907
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,980
because they can't

908
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,050
but some people can't recognize you

909
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,860
because they

910
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,780
have never remembered.

911
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,900
Slushie!

912
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,260
Slushie!

913
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,980
Hold on.

914
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,570
Let me record a video.

915
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,780
Hurry.

916
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,490
Right away.

917
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,460
Come on.

918
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,570
- All right. - Are you ready?

919
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,490
It's time to witness a miracle!

920
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,900
Three, two, one. Dig!

921
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,420
Over here!

922
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,050
Found it! It's still here!

923
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,530
Jiang.

924
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,740
Try a bottle.

925
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,740
Let me do it.

926
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,210
Be careful.

927
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,650
Cola explodes easily after freezing.

928
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,170
It's all right.

929
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,090
I'll hold it further away from me.

930
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,010
Be careful.

931
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,690
Be careful.

932
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,860
Here goes.

933
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,530
One, two...

934
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,090
I think it's a success.

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,010
It's amazing.

936
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,420
It's slushie indeed.

937
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,130
Look.

938
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,780
It's falling down.

939
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,420
Well...

940
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,650
Jiang and I will share a bottle.

941
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,860
Both of you will share a bottle.

942
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,570
No need.

943
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,010
I'll share a bottle

944
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,690
with Miss Jiang.

945
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,010
Miss Jiang?

946
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,820
Who is Miss Jiang?

947
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,780
Senior.

948
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,090
Then...

949
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,380
Master...

950
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,090
Master,

951
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,900
are you trying to drink the whole bottle alone?

952
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,260
Don't be too selfish.

953
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,130
I had a hard time

954
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,210
burying this bottle yesterday.

955
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,820
It's done.

956
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,490
- You should drink it. - Quick.

957
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,170
Thanks, Master.

958
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,740
It feels great!

959
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,050
Why don't I

960
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,650
get something to wipe the bottle for you?

961
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,570
What's wrong?

962
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,940
Why aren't you drinking?

963
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,380
Don't think about

964
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,210
joining the group forever.

965
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,340
Why?

966
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,860
Do you feel cold?

967
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,210
Not as cold as my heart.

968
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,260
Come on.

969
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,740
How? This is so high.

970
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,300
I'll die if I roll down.

971
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,050
You won't.

972
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,940
I'll catch you.

973
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,010
I don't believe you.

974
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,740
Your heart is colder than snow.

975
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,780
If you don't come down,

976
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,860
I'll show you

977
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,300
a heart that's as hard as stone.

978
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,530
I said I'd catch you

979
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,740
and you went

980
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,650
all out.

981
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,610
Coach,

982
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,530
you have a good body.

983
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,820
While doing a heelside falling leaf,

984
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,340
swinging your arms

985
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,690
won't let you keep your balance.

986
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,380
It'll only make your board shaky.

987
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,610
When will you stop touching me?

988
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,010
If you don't let go, I'll charge you.

989
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,900
I think I damaged it.

990
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,300
This board is expensive, right?

991
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:39,900
It is.

992
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,980
Don't worry.

993
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,050
I'll pay you back no matter how much it costs.

994
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,210
No need.

995
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,260
You're so kind.

996
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,980
The board is a sponsored one

997
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,900
but you still have to pay me back.

00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,320
[Snowy Classroom, Parallel Giant Slalom]

999
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,260
Coach.

1000
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,090
What are they competing?

1001
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:02,980
This?

1002
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,860
Parallel Giant Slalom in Snowboarding.

1003
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:05,820
This sport

1004
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,340
is doing a slalom on a slope

1005
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,740
with a certain degree of incline.

1006
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,380
It is a competition

1007
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,610
of making 25 corners and going past every gate

1008
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,130
to decide the winner

1009
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,530
with the fastest time.

1010
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,940
Can it be competed

1011
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,940
on every slope?

1012
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,090
Of course, not.

1013
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,570
The slope for this sport

1014
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,980
requires a length of 400 meters

1015
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:21,820
to 700 meters,

1016
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,260
a width of 40 meters at least

1017
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,650
and an altitude difference between 120 meters

1018
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,940
and 200 meters.

1019
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,090
There are two lanes

1020
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,050
with red and blue gates.

1021
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,090
During the competition,

1022
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,210
both teams go against each other

1023
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,170
to see who goes over the finish line first.

1024
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,260
This looks so difficult.

1025
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,650
What kind of skills are required?

1026
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,420
It tests

1027
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,940
an athlete's turning skills

1028
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,820
and braking skills.

1029
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,820
Balancing the course's

1030
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,780
turning apex

1031
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,860
is the core difficulty of this event.

1032
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,980
Coach.

1033
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,980
Why are their boards

1034
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,740
standing

1035
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,980
when they are skiing?

1036
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,050
Most of the time,

1037
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,420
a snowboarder's snowboard

1038
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,460

1039
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,530
in the

1040
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,610
Parallel Giant Slalom event.

1041
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,380
This method of skiing

1042
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,340
is carving.

1043
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,650
It represents athletes' ability

1044
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,010
to turn with their bodies.

1045
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,940
It also represents

1046
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,780
their ability

1047
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,860
to choose the best route.

1048
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:01,900
It is the key

1049
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,490
to getting a good result for this event.

1050
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,740
Can I...

1051
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,820
Can you turn

1052
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,980
or carve?

1053
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,530
We should eat first.
