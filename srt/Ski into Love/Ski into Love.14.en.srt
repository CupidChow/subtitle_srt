[Ski into Love]

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,980
[Adapted from Jinjiang Literature City's novel "Ski into Love" by Qing Mei]

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 14]

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,180
For all these years,

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,660
I've never thought of her as my sister,

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,820
but from now on,

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,740
I'll only think of her as my own sister.

33
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,570
If you treat her badly

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,590
or break her heart,

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,340
then I'll definitely...

36
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,340
Won't have that day.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,090
I'm so blessed to have met her,

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,250
so I'm going to cherish her.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,900
About those worries that you

40
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,490
just mentioned,

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,530
I'll prove it with my actions.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,140
At work?

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,060
Painting.

44
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,770
Then I won't bother you.

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,620
I just want to get you some fruit.

46
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,290
I'll be done in ten minutes.

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,170
Are you busy?

48
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,730
No, I'm not.

49
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,330
Come in.

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,570
I'll tell you the story of my drawing

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,760
after I finish this page.

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,730
The protagonist

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,940
of the story

54
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,380
didn't really go

55
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,570
to a so-called other world.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,010
It was just a dream he had

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,220
while he was in a coma.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,770
He tries hard to wake up,

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,980
but his body is out of control.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,540
This subconscious perception

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,700
only appears in dreams.

62
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,140
The story setting

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,290
sounds pretty interesting.

64
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,700
Anyway,

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm telling a story

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,450
about love

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,010
and rebirth.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,380
Wei Zhi.

69
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,410
Try your best.

70
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,740
I hope your work

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,820
will have a good result.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Master.

73
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,620
Do you know

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,530
why the main character of my comic

75
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,770
is a king in hibernation?

76
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,010
Because the protagonist of the story

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,380
is indeed a hibernating king,

78
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,860
but even if he falls into a short slumber,

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,770
I believe

80
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,500
that one day he will be able to wake up

81
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,970
and reclaim his throne.

82
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,410
He'll work hard quietly in his dreams

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,860
and wake up to amaze everyone.

84
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,470
So

85
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,500
do you understand

86
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,140

94
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,620
What for?

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,970
The national team is training here,

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,910
so I invited two friends

from the team.

98

Maybe

100
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,180
they'll have the material you need.

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,410

How's business these days?

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,860
Haven't you seen it?

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,180
No one comes during the day.

109
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,700
They're all at the ski slopes.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,970
It's better at night.

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,010
I can survive anyway.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,820
I'm not talking about your bar

113
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,330
but your ski club.

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,300
It's okay.

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,530
I'm here.

They're really coming.

118
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,450
Shipping a couple will only hurt you.

120
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,740
Long time no see.

121
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,380
Long time no see.

122
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,410

Don't call me that.

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,380
Just call me Wei Zhi.

127
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,260
Thank you for coming to see me.

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,330

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,890
Okay.

139
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,940
Have a good chat.

140
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,260
I'll order some drinks.

141
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,090
- All right. - All right.

142
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,180
Actually,

143
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,300
I wanted to ask.

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,090
How many years have you been skiing?

145
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,090
I've been skiing for eight years.

146
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,380
Five years.

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,740
Five years? That long?

148
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,210
Mr. Huang.

149
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,500
Two more iced Americanos.

150
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,210
Yes.

151
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,260
Dajing was here last time.

152
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,530
I heard

153
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,410
you're still practicing big air.

154
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,090
To be honest,

155
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,380
we'd really like to see you

156
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,500
back on the national team.

157
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,570
Tell me the truth,

158
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,330
are you interested

159
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,500
in the World Cup?

160
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,060
My current situation

161
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,890
doesn't allow me to be interested.

162
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,530
What's your situation now?

163
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
Why can't you be interested?

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,140
Can't you still ski?

165
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,830
You, a kid, don't get involved in grown-up affairs.

166
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,820
Who's a kid?

167
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,560
If you're not interested,

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
why did you come to Lezhou?

169
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,970
Dai, talk nicely.

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,270
Have you forgotten

171
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,820
what you promised me?

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,450
You know what?

173
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,820
Actually,

174
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,620
I've known about you for a long time.

175
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,090
At that time, our coach showed us

176
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,330
the video of your game

177
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,140
for us to analyze.

178
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,450
I was thinking...

179
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,940
I didn't think about how to beat you.

180
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,740
I was thinking about

181
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,080
when I could be

182
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,150
as good as you

183
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,970
and ski that well.

184
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,970
In fact, in this game,

185
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,940
you could have placed further

186
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,770
if you hadn't made

187
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,180
the first mistake.

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,260
Yes.

189
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,300
It's true that I didn't

190
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,740
adjust well this time,

191
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,650
but that's not the level I'm at.

192
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,140
I can definitely perform

193
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,220
very well next time.

194
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,340
My dream is to compete

195
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,010
in the Winter Olympics.

196
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,810
Olympic Games.

197
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,010
Do you?

198
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,740
Of course.

199
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,580
I will participate in the Olympics too.

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,380
I'll go together with you.

201
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,690
Together with me?

202
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,770
Isn't your family in Canada?

203
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,050
My nationality is Chinese.

204
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
I want to represent my country

205
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,500
in the Olympics with you,

206
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,010
Then you can practice more.

207
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,230
You can't make the national team

208
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,220
at your current level.

209
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,110
You look down on me, don't you?

210
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,100
Now that you've said that,

211
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,170
I'll see you on the national team.

212
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay. I'll wait for you.

213
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,150
You must.

214
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,860
One more latte.

215
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,290
Okay.

216
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
To the Nationals together.

217
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,850
To the Olympics together.

218
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,260
What did I promise you?

219
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,860
You know what you promised me.

220
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,200
Do you know

221
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,220
that everyone on the team is waiting for you now?

222
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,140
Mr. Wang has been waiting for you to go to him.

223
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,140
Dai, sit down.

224
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,860
I won't.

225
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,170
Let me do it.

226
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,680
Shan Chong, look at me.

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,100
Give me an answer today.

228
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,810
Do you want to return

229
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,740
to the national team?

230
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,410
Tell me.

231
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,860
Good.

232
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,050
You won't say, huh?

233
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,010
Then keep escaping.

234
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,460
Keep being a loser.

235
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,980
Keep being a loser.

236
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,010
Why are you cursing?

237
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,460
What do you know that makes you talk like that?

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,220
Okay.

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,170
Ignore him.

240
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,460
Finish your interview.

241
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,620
Chong, then we...

242
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,620
Let's do it some other time.

244
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,740
- Okay. - Okay.

245
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,740
Thank you.

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,050
Take it easy.

247
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,810
Sit down.

248
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,860
That idiot.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,140
How could he say that about you?

250
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,500
I never want to see him again.

251
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,890
To him,

252
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,500
I am indeed a loser

253
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,690
who keeps running away.

254
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,580
I know you're not.

255
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,340
Of course not.

256
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,860
Who I am isn't determined

257
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,010
by what other people think.

258
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,410
I'll go back sooner or later,

259
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,140
but

260
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,690
I'll wait a little longer.

261
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,810
At the very least, I have to save up enough money

262
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,050
to get Shan fitted for good prosthetic legs.

263
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,810
Master.

264
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,050
If...

265
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,770
If you don't have enough money...

266
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,340
Don't worry.

267
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,860
I'll have enough soon.

268
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,170
And

269
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
Shan has a job

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,410
she likes now.

271
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,410
I'll be more relieved

272
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
if she has a good pair of prostheses.

273
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,690
And your mom and dad...

274
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,530
Hello?

275
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,140
Tiger Animation?

276
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,100
Wu Manman?

277
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,650
Yes.

278
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,530
Actually,

279
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,040
I'm working on a comic

280
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,930
about snowboarding.

281
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,530
Mr. Wang gave me

282
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,930
your contact information

283
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,830
and wanted me to ask you a few questions.

284
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,170
Is this a good time for you?

285
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,410
Let me ask first.

286
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,770
Is the comic about snowboarding

287
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,340
you just mentioned

288
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,290
the one you're going to use for the competition?

289
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes, it is.

290
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,950
I've prepared

291
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,650
[Interview outline]
a few outlines for the interview.

292
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,650
I can't do the interview

294
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,530
because I've already agreed

295
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,770
to be someone's snowboard consultant.

296
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,740
You turned it down?

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,740
You turned it down?

299
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,140
Why?

300
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,460
Why don't you want money

301
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,410
from Wang Laohu?

302
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,580
You can talk to her again.

303
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,860
She's going to be in the competition too,

304
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,810
so isn't she your competitor?

305
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,440
That's not a contradiction.

306
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,740
We can compete fairly.

307
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,690
I have confidence

308
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,810
in my own work.

309
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,410
I won't help her.

310
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,810
Why?

311
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,340
I just want to help you.

312
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,410
Oh, my God.

313
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,110
If you say so, there will be nothing wrong

314
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,770
with you not making money from him.

315
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,740
Master.

316
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,690
Do you think there are sugarplums here?

317
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,500
Do you want some?

318
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,410
I want it to be sweeter.

319
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,690
Let's go.

320
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,340
Bunch of rookies.

321
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,170
Incompetent.

322
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,220
- When did you throw away all your cards? - Little rookie.

323
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,500
When did you get down to one card?

324
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,650
Spin it.

325
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,810
Beici, spin it.

326
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,380
Spin it.

327
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,170
Now.

328
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,010
Now.

329
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,930
Ask someone.

330
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,100
Drink half.

331
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,140
Drink half.

332
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,690
Come on.

333
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,380
Drink half. Come on.

334
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,140
I'll drink with you.

335
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,810
Come on.

336
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,860
Drink half.

337
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,980
Come on.

338
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,530
Come on.

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,620
- Be careful. - Master bought you

340
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,220
some candy canes.

341
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,160
- Thank you. - Thank you.

342
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you, Zhi.

343
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,340
Sit down.

344
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,120
Come on. Everyone will have it.

345
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,980
Thank you.

346
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,770
You bought this especially for Zhi

347
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,500
and only for us in passing, right?

348
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,170
Master.

349
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,500
Am I your favorite disciple?

350
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,860
Tell me.

351
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,770
You never were.

352
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,690
You're making a fool of yourself.

353
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Come on, Chong.

354
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,620
Zhi.

355
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,050
Thank you.

356
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,050
Everyone in the groups today

357
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,140
said Chong has a girlfriend.

358
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,290
So

359
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,770
are you going to publicize it?

360
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,500
I've worked hard to grow up together

361
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,530
with Wei Zhi all these years

362
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,410
and fended off a lot of scumbags for her in the process.

363
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,380
Chong.

364
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,050
Settle my escrow fees for all these years.

365
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,050
Transferring money is fine.

366
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,290
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

367
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,810
I'll be truly good to her.

368
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,460
I'll be truly good to you.

369
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,080
What does Dai Duo mean?

370
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,140
Why did he send me a video?

371
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,810
What?

372
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,690
He wants you to watch it.

373
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,700
- Me? - Childish.

374
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,690
What does he mean?

375
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,340
Chong, is Dai Duo

376
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,410
going too far?

377
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,340
Going too far?

378
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,890
Who does he think he is?

379
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,620
Master, can you stand this?

380
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,520
If you can, I...

381
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,220
I can't.

382
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,770
I said

383
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,650
I can't.

384
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,400
Get the moves right.

385
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,380
You've just finished eating.

386
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,010
Cheer yourselves up.

387
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,980
One more time.

388
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,410
Where did you lift your leg?

389
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,820
Do you want to break your leg on the platform?

390
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,490
How many times have I told you? Tighten the core of your body.

391
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,170
Tighten the core of your body.

392
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,580
Where's your body core?

393
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,210
Take it out on me if you have anger.

394
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,780
Don't scare the youngsters.

395
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,020
Brat.

396
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,650
Do you need a spanking?

397
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,340
Don't just talk.

398
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,930
Spank him now, sir.

399
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,100
You can't bear to, can you?

400
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,170
But I can.

401
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,100
I'll do that for you.

402
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,580
I can spank you.

403
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,730
I can spank you.

404
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,730
Brat.

405
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,730
That hurts.

406
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,690
Why did you come back?

407
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,690
Guess.

408
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,100
Teach that kid a lesson.

409
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,780
Master.

410
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,060
I'll be sure to record

411
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,380
this epic moment for you.

412
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,340
I brought binoculars.

413
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,060
Why did you bring binoculars?

414
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,650
I first came to Xicheng to see the birds,

415
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,240
but now I'll just have to reluctantly

416
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,380
watch you compete.

417
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,540
Okay.

418
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,760
Find out if your boyfriend

419
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,300
is handsome or not.

420
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,410
You have to be careful

421
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,820
when you are skiing.

422
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,860
Don't worry.

423
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,690
Master, go for it.

424
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,300
Come on.

425
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,240
Is Chong here

426
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,860
to rebut someone on the spot?

427
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,690
Rebut?

428
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,410
Rebut who?

429
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,540
Dai Duo?

430
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,860
What you did yesterday

431
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,490
was cork 1440 with triple inward rotation.

432
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,470
What was that?

433
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,450
Is there anyone else

434
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,540
on our team besides you

435
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,280
who can do this?

436
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,060
Just because you guys can't

437
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,210
doesn't mean he can't.

438
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,210
Why did you come with me?

439
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,650
Are you that worried about me?

440
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,060
Of course.

441
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,930
How long has it been since you practiced big air?

442
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,730
I usually do,

443
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,140
but you...

444
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,540
You're so old but still worrying about others.

445
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,690
I think

446
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,300
you should worry about your hair.

447
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,780
My hair?

448
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,530
Boy.

449
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,780
My hair.

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,490
My...

451
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,650
Every hair on my head

452
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,690
has a name.

453
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,380
Sir.

454
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,890
Don't worry.

455
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,540
I know what to do.

456
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,890
No problem.

457
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,300
That's it.

458
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,300
I'm going to stop talking to you.

459
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,060
See you at the bottom of the hill.

460
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,100
Such a high platform.

461
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,330
I'm afraid I'll never be able

462
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,210
to stand on it in my life.

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,220
Can Shan Chong do it now?

464
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,100
For sure.

465
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,300
My master

466
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,380
can fly.

467
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,820
Yes, he can fly.

468
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:41,260
[Dangerous stunts. Do not attempt]

469
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,060
[Dangerous stunts. Do not attempt]

470
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:57,780
[Dangerous stunts. Do not attempt]

471
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,210
Master, you're the best.

472
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,100
Awesome.

473
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,890
Brat.

474
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,250
Chong.

475
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,350
Chong.

476
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,300
You did it, cool!

477
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,380
Awesome!

478
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,620
That's awesome.

479
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,890
Chong.

480
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,210
Chong.

481
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,450
Chong.

482
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,140
Awesome!

483
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,690
You just asked me why I came back.

484
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,410
Because I'm telling you

485
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,410
I saw that.

486
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,300
I saw it too.

487
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,860
You just...

488
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,020
You still look the same.

489
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,340
I surely don't look like you.

490
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,100
Of course not,

491
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,060
but so what?

492
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,410
I was not much older than you are now

493
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,410
when I first joined the national team,

494
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,140
but honestly, Shan Chong,

495
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,170
I can't do this for long.

496
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,620
Come back.

497
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,490
Okay.

498
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,210
You promise?

499
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,250
Shan Chong.

500
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,970
What did you say?

501
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,300
Did you say you'd come back?

502
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,100
Listen.

503
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,020
This time, you have to promise us

504
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,170
and not go back on that.

505
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,580
Don't lie, okay?

506
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,410
Got it.

507
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,490
Brat.

508
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,140
I can't come back to the team right away,

509
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,820
but now that I've promised,

510
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,780
I'll never regret it.

511
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,690
You're two men. What are doing?

512
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,300
Why are you crying?

513
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,020
Let me join you.

514
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,690
Come back.

515
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,820
Come back.

516
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,060
I have.

517
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,820
Nice.

518
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,490
Put me down now.

519
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,620
You were in the air.

520
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,860
Master.

521
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,100
Would you like to have a celebratory feast?

522
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,100
Sure,

523
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,620
but I'm not treating today.

524
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,100
Why not?

525
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,580
The roasted goat last time was my treat.

526
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,110
But

527
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,080
you're not only a guest

528
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,410
but also let us be your guests, you know?

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,580
What about that?

530
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,620
Does your boyfriend look better

531
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,930
in the binoculars?

532
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,910
Of course.

533
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,410
Super handsome.

534
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,140
I'm really going back to the Nationals.

535
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,170
I know.

536
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,100
Congratulations.

537
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,450
Master.

538
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,450
You've taken your first step,

539
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,580
and so have we.

540
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,730
We've finished the first chapter.

541
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,820
In a moment, we'll upload it to the contest's official website.

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,970
Let's work hard together.

543
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,340
Work hard together.

544
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,060
Let's go, Wei Zhi.

545
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,890
Hurry up.

546
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,650
Coming.

547
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,410
Then I'm going to submit it.

548
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,780
I'm a little nervous.

549
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
[Uploading as fast as I can!]

550
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,140
Done.

551
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,940
[Congratulations, chapter submission successful!]

552
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,780
I'm still stewing the ribs.

553
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,100
I'm gonna leave.

554
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,340
- Okay, keep in touch. - Bye.

555
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,780
I have something else to do.

556
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,580
I have to go too.

557
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,690
Shan.

558
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,540
Did you watch the video?

559
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,580
What video?

560
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,490
Nothing. Go ahead.

561
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,970
Bye.

562
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,580
[He is surely the king of big air!]

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,180
[Feiniao]

564
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,100
Let's go.

565
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,210
Let's go.

566
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,040
Be careful.

567
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,430
This is even prettier than last year.

568
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,020
Master.

569
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,650
Beautiful.

570
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,580
Yan.

571
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,300
It's been a year.

572
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,410
Welcome back.

573
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,860
It's been a long time.

574
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,620
Come on.

575
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
Be careful.

576
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,970
Be careful. It's slippery.

577
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,490
Come on.

578
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,210
Come on.

579
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,140
Be careful. Long time no see.

580
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,020
Come in.

581
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,340
The treasures are here.

582
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,890
Come on. Come in.

583
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,350
Bazha, you don't need to introduce us.

584
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,540
- I'll do the talking. - Come in.

585
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,170
First-timers, listen.

586
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,060
These

587
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,280
are Bazha's grandfather's coats

588
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,580
and his saddles

589
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,860
from his days

590
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,820
on the frontier.

591
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,390
And this is...

592
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,340
- Oil lamp. - Oil lamp.

593
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,930
Yes.

594
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,520
And these

595
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,620
are all old things too.

596
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,820
This is a photo

597
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,540
from 40 years ago.

598
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,060
This was taken the year I was born.

599
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,300
The Haden Platform

600
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,930
and the bonfire are here.

601
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,690
The real treasures

602
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,020
are here.

603
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,890
Yeah. There's more in there.

604
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,140
It's all here.

605
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,210
Come on.

606
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,020
Look.

607
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,580
These are handmade leather boots.

608
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,860
This is a horse harness.

609
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,490
And that...

610
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,210
Bazha, this is...

611
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,930
Yogurt.

612
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,210
- For fermenting yogurt? - Yes.

613
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,730
A vat.

614
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,580
That's a unique ski.

615
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,780
This is a great ski.

616
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,450
This ski is made

617
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,100
of horsehide.

618
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,140
In an avalanche like the last one,

619
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,620
we can only use it for rescue.

620
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,690
It has exceptionally high friction

621
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,540
and is better than today's skis.

622
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,690
Let me take you guys to change your clothes.

623
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,780
Clothes too?

624
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,530
Great.

625
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,020
Let's go.

626
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,760
OK.

627
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,410
Let's go.

628
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,170
I want to be the first.

629
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,170
This one looks good.

630

Yan.

631
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,930
It suits you.

632
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,540
Come on, Yan.

633
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,890
- And the hat. - I've already chosen it for you.

634
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,060
Yes. It's all good.

635
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,690
This is nice.

636
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,480
Look at this hat.

637
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,780
I like this hat.

638
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,890
It suits you.

639
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,620
Which one do you choose?

640
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,450
Can I not change?

641
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,020
You have to.

642
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,780
We're going to take pictures later.

643
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,670
Go and change.

644
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,490
Does it look good?

645
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,210
Go.

646
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,410
Yes, Beici, come on.

647
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,350
Now pick one.

648
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,060
Pick one for me.

649
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,140
This black one.

650
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,410
I had my eye on it just now.

651
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,340
It fits you perfectly.

652
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,410
It's so handsome.

653
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,580
Isn't it?

654
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,080
Come on. Stand still.

655
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,910
I'll take pictures for you.

656
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,930
- Take a picture. - Come on. Come on.

657
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,780
Three, two, one.

658
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,730
Three, two, one.

659
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,820
What's this?

660
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,580
Zhi.

661
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,410
Dance, Zhi.

662
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,020
Raise your glasses.

663
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,410
Dear friends,

664
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,340
we are gathered here today

665
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,300
to...

666
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,210
Irritate Dai Duo.

667
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,170
It's not just about that.

668
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,020
It's to celebrate the longevity

669
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,340
and everlastingness

670
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,820
of our friendship.

671
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,890
You're so good at talking.

672
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,060
This flavor.

673
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,650
Usually.

674
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,770
Zhi, take a look.

675
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,100
I sent you the video just now.

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,930
That was a fun dance.

[Qianhe Bar]

678
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,410
Come on.

679
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,860
Don't rush.

[Performing Arts Hall]

681
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,340
[@Yan: See?]

682
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,700
[You're good at provoking]

683
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,890
What's so funny?

684
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,100
Hot milk tea.

685
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,340
Friends, come on.

686
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,170
Let's drink.

687
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,020
So nice.

688
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,890
No. You have to read this review.

689
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,420
[It's hilarious. I'm sure they have the same master!]

690
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,960
[Dude, actually, Chong is Dai's master.]

691
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,460
[So are they master and disciple or students of the same coach?]

692
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,300
Master.

693
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,450
When are you planning to go back?

694
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,340
I plan to save up for a year first.

695
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,340
Next year

696
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,340
at the latest.

697
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,860
Don't worry.

698
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,820
Everyone knows that.

699
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,060
Master.

700
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,430
I never asked you.

701
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,210
How far have you gotten in saving for Shan?

702
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,450
I want to give Shan

703
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,410
the best prosthetic legs.

704
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,540
She needs some rehab, too.

705
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,210
What happened to his sister's leg?

706
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,340
But I'm about to save enough,

707
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,540
so it shouldn't take more than a year.

708
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,410
Master.

709
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,820
We said before

710
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,150
that we could all chip in together.

711
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,890
That'll be enough.

712
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,730
Why are you wasting one more year?

713
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,730
Yes, Master.

714
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,890
If a man lives to be 80,

715
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,100
that's 30,000 days at most.

716
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,250
Don't waste your time.

717
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,060
Don't turn it down right away.

718
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,780
We can think of it as an investment in a world champion.

719
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,820
Only a fool wouldn't invest in it, right?

720
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,380
Come on, Huayan.

721
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,340
You're exaggerating.

722
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,540
I'm not, Chong.

723
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,830
If you get back today,

724
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,100
you can still make this year's weighted ranking tournament.

725
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,450
If something else delays it

726
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,410
and affects your ranking,

727
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,410
you'll have to wait another four years.

728
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,100
Four years.

729
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,620
I wanted to go to the tournament

730
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,650

I appreciate the gesture.

Aren't you going to join them?

759

760
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,730

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,730
my family runs a private hospital

768
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,370
specializing in orthopedics and rehabilitation,

769
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,080
and we have a long-term relationship

770
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,980
with the best

771
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,620
prosthetic supplier in Germany.

772
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,900
If you can trust me,

773
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,810
leave your sister's case to me.

774
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,850
I can provide her

775
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,140
with the best customized prosthesis,

776
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,140
the best medical environment,

777
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,540
and the best price.

778
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,770
Actually, this won't trouble us.

779
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,250
It happens to be about orthopedics.

780
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,290
Come in.

781
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,580
Sweetheart.

782
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,810
Take a break.

783
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,690
You've been painting all afternoon.

784
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,900
It's okay, Mom. I'm not tired.

785
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,540
Stop it, even if you're not tired.

786
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,140
What if you're nearsighted?

787
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,940
OK.

788
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,250
I'll just take a break

789
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,140
by watching some videos.

790
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,210
This...

791
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,220
[@Yan: See?]

792
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,850
Let me see.

793
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,020
- It's nothing. - Nothing?

794
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,850
Let me see.

795
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,290
It's a lot like your brother.

796
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,370
I saw the surprise you mentioned,

797
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,730
but the bad news is

798
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,580
that so did my mom,

799
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,210
so it might not be a surprise

800
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,980
but a shock this time.

801
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,420
I've already figured out which radiator

802
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,210
my brother's gonna kneel on when he gets back.

803
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,210
Dancing.

804
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,170
What's this?

805
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,580
I'm going to get some milk tea.

806
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,620
I'll be back afterward.

807
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,170
Candy?

808
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,250
This is called Qashu.

809
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,180
In the old days on the steppe,

810
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,330
if an honored guest came,

811
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,900
they would hold this ceremony

812
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,210
to bring happiness and good fortune to the guest.

813
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,170
Fortune and happiness?

814
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,420
I'll have to pick up some more.

815
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,370
Let's go over and have a look.

816
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,310
Yiming.

817
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,440
A little happiness and good fortune for you.

818
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,190
Thank you.

819
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,690
Come on. Have some hot milk tea.

820
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,900
This hot milk tea is delicious.

821
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,060
Come on.

822
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,770
Come on.

823
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,290
Thank you.

824
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,580
Yiming, thank you

825
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,540
for helping Shan Chong so much.

826
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,250
It's just a small favor.

827
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,500
I'm a doctor.

828
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,810
I hope

829
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,650
I can really help your sister

830
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,980
and she can stand up.

831
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,620
Jiang Yiming.

832
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,940
Thank you.

833
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,520
Don't say that.

834
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,770
Come on. Let's drink.

835
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
Cheers.

836
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,580
Come on.

837
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Oh, my God.

838
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,730
I'm getting really old.

839
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,540
I feel more tired dancing than skiing.

840
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,730
Who is old?

841
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,330
What did you mean?

842
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,370
I'm here.

843
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,620
Don't think too much.

844
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,020
You're too sensitive.

845
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,730
Oh, no.

846
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,810
I didn't just record a video.

847
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,370
It's such a rare bonfire.

848
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,770
If I had a video,

849
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,100
my account would be hot again.

850
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,960
You can't even speak clearly,

851
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,560
so how can you be a self-media creator

852
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,020
who makes money?

853
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,210
Don't mess yourself up.

854
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,670
How can I mess myself up

855
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,330
even if I can't get rich?

856
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,290
Don't.

857
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,620
I have an idea.

858
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,850
I'm an orthopedic surgeon,

859
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,770
and you're a photographer,

860
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,290
so we could do a cross-collaboration.

861
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,730
You're the photo blogger

862
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,980
recommended by an orthopedic surgeon.

863
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,100
That's a good one.

864
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,250
- Let's go. - Let's do it.

865
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,330
Let's go to the bonfire

866
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,170
and work on it.

867
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,690
Let's go.

868
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,330
Huayan, come with me.

869
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,770
Take a video for me.

870
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,850
Be safe.

871
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,330
So many stars.

872
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,140
Master.

873
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,690
I have a feeling

874
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,290
that Shan's problem

875
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,170
will be solved very smoothly.

876
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,060
Also, you're going to fly high

877
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,940
in the weighted ranking tournament.

878
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,580
And your comic is 100%

879
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,730
going to be number one.

880
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,650
That's right.

881
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,540
Law of attraction.

882
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,520
But aren't you forgetting

883
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,580
to say something?

884
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,020
Forgetting what?

885
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,500
What about us?

886
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,900
Us?

887
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,900
You don't have to ask.

888
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,650
We're going to be

889
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,250
as happy

890
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,170
and sweet

891
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,690
as this candy,

892
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,060
right?

893
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,540
Senior.

894
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,330
What will happen when we go back

895
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,290
to Nancheng?

896
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,900
What do you mean?

897
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,690
I understand.

898
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,060
Understand what?

899
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,540
You're imagining things all day long.

900
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,690
Do you think in years to come,

901
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,980
you'll remember

902
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,770
that we watched the sunrise together,

903
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,690
danced around the campfire,

904
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,290
and saw the beautiful starry sky?

905
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,770
Probably.

906
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,170
But I like

907
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,940
to look ahead more often.

908
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,420
Listen.

909
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,210
I have two pieces of good news.

910
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,650
Which one do you want to hear first?

911
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,170
One of the good news is

912
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,290
that your brother is coming home tomorrow,

913
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,860
and I'm going to be with him.

914
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,540
Are you happy?

915
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,060
Miss Zhai, tell me the truth.

916
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,170
Did you come to rush me to submit the manuscript?

917
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,650
How could I be so mean?

918
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,520
I have another piece of good news

919
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,790
to tell you in person

920
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,850
to surprise you.

921
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,060
Again?

922
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,140
What's the surprise this time?

923
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,620
Is...

924
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,620
Is it really a surprise?

925
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,290
Don't give me a shock.

926
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,620
See you next time.

927
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,560
I haven't had enough.

928
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,210
See you at the weighted ranking tournament.

929
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,170
Hey, guys. I'm going to leave.

930
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,210
I can't make it. Bye. Yan.

931
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,850
- Yan. - Be safe, Yan.

932
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,170
Why did you change your ticket to take an earlier flight?

933
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,500
I told you I had a family emergency.

934
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,250
See you later, bye.

935
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,610
- Yan. - Be safe.

936
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,940
- I'll miss you. - See you later.

937
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,100
I haven't played enough.

938
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
[Snowy Classroom: big air]

939
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,940
Do you know the main sport I play?

940
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,500
I know.

941
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,480
Snowboarding

942
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,650
became an official sport

943
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,840
at the 18th Winter Olympics

944
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,420
in 1998.

945
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,140
Snowboarding big air d.

946
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:07,960
requires athletes

947
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,620
to ski down a slope at a height

948
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,020
of nearly 100 meters at high speed,

949
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:11,900
jump on a diving platform,

950
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,650
complete a specific maneuver in the air,

951
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,620
and land on the ground in the end.

952
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,660
China's best performance in snowboarding big air

953
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,980
so far comes from Su Yiming.

954
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,810
She won the snowboard big air title

955
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,060
at the 2002 Beijing Winter Olympics.

956
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,290
Why do you know so much?

957
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,290
Of course.

958
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,670
I did a lot of homework

959
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,170
to create Ski Into Love.

960
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,620
Just to draw a good comic?

961
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,580
Also for you, of course.

962
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,540
Let me test you.

963
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,060
How does scoring work

964
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,250
in snowboarding big air?

965
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,520
Scoring in big air is divided

966
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,940
into four main sections.

967
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,850
Difficulty,

968
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,580
Height,

969
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,500
Creativity,

970
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,420
and Perfection.

971
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,940
Details.

972
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,540
Master, let's go into details.

973
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,140
We have three rounds.

974
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,420
Male athletes

975
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,360
will use different kinds of movements

976
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,770
in at least two of the three rounds,

977
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,810
such as flat spin or off-axis spin.

978
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,810
Female athletes

979
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,880
have to perform different rotations

980
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,370
in at least two rounds.

981
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,940
The final score is the sum

982
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,290
of the highest scores in two rounds.

983
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,030
The criteria for perfection

984
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,540
include

985
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,250
jump,

986
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,060
grab,

987
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,370
control of aerial posture,

988
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,210
fluency,

989
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,900
style,

990
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,540
and landing.

991
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,580
Difficulty is assessed

992
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,850
by the number of turns

993
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,750
and the difficulty of the turns

994
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,810
made by the athlete in each direction.

995
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,060
The height requirement is

996
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,690
a reasonable trajectory

997
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,960
and good height

998
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,150
that ensures the athlete

999
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,500
lands in a reasonable area.

1000
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,540
Creativity means

1001
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,060
that in comparison to the basic movement,

1002
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,210
if a movement is new

1003
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:26,440
or uncommon,

1004
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,920
the judges may recognize it

1005
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,060
as creativity.

1006
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,770
Master.

1007
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,650
So is it true that a higher difficulty makes it better?

1008
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,500
It is somehow true,

1009
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,650
but in this sport,

1010
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,360
originality and innovativeness

1011
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,940
are more attractive

1012
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,020
than high difficulty.

1013
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,100
So

1014
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:40,920
difficulty is only one

1015
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,210
of the three scoring criteria.

1016
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,210
The height and perfection also have an impact.

1017
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,140
On top of that,

1018
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,060
we have to look at the elegance

1019
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,100
of the aerial parabola formed by the athlete's jump,

1020
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,250
the adequacy of the explosive power of the jump,

1021
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,460
the success of the landing,

1022
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,140
if there is any substantial change of center of gravity,

1023
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,060
hand touchdowns, ski slalom,

1024
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,060
edge control,

1025
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,290
snow flurries, and so on.

1026
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,060
Master.

1027
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,900
What's going on?

1028
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,690
