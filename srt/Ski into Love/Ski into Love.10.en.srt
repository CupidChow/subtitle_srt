Try the milk tea she made.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,980
It's really good.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,620
Sure, where is it?

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,460
Here.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,210
Master,

34
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,620
thank you for making the BBQ.

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,100
Please enjoy the milk tea I made.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,410
Let me serve you.

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,130
Here.

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,330
Is it too hot?

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,100
Are you okay?

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,740
Hot, hot!

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,930
You idiot.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,290
Use tongs.

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,290
Take them.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,980
I'll add some ice for you.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,730
It's so sweet.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,540
Nice.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,450
It tastes great.

48
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,570
- You take over. - Alright.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,130

It's so sweet.

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,130

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,450
He's acting so differently.

57

He's so gentle with Zhi.

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,500
He's even roasting marshmallows for her.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,100
He's finally getting it.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Don't be jealous. You're not invited.

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,170
Thanks.

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,540
Let's eat.

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,220
I'm roasting another one.

66
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,260
Are you free tomorrow morning?

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,500
Yeah.

68
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,170
Why?

69
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,610
Didn't you say you needed inspiration?

70
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,940
I set up a meeting for you with a friend.

71
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,170
He's free tomorrow morning.

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,450

73
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,980
Sounds great.

74
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,340
Thanks, Master.

Actually, when it comes to snowboarding stories,

76
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,820
I already have

the perfect inspiration.

This uncrowned king of big air snowboarding

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,660

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,500
I hope I can hear his story one day.

81
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,780
This is Jia,

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,610
a legend of parachute skiing.

83
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,100
Parachute skiing?

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,050
You jump out of a helicopter

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,250
with your skis,

86
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,850
parachute onto a mountain,

87
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,340
and then slide down.

88
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,900
That sounds insane!

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,100
That's why he's a legend.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,140
Compared to Chong,

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,540
I'm just average.

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,540
Come on, let's skip the flattery.

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,930
This is Wei Zhi,

Nice to meet you, Jia.

97
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,900
You, too.

98
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,730
What an honor.

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,490
So, this is the "little one"

100
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,250
you mentioned on WeChat, huh?

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,410
Let's get started.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,980
You can ask Jia

103
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,580
anything you want.

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,140
Jia,

105
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,540
thank you for taking the time

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,460
to talk with me.

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,250
I may be

108
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,700
taking down notes.

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,460
Do you mind?

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,930
No problem. Go ahead.

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,610
It's fine.

112
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,900
Why did you

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,050
choose

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,220
such a challenging sport

115
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,050
as your passion?

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,250
Well,

117
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,020
I've already conquered

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,730
every known slope at every known resort

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,490
in the world.

120
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,370
But I realized

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,370
the greatest challenge

122
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,810
is conquering the unknown.

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,170
So,

124
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,220
I fell in love

125
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,730
with parachute skiing,

126
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,810
which lets me chase

127
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,490
the thrill of the unknown.

128
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,780
Thank you, Jia.

129
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,290
I've learned so much today.

130
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,610
If you have other questions,

131
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,340
just come to me.

132
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,580
Thanks for your time.

133
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,220
Let's catch up again when we're free.

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,660
See you at the summit.

135
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,580
Take care of your "little one."

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,980
Why did you call me "little one"?

137
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,490
Is there a problem with that?

138
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,020
Why not just say

139
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,290
I'm a friend?

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,660
Jia is

141
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,490
much nosier than he appears.

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,050
When I messaged him to set up this meeting,

143
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,580
he refused to agree

144
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,490
unless I clarified

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,810
our relationship.

146
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,460
So,

147
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,100
you called me...

148
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,930
"Little one."

149
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,460
Why didn't you say

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,220
we're just casual friends?

151
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,900
Casual friends?

152
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,410
Are we?

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,900
I...

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,220
I still have notes to take.

155
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,850
I'm leaving.

156
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,410
It's settled, then.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,050
Shan, please go through the recordings

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,250
from this morning's interview.

159
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,100
List everything

160
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,140
we can use.

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,290
I'll revise

162
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,050
the story outline.

163
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,700
Elephant,

164
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,490
help refine

165
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,580
the character bios.

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,370
Let me know

167
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,170
if you run into any issues.

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,100
Got it.

169
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,700
No problem.

170
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,780
All good here, too.

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,780
Okay.

172
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,580
By the way,​

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,370
let's think

174
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,540
about what title

175
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,730
we should give the comic.

176
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,540
Don't count on me.

177
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,610
I'm terrible at naming things.

Come on, girls.

181
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,810
Put more thought into it.

182
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,170
We can definitely come up with something.

183
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,140
I await your ideas.

184
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,930

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,580
so most of our study time

368
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,580
went to training instead.

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,090
Come on.

385
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,010
Cheers!

386
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,810
Hey, why aren't you eating?

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,770
It's done.

388
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,490
Dig in.

389
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,980
This batch is ready, too.

390
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,940
Let's get some ice cream.

391
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,050
Sure.

392
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,620
Excuse me.

393
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,900
Hi, have a look.

394
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,900
What flavor do you want?

395
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,530
Anything's fine.

396
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,770
We've got vanilla, cantaloupe,

397
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,250
chocolate, yogurt, walnut,

398
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,380
strawberry, cream, and honey.

399
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,380
Which one do you want?

400
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,460
One yogurt

401
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,860
and one honey.

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,900
Maybe it's because

403
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,290
this moment feels too perfect,

404
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,700
I find it

405
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,900
so hard to bring myself to ask

406
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,250
what really happened

407
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,290
or why he retired.

408
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,570
I just want this happiness

409
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,730
to last a little longer.

410
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,380
If only

411
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,490
it could

412
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,810
stay this way forever.

413
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,220
See if you

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,010
want to add anything.

415
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,980
Let's add raisins.

416
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,380
There are some nuts over there, too.

417
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,330
Which one do you want,

418
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,250
yogurt or honey?

419
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,180
I'll take this one.

420
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,980
[Jiang]

421
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,420
Taking off now.

422
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,980
Landing in five and a half hours.

423
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,290
I'm coming to you, girl!

424
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,220
You are picking me up, right?

425
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,090
I have a surprise, one I can't tell you about.

426
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,330
You have to see it for yourself.

427
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,380
Is it a surprise or a scare?

428
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,460
Five hours...

429
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,660
Hello?

430
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,530
Hello, Master.

431
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,900
Can I borrow your car?

432
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,220
Where are you going?

433
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,460
Jiang Nanfeng is arriving today.

434
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,860
I want to go pick her up.

435
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,660
I'll drive you.

436
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,330
What time does she land?

437
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,860
Oh, it's fine.

438
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,770
I have a license.

439
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,490
I can handle it.

440
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,180
I'll come get the car later.

441
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,380
Alright.

442
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,380
Thanks, Master.

443
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,770
Master.

444
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,490
Master.

445
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,530
Master.

446
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,940
Master.

447
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,420
The door's open.

448
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,700
Master, I'm here!

449
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,620
Why didn't you knock?

450
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,570
You... You didn't close the door.

451
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,420
Master,

452
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,140
that scar...

453
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:58,770
It's nothing.

454
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,660
But...

455
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,380
The fuel tank's full.

456
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,620
Remember to warm up the engine first.

457
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,620
Got it.

458
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,490
Thanks, Master.

459
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,570
I'm heading out.

460
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,090
Why didn't Beici close the door?

461
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,050
Hello,

462
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,770
are you here?

463
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,660
Hello?

464
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,220
I've landed, Zhi.

465
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,900
Where are you?

466
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,660
Did you come to pick me up?

467
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,570
Yes,

468
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,620
I'm right outside.

469
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,220
Where are you?

470
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,660
Oh, there you are!

471
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,090
Nanfeng!

472
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,770
Sweetie!

473
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,940
You're finally here.

474
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,660
Zhi!

475
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,420
Zhi!

476
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,380
Zhi!

477
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,980
What's going on?

478
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,140
Be grateful.

479
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,660
If he hadn't come,

480
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,570
your mom would've

481
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,380
come herself.

482
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,730
My goodness.

483
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,380
Why

484
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,460
didn't you warn me?

485
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,810
Zhi!

486
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,860
Hi, Yiming.

487
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,770
I'm here

488
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,620
to snowboard with you guys.

489
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,770
I took an extra-long vacation.

490
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,940
Look, I even brought my skis.

491
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,660
Awesome. Welcome.

492
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,420
Let's go.

493
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,810
Let's go.

494
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,700
How have you been?

495
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,290
Pretty good.

496
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,380
Are you settling in okay?

497
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,570
What do you think?

498
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,240
[Filmed in a safe setting]

499
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,730
Zhi,

500
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,050
you're so good to me.

501
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm so touched that you came

502
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,460
to pick me up yourself.

503
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,090
Zhi came for me,

504
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,900
not you.

505
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,620
How would you know?

506
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,180
You didn't even tell her

507
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,140
you were coming.

508
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,620
I told her there'd be

509
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,530
a surprise.

510
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,090
Zhi and I have a special bond.

511
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,250
She must've figured it out.

512
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,220
Right, Zhi?

513
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,900
You knew I was coming, didn't you?

514
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,290
Nope.

515
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,180
That's even better!

516
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,940
It wouldn't be a surprise if you did.

517
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,250
Girl,

518
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,420
hang in there.

519
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,330
Focus on the road.

520
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,530
Zhi,

521
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,090
are we staying at the same hotel?

522
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,420
I think so.

523
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,900
You guys go check in first.

524
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,980
I'll take care of the luggage.

525
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,810
Alright.

526
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,250
The rooms here aren't that big.

527
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,330
Are you sure you want to stay here?

528
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,940
It's just for a few days.

529
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,490
No big deal.

530
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,010
Besides,

531
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,860
aren't you guys heading

532
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,980
to Lezhou soon anyway?

533
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,140
Master said

534
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,420
that when we get to Lezhou,

535
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,490
he'll rent a small place

536
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,660
so everyone can stay together.

537
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,900
Alright.

538
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,180
By the way,

539
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,810
what's your plan

540
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,940
with Yan?

541
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,980
What do you mean?

542
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,660
Won't it be awkward

543
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,490
if you two meet?

544
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,570
Did he mention me?

545
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,980
Not really.

546
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,980
But it felt like he was

547
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,290
deliberately avoiding the topic.

548
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,180
You've got enough on your plate.

549
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,460
Stop worrying about me.

550
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,180
Good point.

551
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,420
Did my mom

552
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,140
ask you

553
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,010
to tell me anything?

554
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,460
Why are you asking me?

555
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,290
Can't you ask her yourself?

556
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,090
She blocked me.

557
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,140
And my dad

558
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,660
blocked me, too.

559
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,330
It was definitely her doing.

560
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,250
You and your mom have been

561
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,900
playing mind games for years.

562
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,180
Do you really think

563
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,180
running away is the solution?

564
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,250
Had Jiang Yiming not stepped in

565
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,250
kept a straight face,

566
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,900
and smoothed things over,

567
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,180
she'd probably be

568
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,530
holding global auditions right now

569
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,940
for someone to stand in for you

570
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,860
and get married on your behalf.

571
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,330
What did he say?

572
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,290
He told her you two had planned

573
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,140
a trip together ages ago,

574
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,050
but he was tied up

575
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,860
with work

576
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,940
and had to leave a little later.

577
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,330
Only then

578
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,660
did she start to calm down.

579
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,250
I owe Yiming big time.

580
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,530
It must've been a hassle

581
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,940
for him to come all the way here.

582
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,010
A trip to Xicheng is nothing.

583
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,010
He literally moved back

584
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,810
from Germany for you.

585
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,860
He is

586
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,380
a bit goofy and over the top,

587
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,660
but honestly, I don't think

588
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,380
you're much better.

589
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,490
I'm nothing like him.

590
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,140
Didn't you also come all the way

591
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,700
to Xicheng for someone?

592
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,980
I didn't.

593
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,860
I came for my career.

594
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,420
Okay.

595
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,940
Zhi,

596
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,900
are you hungry?

597
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,530
Let's grab

598
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,420
something to eat later.

599
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,090
Oh, what a cute puppy!

600
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,010
Look at me!

601
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,140
Go check in. Hurry.

602
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,980
Hi there.

603
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,860
Give him your ID.

604
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,770
Zhi,

605
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,050
any thoughts on dinner?

606
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,940
Are you even going to ask if I'm hungry?

607
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,810
Are you hungry, too?

608
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,420
We'll have dinner together.

609
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,290
Bye.

610
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,290
Master, where are you?

611
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,490
I'll give the car keys back to you.

612
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,900
Hotel gym.

613
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,940
Master,

614
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,140
Master...

615
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,380
thanks for the keys.

616
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,330
Did you pick her up?

617
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,290
Why didn't you

618
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,380
go to the slopes today?

619
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,730
I stayed up too late last night.

620
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,860
By the time I woke up, the snow had all been slushy,

621
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,620
so I didn't go.

622
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,940
I thought

623
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,770
all that snowboarding gave you that build.

624
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,620
I didn't know

625
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,090
you actually hit the gym, too.

626
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,730
Of course, snowboarding helps with weight loss.

627
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,330
But what you eat matters, too.

628
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,220
That sounds tough.

629
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,980
Does that mean fat people can't snowboard?

630
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,980
Of course, they can.

631
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,290
Yan lost weight

632
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,490
through snowboarding.

633
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,900
Really?

634
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,180
I should learn a thing or two from him.

635
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,660
Bigger people

636
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,980
have the most potential.

637
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,570
I wonder

638
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,460
how he got that scar.

639
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,290
Could it be related to his sudden retirement?

640
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,250
Master,

641
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,050
that car...

642
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,810

Your sofa is so comfy.

Let me stay a bit longer.

651
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,220
Just a little longer.

652
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,940
I'll leave soon.

653
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,500

even the scar matches yours this time.

658
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,380
This is definitely not a coincidence.

How did she even know

you have a scar there?

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,940

We have to hit Aven Avenue one more time today.

681
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,970
For sure.

682
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,530
Let's go.

683
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,620
Master,

684
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,530
we'll grab a table first.

685
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,100
What do you want to drink?

686
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:15,770
Latte.

687
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,530
Same.

688
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,180
Got it.

689
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,860
What would you like?

690
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,730
Order three sandwiches for them, too.

Anything's fine.

692
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,210
You guys go sit down.

693
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,940
We'll bring the drinks over.

694
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,210
And two cups of hot water.

695
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,450
Hot water?

696
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,250
Are you on some health kick?

697
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,050
Yep.

698
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,210
Let's go grab a bite.

699
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,140
I'll put my board down first.

700
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,690

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,420
What's she doing here?

703
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,620
Is she here to snowboard

704
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,420
or build her follower count?

705
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,340
What do you think?

706
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,140
She's clearly here

707
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,100
for the photos.

708
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,490
Am I right?

709
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,450
She thinks throwing on

710
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,860
a flashy outfit and posing with a snowboard

711
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,380
makes her a snowboarding star.

715

It's normal to want to look good while snowboarding.

716

717
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,820

718
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,210
We didn't name names.

719
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,050

If you're going to gossip,

723
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,450
keep your voice down.

724
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,010
Wait,

725
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,100

726
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,180
Mind your own business.

729
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,660
and you're judging a girl's outfit like that?

730
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,660

731
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,250

Those guys

736
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,450
were

737
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,380
trash-talking

739
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,210

I always thought you were soft and sweet,

741
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,100
but you sure know how to stand your ground.

742
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,450
You're not bad yourself, Hua.

743
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,690

Oh, thanks.

Thanks for sticking up for me.

746
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,100
I know I'm just a newbie at snowboarding,

747
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,290
but how I dress

748
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,180
is my own choice, right?

749
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,820
Of course.

750
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,010
You look great in this outfit.

751
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,660
I love it.

752
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,140

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
are you coaching here in Xicheng?

755
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,490
Can my friends and I book

756
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,290
a session with you later?

757
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,900
Sorry.

758
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm just here to have fun.

759
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,900
Well, thanks for standing up

760
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,820
for my friend just now.

761
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,050
Let's compete fair and square from now on.

762
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,340
Thanks.

763
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,250
Bye-bye.

764
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,620
I'm starving.

765
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,660
I need food now!

766
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,380

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,530
Are you in a bad mood?

769
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,900
Not at all.

770
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,100
You're obviously upset.

771
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,690
Why do you care?

772
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,490
Go have your "fair competition" with Hu.

773
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,620
Master,

774
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,970
I just didn't get what she meant

775
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,940
at the time.

776
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,820
I'm sorry.

777
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,140
Sorry for what?

778
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,580
I'm sorry

779
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,770
for hanging out with her friend

780
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,770
even though I knew

781
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,970
she had her eyes on you.

782
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,290
It was totally disrespectful

783
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,180
and out of line.

784
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,010
But don't worry.

785
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,140
Unlike Hu, I have

786
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,580
no ulterior motives

787
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,420
toward you!

788
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,490
You say that,

789
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,660
but your drawings tell a different story.

790
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,820
By the way, Master,

791
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,660
why did you

792
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,380
call me a genius last night?

793
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,730
What message did you retract?

794
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,660
Did you sneak

795
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,450
into my room to spy on me

796
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,010
for your comic?

797
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,450
What?

798
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,420
I did not!

799
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,180
You left the door wide open.

800
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,860
It's like you wanted people to look.

801
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,970
Oh, now you're

802
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,970
blaming the victim?

803
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,380
That's amazing.

804
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,580
He must be a pro, too.

805
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,820
Master,

806
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,100
can you do those moves?

807
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,820
Don't compare me to that kid.

808
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,730
Do you know him?

809
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,380
That's the guy

810
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,730
who competed against me in parallel giant slalom.

811
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,530
His name's Dai Duo.

812
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,380
You can recognize him just from that?

813
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,100
With skills like that?

814
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,970
I'd recognize him even in a snowstorm.

815
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,250
Whatever you're thinking,

816
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,580
keep it to yourself.

817
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,250
Keep your head up.

818
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,100
Relax your upper body.

819
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,340
Look straight ahead.

820
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,180
That's it.

821
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,970
Zhi,

822
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,570
don't be scared.

823
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,780
I've come to your rescue.

824
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,700
Is this your friend?

825
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,530
Yeah, he's also Jiang Nanfeng's brother.

826
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,700
Hi,

827
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,740
I'm Jiang Yiming.

828
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,170
Zhi and I grew up together.

829
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,010
You're her coach, right?

830
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,090
My sister told me about you.

831
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,090
I really need to thank you.

832
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,340
Zhi has always

833
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,780
been quiet and delicate.

834
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,170
When I heard she was learning snowboarding,

835
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,170
I nearly had a heart attack!

836
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,450
Good thing she has you

837
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,860
to teach her and keep her safe.

838
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,700
Otherwise,

839
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,570
it would've been so dangerous.

840
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,570
Zhi,

841
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,860
let me take you down the slope.

842
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,490
It's fine. I got this.

843
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,050
I can do it myself.

844
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,130
Don't be shy.

845
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,170
It's fine.

846
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,090
I'll slide down by myself.

847
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,610
Coach,

848
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,860
let's go down together.

849
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,090
I'll ski

850
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,170
in between you two.

851
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,010
They always say snowboarders

852
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,170
should have a skier friend.

853
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,450
The more friends, the smoother the ride.

854
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:04,940
Let's go.

855
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,610
No, thanks.

856
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,610
Coach, you're incredible!

857
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,820
He's a true pro, right?

858
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,170
Come on, Zhi.

859
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,380
I'll take you down.

860
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,170
Alright.

861
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,090
Be careful.

862
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,940
Take it easy.

863
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,260
Thanks, Yiming.

864
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,900
No need to thank me.

865
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,340
You're standing like a crooked tree.

866
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,050
Is that what I taught you?

867
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,170
You can't even stand properly.

868
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,220
Align your shoulders

869
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,090
with the board.

870
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,740
Look straight ahead.

871
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,490
Look ahead.

872
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,940
Don't crane

873
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,130
your neck forward like a turtle!

874
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,380
Zhi,

875
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,530
that stance

876
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,380
really goes well

877
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,090
with your turtle pad.

878
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,220
Is your board stuck or what?

879
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,130
Move it.

880
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,860
That's it, Zhi!

881
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,420
You're killing it!

882
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,700
Bravo!

883
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,940
I'm so proud of you!

884
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,570
Zhi, I can't stop!

885
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,090
Wait for me. I'll be back in a minute!

886
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,260
Be careful!

887
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,740
Wait for me!

888
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,420
Your boyfriend, huh?

889
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,530
You look so nervous.

890
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,420
He's not my boyfriend.

891
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,610
You two seem close.

892
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,860
If he's not your boyfriend, what is he?

893
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,940
He's not my boyfriend.

894
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,570
Keep messing up your form,

895
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,010
and I won't be your coach anymore.

896
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,260
Even if you're not my coach,

897
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,970
you'll still be my master.

898
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,570
Back to practice.

899
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,860
See you at the bottom.

900
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,300
I'm way too fast for you!

901
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,970
Shoulders parallel with the board.

902
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,900
The snow's great today.

903
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,650
Look ahead!

904
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,260
I am!

905
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,490
I'm so sleepy.

906
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,340
Two coffees, same as usual.

907
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,260
Got it.

908
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,900
Thanks.

909
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,220
Do you still have sessions later?

910
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,090
Yeah, one more.

911
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,530
Seriously?

912
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,300
I need to make money, bro.

913
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,170
Remember to send me

914
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,170
the slide deck.

915
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,380
Alright, talk later.

916
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,010
Where's Wei Zhi?

917
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,170
On the slopes,

918
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,570
practicing with Master.

919
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,650
Your senior's here.

920
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,650
Aren't you going to coach her?

921
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,900
Hi there, Senior.

922
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,580
[Senior, Send a friend request to chat]

923
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,170
Yesterday, when Zhi borrowed

924
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,450
Chong's car to pick you up from the airport,

925
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,780
Beici asked me

926
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,490
why I didn't

927
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,010
go pick you up

928
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,860
myself.

929
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,610
Do you think I should've gone instead?

930
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,820
Did you even ask Wei Zhi

931
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,050
what really happened?

932
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,260
There, I've added you.

933
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,130
Give me a session tomorrow,

934
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,900
okay?

935
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,450
Okay.

936
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,050
Zhi,

937
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,090
you're crushing it!

938
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,130
Control.

939
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,700
It's all about control!

940
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,090
Coach,

941
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,340
isn't Zhi

942
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,300
making crazy progress?

943
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,170
She's quite promising

944
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,860
at snowboarding?

945
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,570
She might as well give up.

946
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,420
You...!

947
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,340
I wouldn't mind.

948
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,490
Even if she quits,

949
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,130
I'll love her just the same.

950
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,380
Are you hungry?

951
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,340
How about whole roasted lamb for dinner?

952
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,220
My treat.

953
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,970
We'll invite everyone.

954
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,700
Consider it a welcome dinner for Nanfeng.

955
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,220
Okay.

956
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,090
Great idea.

957
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,420
Roasted lamb it is.

958
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,220
A proper, authentic roasted lamb feast!

959
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,860
Let's go.

960
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,700
No one's talking.

961
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,170
It feels like we're on a pilgrimage.

962
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,700
Yeah.

963
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,090
Do you want the lamb mild or medium?

964
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,490
Roasted lamb just needs cumin.

965
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,380
Dance!

966
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,940
Dance!

967
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,940
Nice!

968
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,900
Enjoy your meal.

969
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,530
Thank you.

970
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,450
Thanks.

971
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,820
Oh, roasted lamb!

972
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,740
Come on, let's toast to the lamb!

973
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,820
Nanfeng, sit over there.

974
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,650
I'll sit here

975
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,700
and take care of Zhi.

976
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,300
Don't.

977
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,300
Here, take your coat.

978
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,260
Just leave it there.

979
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,780
I know Zhi said

980
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,860
she's treating us tonight,

981
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,860
but I still

982
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,090
want to thank you all,

983
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,170
my new friends,

984
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,380
for being so welcoming

985
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,130
to my sister and me.

986
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,490
Moreover, I want

987
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,820
to thank you for taking care of Zhi.

988
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,220
If there's not enough food,

989
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,820
order whatever you like.

990
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,170
It's on me.

991
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,090
I hope you all enjoy your time in Xicheng.

992
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,090
Eat well, drink well, train well, and have fun.

993
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,650
If any of you ever visit Nancheng,

994
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,700
hit us up anytime.

995
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,700
Alright, cheers!

996
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,650
Thanks, Yiming!

997
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,650
Thanks, guys.

998
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,860
Who is this guy?

999
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,010
Why is he acting like he's

1000
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,220
so close to Zhi?

1001
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,970
No idea.

1002
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,610
Ask Master.

1003
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,050
He's her

1004
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,170
childhood sweetheart.

1005
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,970
Master,

1006
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,820
stop spreading rumors.

1007
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,610
No,

1008
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,340
that's not true!

1009
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,940
Zhi, here, have some beef.

1010
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,340
Yiming,

1011
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,260
I can serve myself.

1012
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,130
Yan,

1013
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,170
let's go slice up

1014
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,130
the roasted lamb.

1015
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,380
Alright.

1016
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,970
Let's go.

1017
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,820
I'll get you guys

1018
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,780
fresh pomegranate juice.

1019
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,340
Be right back.

1020
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,420
What's up, girl?

1021
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,220
What's the deal with you and Yan now?

1022
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,940
Fill me in.

1023
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,970
I don't want to make things awkward.

1024
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,740
We just set up a class for tomorrow morning.

1025
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,940
So you added him back?

1026
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,570
Yeah, we're adults.

1027
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,530
No need to hold grudges.

1028
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,340
How about a Lafite?

1029
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,420
Shut up.

1030
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,610
Would Yan...?

1031
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,380
Stop right there.

1032
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,050
I just want things

1033
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,780
to be less awkward

1034
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,570
when we all hang out.

1035
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,740
Yeah, right.

1036
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,170
Sorry to interrupt.

1037
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,450
I ran into Hua downstairs,

1038
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,700
and since you're all here,

1039
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,900
I thought I'd join.

1040
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,450
I hope I'm not intruding.

1041
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,340
Not at all.

1042
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,700
The more, the merrier.

1043
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,050
Thanks again for earlier today.

1044
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,450
Seriously, it's nothing.

1045
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,130
Those guys just had

1046
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,530
too much time on their hands.

1047
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,220
I love snowboarding fashion, too.

1048
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,420
The pants you wore earlier

1049
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,010
were gorgeous.

1050
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,090
Could you drop me a link?

1051
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,740
Sure.

1052
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,490
Let's add each other on WeChat.

1053
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:45,940
Sounds great.

1054
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,490
I've got tons of great snowboarding gear

1055
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,610
to share with everyone.

1056
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,170
Count me in.

1057
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,050
Add me, too.

1058
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,650
Sure.

1059
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,300
Would you like to dance?

1060
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,820
I'll add everyone one by one.

1061
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,300
Alright.

1062
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,530
"Fair competition," huh?

1063
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,340
From all corners of the world, we meet!

1064
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,300
Aren't we a bunch of social butterflies?

1065
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,130
We should hang out more.

1066
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,940
Sounds great.

1067
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,380
Sure.

1068
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,530
They're dancing again.

1069
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,570
Your brother is such an extrovert, a total Type E.

1070
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,820
Extrovert? No.

1071
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,650
He's a different kind of E.

1072
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,780
What kind?

1073
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,530
E for "embarrassment."

1074
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,860
That's what he is.

1075
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,220
Let's dance!

1076
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,260
That's enough drinking for you.

1077
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,050
Yan,

1078
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,610
can you coach Hu tomorrow?

1079
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,570
She knows some ground tricks,

1080
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,490
but she could use some pointers.

1081
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,170
Come on, Yan.

1082
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,260
We go way back.

1083
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,900
One lesson

1084
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,610
