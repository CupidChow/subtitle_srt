So, Zhao Keyan

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,460
isn't your name?

31
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,680
I've been

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
calling you that

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,360
for years,

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,480
silly pup.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,570
I adopted you from him,

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,250
made him my wingman,

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,970
and he spent years trying to date me.

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,480

150
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,530
I've already put them on.

151
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,700

172
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,280
Why did you have to cry?

173
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,780
Crying

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,340
is contagious.

175
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,260
I didn't cry.

176
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,410
I'm not crying.

It's the first day of the Spring Festival.

181

Here's a kiss

183
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,700

I'll be waiting for you.

185

I miss you.

187
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,820
So,

188
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,540
it's Chinese New Year's Eve

189
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,010
and the first day

190
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,300
I've been able to stand up.

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,420
Chong,

192
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,220

to you.

194
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,580
Look at her, bragging over a Coke.

195
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,580
No,

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,340
seriously,

197
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,860
thank you for everything

198
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,970
you did for my prostheses.

199
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,060
I'm

200
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,130
really grateful.

201
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,770
Alright.

202
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,650
Work hard on recuperating

203
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,340
and make it all worth it.

204
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,100
Of course.

205
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,540
Look at you.

206
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,130
You're just like your mom.

207
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,340
Tough on the outside, soft on the inside.

208
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,770
What are you talking about?

209
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,010
Don't act

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,130
like you don't fuss over things.

211
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,940
I was complimenting

212
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,460
you.

213
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,300
Come on.

214
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,370
Let's have a drink too.

215
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,340
Come on, honey.

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,540
Cheers.

217
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,460
What a lovely couple.

218
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,730
Can you not flirt in front

219
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,970
of us kids?

220
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,130
Hey, don't speak nonsense.

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,100
Watch your language, kiddo.

222
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,490
Exactly.

223
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,010
I'm too young for this.

224
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,580
Alright, let's eat.

225
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,180
Dig in.

226
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,060
Let's eat.

227
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,130
Try your dad's cooking.

228
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,340
What's the filling, Mom?

229
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,010
It smells amazing.

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,820
It's cabbage.

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,340
Dad, Mom,

232
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,300
there's something

233
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,820
I want

234
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,490
to talk to you about.

235
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,650
What is it?

236
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,940
I want to go back to the team

237
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,580
and continue training for Big Air.

238
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
Why are you

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,460
bringing this up now?

240
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,580
Mom...

241
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,770
Son,

242
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,700
I've been keeping these for you.

243
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,580
[National Youth Snowboarding Championship]

244
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,420
That's my boy!

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,610
Well done.

246
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm so proud of you.

247
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,580
Mom,

248
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,850
look at what I won!

249
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,490
Nice.

250
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,540
You've got flowers too?

251
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,420
You're amazing, Chong.

252
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,010
Come.

253
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,130
Come here. Tell me.

254
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,340
Who won

255
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,970
first place today?

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,700
I did!

257
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,250
Really?

258
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,340
That's incredible.

259
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,970
Mom,

260
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,940
when I grow up,

261
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,730
I want to be a snowboarder

262
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,940
like you and Dad

263
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,610
and win tons of medals!

264
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,060
Then you'll need

265
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,770
to train every day.

266
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,370
How about that?

267
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,370
Awesome!

268
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,820
Snowboarding is the best!

269
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:30,970
Son,

270
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,100
we've always known

271
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,970
what you wanted.

272
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,610
Think about it.

273
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,630
Our whole family

274
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,770
comes from ice and snow.

275
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,220
I even won

276
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,890
your mom's heart on the slopes.

277
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,130
That's just a fact.

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,220
Why be shy about it?

279
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,610
Anyway, we know

280
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,650
how you feel.

281
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,010
These past few years,

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,850
we were just

283
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,420
too worried about you getting hurt.

284
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,580
That's just how parents are.

285
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,770
Don't blame us.

286
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,370
But recently,

287
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,010
your mom and I

288
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,940
have thought it through.

289
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,890
We don't want you to live

290
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,650
with regrets.

291
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,610
Son,

292
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,540
since you've made up your mind,

293
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,700
go train hard

294
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,730
with Mr. Wang.

295
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,010
Work your way back to the team

296
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,580
and onto the big air you love.

297
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:39,970
Wait.

298
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,580
Wait.

299
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,180
Dad, Mom,

300
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,100
so you're really

301
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,540
okay with this?

302
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,090
Yes.

303
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,940
Absolutely.

304
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,220
But

305
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,820
you have to

306
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,580
promise me

307
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,060
you'll come back safe and sound.

308
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,580
Otherwise, I won't allow it.

309
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,970
Did you hear that?

310
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,540
Mom,

311
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,460
don't worry.

312
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
I'll bring back more, not less.

313
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,940
What are you talking about?

314
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,060
More of what? Less of what?

315
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,850
- Yeah. - What do you mean?

316
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,730
More medals!

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,010
More medals!

318
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,970
Now that's something

319
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,700
I can get behind!

320
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,480
Right?

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,940
Absolutely.

322
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,220
- Cheers. - Go for gold, Chong!

323
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:24,970
Cheers.

324
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,770
Absolutely!

325
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,100
- Happy Chinese New Year! - Happy Chinese New Year!

326
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,770
Happy Chinese New Year.

327
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,490
Happy Chinese New Year.

328
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,540
Alright, time to eat.

329
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,490
Yes, dig in.

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,300
The dumplings are getting cold.

331
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,850
Eat up, son.

332
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,180
I'll take out the trash.

333
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,850
Go ahead.

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,730
Dad, put on a jacket.

335
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,490
I'll be fine.

336
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,010
Zhi,

337
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,010
Happy Chinese New Year!

338
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,890
Hold on.

339
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,490
Let me find a quiet spot.

340
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,010
Happy Chinese New Year, Shan.

341
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,060
Did you get any red envelopes?

342
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,700
Yes, I did.

343
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,820
I have great news.

344
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,970
What is it?

345
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,730
Look at my legs!

346
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,730
That's amazing!

347
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,300
Congrats!

348
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,300
How do they feel?

349
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,060
They work like a charm.

350
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,610
That's great.

351
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,460
Let me show you my brother.

352
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,580
Do you want to say hi?

353
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,180
I'd rather not.

354
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,850
Then let me tell you

355
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,010
a little secret.

356
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,730
He's rejoining

357
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,610
the national team after the Spring Festival.

358
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,970
Are your parents okay with it?

359
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,420
Of course.

360
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,970

inviting him

363

as a guest presenter.

364
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,700
Well, congrats to him too.

365
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,460
Zhi,

366
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,060
Chong didn't

367
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,940
run away.

368
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,370
He just took

369
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,060
a step back

370
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,100
to give you both some space

371
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,850
so he could come back to you stronger.

372
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,970
So,

373
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,820
can you

374
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,130
wait for him

375
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,770
just a little longer?

376
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm hanging up now.

I didn't expect you to remember

582
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,370
I ever made you noodles.

583
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,100
I thought you'd forgotten everything.

584
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,540
It's getting late.

585
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,210
Let's go.

586
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,100
Pick up the pace! Stay in line!

587
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,980
Just two more laps. Push through!

588
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,850
Three kilometers in 11 minutes.

589
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,370
If you can't meet the standard,

590
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,780
no one can help you!

591
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,100
Move it!

592
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,820
Move!

593
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,930
Shan Chong,

594
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,650
control your breathing. Lengthen your stride.

595
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,370
You've got this.

596
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,850
You good?

597
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,060
Do you need me to wait for you?

598
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,100
Dai Duo,

599
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,100
you never run out of energy,

600
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,610
do you?

601
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,300
Fine, an extra three kilometers for you!

602
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,580
Hello, Director Zhang.

603
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,540
Thank you for taking the time to meet us.

604
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,340
We're here

605
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,590
to discuss the next steps

606
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,610
of our joint project.

607
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,060
No need to be so formal, Miss Jiang.

608
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,370
Come, have a seat.

609
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,300
Have a seat.

610
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,890
This is Zhao,

611
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,890
also a graduate of the University of Nancheng.

612
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,470
The two of us will be overseeing

613
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,130
this project together.

614
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,260
Hello, Director Zhang.

615
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,210
I'm Zhao Keyan.

616
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,450
Zhao Keyan?

617
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,130
You're Zhao Keyan?

618
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,410
No way.

619
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,060
I've met you before.

620
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,450
You looked different back then.

621
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,060
Well, I lost some weight

622
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,890
over the years.

623
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,400
He's incredibly determined

624
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,670
and always follows through.

625
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,540
I trust him completely.

626
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,690
In a way,

627
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,170
we're giving back

628
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,930
to our alma mater.

629
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,100
Director Zhang,

630
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,020
you know

631
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,430
our team specializes

632
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,500
in urban renewal projects.

633
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,100
We have extensive experience repurposing factories

634
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,100
into creative hubs.

635
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,060
We tailor our approach to suit each site's needs.

636
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,060
For the specifics

637
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,210
of this project,

638
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,410
I'll let Zhao walk you through them.

639
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,060
Alright.

640
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,450
Here, Director Zhang.

641
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,450
Take a look

642
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,890
at our proposal first.

643
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,520
It includes

644
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,450
outdoor

645
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,540
design plans,

646
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,410
several versions

647
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,370
of circulation plans,

648
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,450
and zoning blueprints.

649
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,340
You can go over these first,

650
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,580
and I'll explain the details.

651
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,930
No need to walk us out, sir.

652
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,890
Zhao will send you

653
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,640
the revised plans

654
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,370
once they're ready.

655
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:53,930
Sounds good.

656
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,580
I won't walk you out then.

657
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,100
No problem.

658
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,610
See you.

659
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,580
Goodbye.

660
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,540
See you.

661
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,410
Take care.

662
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm exhausted.

663
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,610
Wang has been

664
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,850
pushing us hard.

665
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,260
Are you tired already?

666
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,380
Look at Chong.

667
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,780
He's giving it his all

668
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,780
without a single complaint.

669
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,820
But Chong isn't like us.

670
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,830
We were all

671
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,330
fans of his as kids.

672
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,250
We all grew up watching him compete.

673
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,020
At the end of the day,

674
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,260
he's still human.

675
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,300
Everyone needs time

676
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,260
to adjust.

677
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,690
True.

678
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,740
He retired

679
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,740
at his peak.

680
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,450
He's back now,

681
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,210
but can he even pass the physical fitness test?

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,740
Who were you saying

683
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,060
can't pass the physical fitness test?

684
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,100
No,

685
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,210
I was talking about ranking up

686
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,020
in a game.

687
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,850
Ranking up?

688
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,930
That's odd.

689
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,980
With all the training lately,

690
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,170
you still have time for games?

691
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,930
That just means you're not

692
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,410
training hard enough.

693
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,610
Looks like

694
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,740
I'll have to tell Wang

695
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,890
to give you two extra practice.

696
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,100
Alright,

697
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,500
carry on with your chat.

698
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,890
So,

699
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,210
what did Wang

700
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,540
say to you this morning?

701
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,450
He's making me

702
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,980
a new training plan.

703
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,260
Are you

704
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,740
feeling down about that?

705
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,210
Come on.

706
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,650
Don't try to hide it.

707
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,740
I can tell right away.

708
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,740
You're definitely upset.

709
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,260
It's fine.

710
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,170
Didn't you just...?

711
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,500
What?

712
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,260
So you know we're eating?

713
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,610
If so, shut up and eat.

714
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,100
You go ahead.

715
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm full.

716
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,210
I was just trying to cheer you up.

717
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,410
Hey,

718
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,340
at least finish your meal.

719
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,300
You haven't even taken a bite.

720
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,340
Yan,

721
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,690
can you take care of the rest

722
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,450
of the final draft?

723
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,340
No problem. You go ahead.

724
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,370
I'll leave once I'm done.

725
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,060
Alright, bye.

726
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,540
Bye.

727
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,780
Miss Jiang.

728
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,300
Why are you still here?

729
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,300
Li asked me to proofread

730
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,060
a new proposal.

731
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,980
The client wants to see it tomorrow.

732
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,020
The one for the anniversary event?

733
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,890
Yeah.

734
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,410
That one's on a tight deadline.

735
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,930
Have you eaten?

736
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,930
Not yet.

737
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,980
Classic Li, making people work overtime

738
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,060
without even covering meals.

739
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,100
How about

740
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,780
grabbing dinner together later?

741
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,020
No need.

742
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,850
Go do your thing.

743
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,890
I just came to grab something.

744
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,850
I'm free after this.

745
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,340
I'll stay and help.

746
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,890
We'll get it done faster together.

747
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,540
Are you alright?

748
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,690
Should I take you to the infirmary?

749
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,380
I'm fine. I just tweaked my back a little.

750
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,540
Let's go to the infirmary.

751
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,010
Come on.

752
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,330
It's not that bad.

753
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,210
Not that bad?

754
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,610
Either you go on your own,

755
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,980
or I call Wang.

756
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,130
Pick one.

757
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,610
Bro, I'm begging you.

758
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,250
Let's go.

759
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:18,960
Come on.

760
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,610
Fine...

761
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,540
Unbelievable.

762
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,170
Does this hurt?

763
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:27,810
No.

764
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:34,940
Your arm.

765
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,130
How about now?

766
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,860
Does it hurt?

767
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,730
Song,

768
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,020
I just strained my back a little

769
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,940
during training.

770
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,330
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

771
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,690
Alright, let me check anyway.

772
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,250
This part hurts a bit.

773
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,580
What did you

774
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,500
tell me this morning?

775
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,380
I knew I shouldn't have believed you!

776
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,810
Why did you still tell him?

777
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,380
I didn't.

778
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,580
I called him.

779
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,250
He's fine.

780
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,330
Don't worry.

781
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,610
It's just a minor muscle strain.

782
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,020
Take it easy for the next couple of days.

783
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,020
I called you here

784
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,980
to catch him in the act

785
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,250
and make sure he doesn't sneak in extra training,

786
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,060
not to make a big fuss.

787
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,770
Does it look like he listens to me?

788
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,610
Well, you'd better.

789
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,130
There's something

790
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,130
I'm not sure if I should say.

791
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,060
Then maybe don't say it?

792
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,810
Sit down and listen!

793
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,810
The human body

794
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,290
is like a machine.

795
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,610
Wear and tear is inevitable.

796
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,210
If you're

797
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,940
feeling off

798
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,940
or tired,

799
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,860
it doesn't necessarily mean you're injured

800
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,940
or sick.

801
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,100
Relax.

802
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,580
Everyone

803
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,610
has their own pace.

804
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,540
You do, too.

805
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,980
So train

806
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,770
in a smart way,

807
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,380
follow your coach's plan,

808
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,540
and don't rush things.

809
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,460
You're not a teenager

810
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,020
anymore.

811
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,860
Thanks, Song.

812
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,020
Anytime.

813
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,650
Dai Duo,

814
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,130
head back first.

815
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,330
I need a word with Chong.

816
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,220
Let's go.

817
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,100
Thanks.

818
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,420
Do you regret coming back?

819
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,420
What about you?

820
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,250
Do you blame me?

821
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,380
Would you believe me if I said no?

822
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,500
As your coach, of course, I blamed you.

823
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,460
But I'm getting old now.

824
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,060
I've got parents to take care of

825
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,940
and kids to raise.

826
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,730
What should I blame you for?

827
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,130
For not wanting

828
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,170
your parents to worry?

829
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,210
For working hard

830
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,580
so your sister could get prostheses?

831
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,100
This is just how life plays out.

832
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,540
No point dwelling on it.

833
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,730
I get it.

834
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,730
No, you say you get it,

835
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,020
but you don't really believe it.

836
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,810
Training is more structured

837
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,210
than ever now.

838
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,540
Doing what's required is enough.

839
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,540
But you?

840
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,380
You keep pushing yourself

841
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,420
harder every day.

842
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,500
What if you get hurt?

843
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,060
Overtraining backfires.

844
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,860
I know that.

845
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,020
But training alongside these kids every day,

846
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,330
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pressure.

847
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,810
You know,

848
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,770
this bunch

849
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,610
of kids

850
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,540
always reminds me of you guys back in the day.

851
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,420
Yes,

852
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,900
they're improving fast,

853
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,900
but that's because training

854
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,380
has evolved.

855
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,460
The reason they're progressing so quickly

856
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,580
is because of you guys.

857
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,210
Your data

858
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,250
and your experience

859
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,560
paved the way

860
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,770
for them.

861
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,720
They have it easier

862
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,860
because you guys

863
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,690
took the hits first.

864
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,860
Got it.

865
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,810
Balance is key.

866
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,500
Now you're talking.

867
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,330
You've got the experience

868
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,610
and the skill.

869
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,540
So what

870
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,330
if your stamina isn't at its peak?

871
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,580
That doesn't change the fact

872
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,330
that you're one of the best in snowboarding.

873
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,770
It doesn't stop you from pushing forward

874
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,770
and making your country proud.

875
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,610
Do you believe in yourself?

876
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,060
Are you ready to fight?

877
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,690
Of course!

878
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,460
Do you want to win?

879
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,900
Of course!

880
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,460
Coach,

881
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,730
rest assured.

882
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,380
No...

883
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,290
Don't say that.

884
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,770
The moment you say that,

885
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,730
I start worrying even more.

886
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,860
How about

887
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,690
making a vow?

888
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,940
A vow?

889
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,380
Come on.

890
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,170
Swear on that light.

891
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,170
I swear on this old...

892
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,170
What did you say?

893
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,900
I swear on this big light

894
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,170
that I'll follow your plans from now on.

895
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,100
Good.

896
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,020
And if you don't?

897
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,980
If I don't,

898
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,330
you can...

899
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,540
If you don't,

900
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,380
you'll stay single forever.

901
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,940
How's that?

902
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,460
You little brat,

903
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,420
didn't I tell you not to come?

904
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,810
Think of it as walking a dog.

905
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,060
Right.

906
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:50,730
Walking a dog.

907
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,020
Who are you calling a dog?

908
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,580
So you admit it, huh?

909
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,810
Watch that back

910
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,570
of yours!

911
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,210
Slow down!

912
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,520
Oh no.

913
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,770
People

914
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,730
just love fighting fate,

915
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,020
never willing to accept it.

916
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,580
Thanks.

917
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,380
Are you done?

918
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,610
Almost.

919
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,460
I'm uploading it now.

920
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,210
Give it three to five minutes.

921
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,940
You did a great job on this.

922
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,380
This part right here

923
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,540
is really well done.

924
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,900
Really? Thanks.

925
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,980
Alright,

926
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,860
all set.

927
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,210
Let's go.

928
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,170
I'll treat you to a late-night meal.

929
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:38,970
Sounds good.

930
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,260
Pack up.

931
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,020
I'll wait for you outside.

932
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,540
Alright, I'll be right there.

933
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,760
This is really delicious.

934
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,210
There's a table over there.

935
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,210
Thanks.

936
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,610
Thank you.

937
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,740
[Ski into Love Episode 3]

938
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,860
Rumor has it that jumping over Moon Peak

939
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,020
will make one the king.

940
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,900
But in truth, no one knows

941
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,170
what happens

942
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,060
after the leap.

943
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,900
Will they soar to the moon,

944
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,330
land in the Dream Paradise,

945
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,330
or simply

946
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,500
fall into an endless abyss

947
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,940
after passing through that glowing ring?

948
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,380
No one knows.

949
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,220
Are you really going?

950
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,060
Your legs...

951
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,380
Don't look so worried!

952
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,580
What are you doing?

953
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,860
Stop stealing my lines!

954
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,580
How dare you waste food?

955
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,580
Thanks, I'm fully recovered!

956
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,730
I'm sorry.

957
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,380
But also, thank you.

958
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,330
I'm sorry.

959
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,060
Alright.

960
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,760
Time to visit Moon Peak.

961
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,650
Wait!

962
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,580
Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

963
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,650
For money,

964
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,690
fame,

965
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,500
or a future?

966
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,730
Maybe
