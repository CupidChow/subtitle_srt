[Rising Comic Artist, Zhai. First Individual Print Selling Now!!!]

194
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,770
Hello.

195
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,220
Miss Yun is over there.

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,770
I'm not looking for her.

197
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm looking for you.

198
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,580
Me?

199
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,130
I...

200
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
I love your comic

201
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,220
so, so much.

202
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,250
Well...

203
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,580
Can I get a signed sketch?

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Of course.

205
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,010
You...

206
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,770
You are so kind. Thank you.

207
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,180
You are the first reader

208
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,820
[Thanks for buying!]
who came to ask for my signed sketch.

209
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,580
I... I'm just a rookie.

210
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,220
May I know

211
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,850
how did you notice me?

212
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,770
Actually,

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,060
I've been

214
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,250
following you for a long time.

215
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,130
Before you signed with Tiger Comics,

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,060
I've already

217
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,850
read your webtoons.

218
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,100
Right now,

219
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,250
I can see that you're doing better.

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,370
After signing with a company,

221
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,850
you even published your own individual print comic books.

222
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,700
I'm really happy.

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,220
So, I must come and show my support.

224
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,420
Thank you.

225
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,370
Thank you so much.

226
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,730
Thank you, too.

227
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,420
Thank you, too.

228
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,700
Can I take a picture with you?

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,850
Of course.

230
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,850
Look here.

231
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,100
In that case,

232
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,650
you have contributed

233
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
to my achievements as a comic artist.

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,220
Really?

235
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,610
At the book signing event,

236
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,420
every other comic artist

237
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,820
had many readers,

238
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,420
but I had none at my booth.

239
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,220
I was wondering

240
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,180
if other people

241
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,700
didn't like my comic

242
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,530
and whether

243
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,220
I didn't have the talent as a comic artist.

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,490
I had doubts

245
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,130
if I was suitable

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,650
to become a comic artist or not.

247
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,940
Thankfully,

248
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,010
you appeared

249
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,980
and told me many encouraging words.

250
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,580
It gave me a lot of confidence.

251
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,700
Gosh.

252
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,180
I didn't expect

253
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,610
my presence

254
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,300
to have such an effect.

255
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,490
Miss Zhai, do you know?

256
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,580
Your comics

257
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,300
are very heart-warming.

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,610
I envy you a lot.

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,650
Since then,

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,250
I started to learn how to draw as well.

261
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,940
Not only do I hope my drawing

262
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,010
can heal my soul,

263
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,730
but I also hope it can heal others' as well.

264
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,220
That's great.

265
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,180
Let's do our best in the future.

266
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,770
All right.

267
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,370
Being influenced by a popular comic artist,

268
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,340
I'm sure

269
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,340
my growth will be significant.

270
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,060
However,

271
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,180
I need to

272
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,300
give you a heads-up.

273
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,530
Hobby and work

274
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,820
are different.

275
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,610
Trying to make a living

276
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,610
by drawing comics

277
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,980
is a little difficult.

278
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,250
When I started drawing comics,

279
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,130
I didn't make a lot of money for a long time.

280
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,730
Even after I had a team

281
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,650
and became the main artist,

282
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,980
I still couldn't make much money.

283
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,370
If you are a line artist or a colorist,

284
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,220
you'll make even less money.

285
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,130
So,

286
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,610
I always tell other people

287
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,890
that if you insist

288
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,180
on drawing comics,

289
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,370
you must have a strong passion.

290
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,460
However, all of these

291
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,650
sound plausible.

292
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,850
At least,

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,700
it's better

294
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,060
than having no income.

295
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,850
Shan Shan, you are so optimistic.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,300
Let me offer you a toast.

297
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,530
Cheers!

298
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,980
This black-hearted and unscrupulous boss

299
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,850
will soon be struck by lightning.

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,940
But why does

301
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,220
someone like him

302
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,610
want to join the comic industry?

303
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,610
He is probably

304
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,820
targeting the naivety

305
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,100
of people who learn how to draw comics like us.

306
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,940
Back then,

307
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,650
I thought I could draw anything

308
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,010
as long as I could join this industry.

309
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,130
Enduring some hardships and going through some struggles

310
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,100
are nothing much.

311
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,370
So, I just signed the contract

312
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,220
carelessly and cluelessly.

313
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,940
You weren't careless.

314
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,130
You are the world's

315
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,100
cutest

316
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,010
and most talented

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,820
Miss Zhai who is full of potential.

318
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,340
Thank you, Shan Shan.

319
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,580
I'm glad

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,490
to have a loyal fan like you.

321
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,530
Why are you smiling so happily?

322
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm so furious right now

323
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,300
that I'm about to explode.

324
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,700
All right. Don't be angry.

325
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,300
I'm no longer thinking about that.

326
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,300
However, I think

327
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,850
my priority now

328
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,340
is to produce some quality work.

329
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,180
I should put all my effort into my work

330
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,650
I can only prove myself

331
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,060
by producing quality work.

332
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,340
Action speaks louder than words.

333
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,370
Zhi,

334
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,980
you are right.

335
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,060
That's great.

336
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,010
I'm sure you can do it.

337
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,980
I will also

338
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,850
do my best to support you.

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,980
All right.

340
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,370
Let's forget about all the serious stuff.

341
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,650
What else is fun around here?

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,220
There aren't many tourist attractions

343
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,460
because this isn't a city

344
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,460
known for tourism.

345
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,460
However,

346
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,340
I know some beautiful

347
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,530
and fun places.

348
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,650
Perhaps it's due to nostalgia.

349
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,650
I don't know

350
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,460
if you will like it.

351
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,420
What's the place?

352
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,340
There's a forest near my house.

353
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,340
It's very beautiful.

354
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,580
My brother and I always went there to play

355
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,490
when we were children.

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,730
You can climb trees,

357
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,650
build snowmen,

358
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,770
and pluck black nightshade berries.

359
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,580
If you walk further down,

360
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,700
there's a river.

361
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,370
After it is frozen,

362
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,420
it'll be more interesting.

363
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,460
You can ride

364
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,770
on dog sleds,

365
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,180
play firecrackers on ice,

366
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,300
and ice skating.

367
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,850
It's very fun.

368
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,730
That sounds amazing.

369
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,980
I've never seen

370
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,300
a frozen river.

371
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,700
Why don't you stay for another day?

372
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,700
I'll take you there tomorrow.

373
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,580
We can visit the place

374
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,220
and take pictures.

375
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,490
All right.

376
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,420
Great!

377
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,100
Then,

378
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,300
I'll help you

379
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,490
find a homestay later.

380
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,490
Sure.

381
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,530
Thank you, Shan.

382
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,010
Let's go.

383
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,650
What's wrong?

384
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,890
I think

385
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,730
there's something wrong with my BMW.

386
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,130
Then...

387
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,730
should we find a place to fix it?

388
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,060
It's fine.

389
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,300
My brother is coming back.

390
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,250
He can fix this.

391
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,820
I should help you push it.

392
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,530
Let's go.

393
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,130
It's fixed.

394
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,530
Here it is.

395
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,700
This is the homestay

396
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,490
I told you about.

397
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,100
I'm close to the owner.

398
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,940
You'll be safe

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,010
if you stay here.

400
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,300
I would've let you stay with me

401
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,180
if my room

402
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,220
was bigger.

403
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,420
Thank you, Shan Shan.

404
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,340
You're welcome.

405
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,060
Hello, Mom.

406
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,850
I'm here.

407
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,250
I'm downstairs.

408
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,730
I'm here.

409
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,130
The way you lie to your mother

410
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,730
is just like me.

411
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm not lying.

412
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,700
I stay here.

413
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,770
This is my house.

414
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,250
This is my room.

415
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,530
You'll be staying here.

416
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,700
That's really convenient.

417
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,650
Yes.

418
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,010
Yan, I'm going home.

419
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,300
I won't see you at the moment.

420
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,850
I'll see you at Xicheng in the future.

421
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,340
Why so sudden?

Tell Zhang

423
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,490
I'll teach him how to ski

424
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,530
next season.

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,290

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,490

503
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,570
Where did you go racing?

504
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,460
I...

505
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,140
I...

506
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,980
Racing?

507
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,810
I was just

508
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,090
strolling around downstairs.

509
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,620
How did it end up like this after a stroll?

510
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,860
Here, Chong.

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,620
Have a bite.

512
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,460
Fix it nicely

513
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,530
so that it's as good as new.

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,660

517
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,700
Fix it nicely.

518
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,530
I'm going to check your work later.

519
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,620
Miss Zhai,

520
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,460
after passing this suspension bridge,

521
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,420
the cottonwood forest is right in front.

522
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,620
It is my brother's and my secret base.

523
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,460
Your BMW

524
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,620
is working well again today.

525
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,490
Of course.

526
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,380
My brother spent the whole night fixing it for me.

527
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,050
Miss Zhai, look.

528
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,940
When I was little,

529
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,660
I always

530
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,980
played with my brother in this stream.

531
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,660
That forest as well.

532
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,050
Look at that forest.

533
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,730
Once,

534
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,900
I had a huge quarrel

535
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,140
with my brother.

536
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,940
Later, I ran away from home

537
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,050
and went there.

538
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,090
I got lost that night

539
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,380
and my brother came to find me.

540
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,220
When my brother found me,

541
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,900
he cried.

542
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,140
He cried as well?

543
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,010
Your brother sure loves you a lot.

544
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,290
When he loves me, he loves me a lot,

545
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,530
but when it comes to hating me, he hates me a lot, too.

546
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,900
Both of us

547
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,700
love and hate each other.

548
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,140
I always make him angry.

549
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,810
Where are you?

550
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,900
We are in the cottonwood forest.

551
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,490
You've been

552
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,220
mentioning your brother in the last few days.

553
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,660
I envy you.

554
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,620
I've always wanted a brother

555
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,460
who can play with me and take care of me.

556
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,050
Having a brother

557
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,220
is a love-hate relationship.

558
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,530
We make each other angry.

559
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,860
There's nothing to envy.

560
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,290
Quick. A ten-second timer.

561
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,570
A ten-second timer.

562
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,250
All right.

563
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,810
Five, four, three, two, one.

564
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,220
It's so pretty.

565
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,860
Miss Zhai,

566
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,220
This is our second picture together

567
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,250
in our lives.

568
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,010
Yes.

569
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,290
Look. We are so cute.

570
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,490
Let me see

571
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,570
if there are any places we can take pictures.

572
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,250
Over there.

573
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,220
There's a squirrel over there!

574
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,140
Where?

575
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,180
There.

576
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,730
It's above the rock near the tree.

577
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,420
Did you take a picture of it?

578
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,900
I didn't.

579
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,530
I didn't catch it.

580
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,730
It ran away.

581
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,940
It's fine. I'll keep looking for it.

582
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,180
What?

583
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,980
You failed to recognize me again?

584
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,490
Chong.

585
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,940
Are you her brother?

586
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,490
Do you know each other?

587
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,050
Ask her.

588
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,420
Master.

589
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,490
Master?

590
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,380
We meet again.

591
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,330
Which nose

592
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,770
looks more like his?

593
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,460
The one with a high nose bridge, of course.

594
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,490
I think so, too.

595
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,180
Let me help you.

596
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,730
All right.

597
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,900
Are you done?

598
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,770
Almost.

599
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,490
- It resembles him so much! - So much.

600
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,050
It looks a lot like him.

601
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,570
No.

602
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,860
Do I have eyes of uneven sizes?

603
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,530
You do.

604
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,460
Why not?

605
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,420
Go back.

606
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,490
We can't build it anymore

607
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,290
if you move.

608
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,290
Go back.

609
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,490
Am I that fat?

610
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,330
Let me make your hair higher.

611
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,980
It looks more handsome that way.

612
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,660
Look at his teeth.

613
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,860
It looks a lot

614
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,810
like when he is angry.

615
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,380
He looks like this.

616
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,050
This snowman

617
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,420
looks quite fat.

618
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,810
It is twice his size.

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,220
Let me

620
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,940
make your pecs bigger.

621
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,250
He has pecs, too?

622
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,770
Chong!

623
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,010
Give me your phone.

624
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,490
Let me

625
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,700
take a picture of you

626
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,290
with your twin brother.

627
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,050
Quick.

628
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,770
Come here.

629
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,460
Lower.

630
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,770
Closer.

631
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,570
Yes.

632
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,940
Closer.

633
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,810
Yes. That's it.

634
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,050
What a wry smile.

635
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,770
Zhi.

636
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,180
Go there.

637
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,900
Let me take a picture of you both.

638
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,730
Us?

639
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,860
Come here.

640
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,530
Quick.

641
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,290
Zhi.

642
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,810
Stand closer.

643
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,530
Closer.

644
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,570
Closer.

645
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,330
All right. Lower.

646
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,090
Yes.

647
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,180
Smile.

648
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,490
Three, two, one.

649
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,530
Smile.

650
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,460
Three, two, one.

651
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,900
Zhi,

652
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,250
why do I feel like

653
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,290
you're getting more nervous?

654
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,290
Not at all.

655
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,570
We're almost done, right?

656
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,570
Almost.

657
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,490
Just one more.

658
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,380
A picture of all of us together.

659
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,250
Look here.

660
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,530
Three, two, one.

661
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,730
Another one.

662
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,980
Three, two, one.

663
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,460
It looks so good!

664
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,010
Chong,

665
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,250
send it to me later

666
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,420
so I can send it to Zhi.

667
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,980
We've added each other on WeChat.

668
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,700
Right.

669
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,090
Don't tell me you've deleted my contact as well.

670
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,660
That's impossible.

671
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,010
I'm not Jiang Nanfeng.

672
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,730
Done.

673
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,220
Zhi.

674
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,050
Here it is.

675
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,330
That is the place where my brother and I

676
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,010
used to play

677
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,140
when we were kids.

678
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,180
It looks exciting.

679
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,490
It's very fun.

680
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,290
Chong,

681
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,420
take me for a round.

682
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,620
No,

683
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,490
it's quite cold.

684
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,530
Fine.

685
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,620
What a spoiled brat.

686
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,570
Zhi, join me.

687
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,050
I...

688
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,810
I'm a little scared.

689
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,460

690
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:56,980

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,420
Thank you.

769
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,180
You're welcome.

770
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,250
Try it first.

771
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,140
Is it delicious?

772
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,180
Quick. You should try it too, Zhi.

773
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,660
I've paid.

774
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,210
There's more delicious food in front.

775
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,690
Do you want more?

776
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,380
Hello, Mom.

777
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,100
Are you going to eat this?

778
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,180
We are together.

779
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,290
We...

780
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,940
We are at the night market.

781
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,860
We are eating.

782
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,900
I also have a friend with me.

783
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,100
Really?

784
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,490
That's great.

785
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,380
Zhi,

786
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,660
my mother is inviting you

787
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,420
to our house for dinner.

788
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:25,940
Really?

789
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,490
Master,

790
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,010
can I have dinner at your house?

791
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,420
Fine by me.

792
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,900
Let's go!

793
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,290
All right!

794
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,490
Let's go home.

795
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,900
Dad!

796
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,620
Mom!

797
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,050
My friend is here!

798
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,140
All of you are back.

799
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,420
Welcome.

800
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,100
Hello, Mrs. Shan.

801
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,580
I don't know what drinks you want.

802
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,580
I have orange juice and hot tea.

803
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,490
Shan,

804
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,530
help your friend settle down.

805
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,140
Sure.

806
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,420
Make yourself at home.

807
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,250
Thank you, Mrs. Shan.

808
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,450
Chong, come here.

809
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,340
Help me get the dishes.

810
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,530
Let me help you.

811
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,860
Thank you, Zhi.

812
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,100
Zhi,

813
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,860
do you want tea or orange juice?

814
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,940
Anything's fine with me.

815
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,940
I'll pour you a glass of hot tea then.

816
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,340
Your house is so warm.

817
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,530
Every house here is the same.

818
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,730
Here.

819
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,530
Careful, it's hot.

820
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,340
Thank you.

821
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,620
Is that all?

822
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,140
That's all.

823
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,530
All right.

824
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,180
It's done.

825
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,940
Let's eat.

826
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,210
Go and eat.

827
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,620
Come. It's time to eat.

828
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,180
Come here.

829
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,690
- Sit. - Sit. Quick.

830
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,860
All right. Thank you, Mrs. Shan.

831
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,490
Thank you, Mr. Shan.

832
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,180
It's all right.

833
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,210
Dad. Mom.

834
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,490
Let me introduce her.

835
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,530
She is Wei Zhi.

836
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,820
She is my boss.

837
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,900
Your boss?

838
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,770
Not at all.

839
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,900
Just call me Zhi.

840
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,450
Zhi.

841
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,420
We only have

842
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,100
home-cooked meals here.

843
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,340
I hope it suits you.

844
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,860
It's a lavish meal already.

845
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,730
Thank you, Mrs. Shan.

846
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,290
Come and eat.

847
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,290
Let's eat.

848
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,100
Thank you, Master.

849
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,900
Master?

850
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,660
When I learned how to ski at Beishan,

851
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,050
Shan Chong was my coach.

852
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,420
I only noticed they are siblings

853
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,730
when I came here.

854
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,860
What a coincidence.

855
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,530
Yes.

856
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,940
This is what they meant

857
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,860
by a fated meeting.

858
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,700
How was my son's coaching?

859
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,820
He is

860
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,570
a great coach.

861
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,300
I almost thought

862
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,380
I could become a pro athlete

863
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,300
if I practiced

864
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,380
a few more days.

865
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,090
A professional sideslip athlete?

866
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,010
Just eat.

867
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,090
Don't speak ill of Miss Zhai.

868
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,380
That's enough.

869
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,260
Let's eat.

870
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,780
All of you must be hungry.

871
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,610
Eat.

872
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,260
Chong, get some dishes for Zhi.

873
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,940
I can do that myself.

874
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,490
What's wrong?

875
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,260
Does it not suit your taste?

876
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,900
No.

877
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,650
Let me get a glass of water.

878
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,570
Our son knows how to take care of people now.

879
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,610
Zhi.

880
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,900
Let me ask you.

881
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,090
When Shan Chong taught you,

882
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,380
did he bully you?

883
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,570
He...

884
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,650
Not at all.

885
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,740
He treated me well.

886
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,260
My son

887
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,300
is stubborn and hot-tempered.

888
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,300
He doesn't know

889
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,170
how to be caring.

890
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,530
I heard them say

891
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,820
that he was very strict

892
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,450
when he was teaching.

893
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,090
He always scolds the female students

894
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,050
and makes them cry.

895
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,010
I experienced that before.

896
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,010
Mom,

897
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,050
just eat.

898
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,050
He thinks I talk too much now.

899
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,010
I want to hear more about it.

900
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,300
Mrs. Shan, tell me more.

901
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,900
Zhi, let me tell you.

902
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,090
My brother is a fool.

903
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,450
When he was studying,

904
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,530
a female student

905
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,440
wrote him a love letter.

906
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,340
Not only

907
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,260
did he return the love letter,

908
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,460
but he also gave her a lecture,

909
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,700
telling her to study

910
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,660
and not fall in love at a young age.

911
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,500
Back then,

912
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,580
the little girl

913
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,260
was crying so badly.

914
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,660
My son is like me.

915
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,490
He's candid.

916
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,090
Candid?

917
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,970
Aren't you worried about him?

918
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,700
You're worried that your son

919
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,900
might not get a girlfriend.

920
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,970
That's your fault.

921
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,010
Exactly.

922
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,410
I'll just talk about

923
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,090
the people in this building.

924
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,570
Lei

925
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,530
and Hao

926
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,010
were both your classmates.

927
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,820
Look at their children.

928
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,700
Lei's second son

929
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,700
can already run.

930
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,130
Exactly.

931
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,860
All of them have a family of their own.

932
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,410
You are the only one

933
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,660
who flies here and there.

934
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,610
No girl is willing to date you like this.

935
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,700
Mom, you know nothing.

936
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,700
Chong has many admirers out there,

937
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,970
but he doesn't like them.

938
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,340
That's enough, Mom.

939
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,970
Eat.

940
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,300
You can't stop talking when you eat.

941
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,970
That's what I like to hear.

942
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,610
Chong, you don't

943
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,130
come back often.

944
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,010
Your mother

945
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,900
made all your favorite dishes.

946
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,900
Eat more.

947
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,050
Zhi,

948
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,970
you should eat more, too.

949
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,740
Eat.

950
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,010
Try this.

951
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,380
[MissyJi]

952
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,740
[Video Call, Voice Call]

953
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,660
I'm so hungry.

954
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,340
I wonder if any restaurants are still open.

955
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,570
Master.

956
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,970
It's so cold.

957
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,970
What are you doing?

958
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,610
It's so cold.

959
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,820
What are you doing?

960
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,010
I'm going to take a stroll.

961
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,490
You stroll looking all dressed up?

962
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,380
Let's go.

963
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,090
I'm hungry.

964
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,410
Let's have some hotpot.

965
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,490
Hotpot...

966
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,570
No need.

967
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,380
I had enough at your house.

968
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,010
How come I remember

969
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,860
someone only drank water

970
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,820
during dinner?

971
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,010
No way.

972
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm sure you made a mistake.

973
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,970
I ate a lot at your house.

974
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,490
Your mother's cooking was delicious.

975
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,220
Let's go.

976
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,340
I'll bring you to eat something warm.

977
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,010
Have some hot soup.

978
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,220
This restaurant's hotpot is light.

979
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,300
Try it.

980
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,220
Thank you.

981
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,530
It's delicious.

982
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,410
Meat, meat, meat.

983
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,820
Aren't you hungry?

984
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,740
Why are you not eating?

985
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,090
I'm the only one who's eating.

986
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,410
I'm eating.

987
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,220
Although you are full,

988
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,260
you can still eat more.

989
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,050
Master, come and take a look.

990
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,740
It's fireworks.

991
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:39,800
[Filmed in a safe environment. Do not attempt]

992
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,490
I've never watched fireworks for a long time.

993
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,260
I didn't expect you

994
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,050
to be a coach like this.

995
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,700
What's wrong?

996
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,860
Did your fantasy bubble burst?

997
00:39:59,360 --> 00:39:59,930
No.

998
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,130
When I first met you,

999
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,260
it was at the ski resort.

1000
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,130
That was another world.

1001
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,740
Another world that belongs to you.

1002
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,780
However, you've become

1003
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,570
someone who is in close contact with me

1004
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,220
in the last few days.

1005
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,450
You are Shan's brother.

1006
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,010
You'll laugh and play with her.

1007
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,220
You'll act coquettishly, too.

1008
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,410
Act coquettishly?

1009
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,450
Yes.

1010
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,490
Just like me.

1011
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,050
Your parents tease you until you are speechless.

1012
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,050
I think

1013
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,300
our lives

1014
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,660
are similar.

1015
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,340
Actually,

1016
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,130
the first time you met me

1017
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,180
wasn't at a ski resort.

1018
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,970
When was it then?

1019
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,700
Don't tell me.

1020
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,740
I'll think about it.

1021
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,060
[MissyJi, I'm done. Where are you?]
[I'm at Booth 32.]

1022
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,050
MissyJi.

1023
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,530
Are you 123?

1024
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,690
You bought

1025
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,740
my drawing tablet?

1026
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,850
What a coincidence.

1027
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,090
Nancheng Comic Convention.

1028
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,570
The drawing tablet purchase.

1029
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,530
Are you the one who bought

1030
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,490
the pirated signed sketch?

1031
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,370
Not bad.

1032
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,860
You still remember.

1033
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,820
Why didn't you tell me

1034
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,930
when we first met

1035
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,220
at the ski resort?

1036
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,450
Because I realized

1037
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,890
you are the comic artist

1038
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,050
whom Shan has admired for a long time.

1039
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:49,620
Moreover,

1040
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,620
ten minutes

1041
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,570
before you met me at the ski resort,

1042
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,930
you heartlessly rejected

1043
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,620
a young girl who was pursuing her dream

1044
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,300
in the comic industry.

1045
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,490
That person was my sister.

1046
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,010
So, I chose you.

1047
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,660
I see.

1048
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,970
You were

1049
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,260
purposely playing a prank on me.

1050
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,570
Did I?

1051
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,410
I'm sure you did.

1052
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,340
At least, I'm sure you did in the beginning.

1053
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,090
Anyway.

1054
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,450
However, the signed sketch

1055
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,700
wasn't truly pirated.

1056
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,010
After all, you are the real Zhai.

1057
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,930
Objectively speaking, it's not.

1058
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,780
Subjectively speaking,

1059
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,090
there was an intention to deceive,

1060
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,140
even though it was for Shan.

1061
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,660
Don't tell my sister.

1062
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,860
If she finds out,

1063
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,890
she won't forgive me.

1064
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,490
That depends on your performance.

1065
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,570
The fireworks look nice.

1066
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,890
I want to play with it, too.

1067
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:52,890
Fine.

1068
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,570
