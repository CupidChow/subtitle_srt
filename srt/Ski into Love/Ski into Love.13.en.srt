27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,980
[Adapted from Jinjiang Literature City's novel "Ski into Love" by Qing Mei]

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 13]

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,210
Shan lost her legs

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,290
because of me.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,380
My mom and dad were on the provincial team.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,490
I've loved skiing

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,490
since I was a kid.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,290
I remember

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,170
we took my sister skiing

36
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,060
when she couldn't even walk smoothly.

37
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,980
So I sometimes wonder

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,450
if her love of skiing

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,130
might be entirely because of me.

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,220
One more time.

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,010
Let's go.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,940
Sweetheart, get in the car.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,290
Let's go.

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,100
I regret it.

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,340
For countless days and nights,

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,570
I blame myself.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,450
Would the outcome

48
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,010
have been different

49
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,110
if I hadn't taken her skiing

50
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,940
as a child

51
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,340
or gotten her into it?

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,450
Growing up,

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,540
Shan made it

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,290
from the junior team

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,290
to the provincial team.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,940
I always believed that sooner or later,

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,660
she would make the national team

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,570
and be able to compete in the Winter Olympics

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,690
until she...

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,780
Dad.

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,500
Shan...

62
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,100
Is she okay?

63
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,850
Your sister...

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,140
lost her legs.

65
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,100
No one can predict the unexpected.

66
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,930
It's not your fault.

67
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,100
Some wounds can be stitched up,

68
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,100
scabbed over,

69
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,370
and healed,

70
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,490
but Shan's legs

71
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,410
will never heal again.

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,380
I wanted to give her the best prosthesis

73
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,340
to give her a normal life.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,930
We talk about her all the time.

75
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,980
What about you?

76
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,940
Have you thought about yourself?

77
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,610
What are your plans for the future?

78
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,290
Actually, after Shan's accident,

79
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,370
I had no intention of giving up.

80
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,900
I really resolved to retire

81
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,850
after my accident.

82
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,700
Shan had already become like that.

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,780
If I had another accident,

84
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,540
my parents wouldn't be able to take it.

85
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,780
I don't want them

86
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,410
to go through the same torture a second time.

87
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm sorry, Master,

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,730
for bringing up your sadness.

89
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,610
It's okay.

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
Actually, I want to thank you.

91
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,900
For what?

92
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,540
At first,

93
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,340
Shan always pretended

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,950
to be strong

95
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,460
and open-minded in front of me,

96
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,170
but I knew

97
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,140
she didn't want me to feel guilty

98
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,700
or our parents to worry.

99
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,650
She always hid alone in the middle of the night

100
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,820
and cried behind us,

101
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,440
but suddenly one day,

102
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,220
she told me

103
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,010
that she fell in love with comics,

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,370
found a new purpose in life,

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,130
and had her idol.

106
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,240
Since then,

107
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,820
her life has been full of color and motivation.

108
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,010
That idol she was talking about was you,

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,340
wasn't it?

110
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,320
I didn't realize

111
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,940
that my career

112
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,260
could really bring strength

113
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,300
to others.

114
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,120
You used to get caught up

115
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,770
in self-doubt and guilt,

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,060
so I hope you'll think more about yourself

117
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,340
from now on.

118
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,980
Master.

119
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,530
Would you like to come back to Big Air

120
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,250
if you had the chance?

121
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,250
Yes.

122
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,370
Even in a dream.

123
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,690
Since we know each other so well,

124
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,700
it wouldn't be awkward for us

125
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,010
to share one sleeping bag, right?

126
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,890
And

127
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,890
it's so cold outside now.

128
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,460
If we don't sleep in a sleeping bag,

129
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,890
we'll freeze to death.

130
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,940
I'll use my clothes as a pillow.

131
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,180
I'll go in first.

132
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,180

133
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,160
It's so warm inside.

134
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,100
Master, why don't you come in?

135
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,100
I've warmed it up.

136
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,730

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,580
Let me toast to you all.

384
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,490
Wait a minute.

385
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,290
Isn't Zhi with you?

386
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,970
That's right.

387
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,890
I've raised my glass.

388
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,290
Thank you all for your concern.

389
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,060
Come on.

390
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,900
- We'll drink as much as we want. - Thank you for your concern.

391
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,780
Master, do you need to drink all of it?

392
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,940
Master.

393
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Great, Shan Chong.

394
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,660
Come on. Let's eat.

395
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,700
Next, I'd like

396
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,890
to introduce this dish.

397
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,490
It's the sweet and sour egg noodles

398
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,100
that I made

399
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,930
with my heart and soul.

400
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,980
Try it.

401
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,660
You're so capable.

402
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,930
Come on, Beici.

403
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,480
The top one is yours.

404
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,610
Come on.

405
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,610
Thanks, Huayan.

406
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,090
Here you go.

407
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,770
Come on. Come on.

408
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,130
Come on, Yiming.

409
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:36,610
It's good.

410
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,130
It's too far away from you.

411
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,060
Come on.

412
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,810
Master, have a shrimp.

413
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,530
It's really good.

414
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,520
Among the boys I know,

415
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,500
there are two who can make instant noodles

416
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,220
this good.

417
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,380
You are one of them.

418
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,100
Really?

419
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,380
What's wrong with you?

420
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,770
Yan, is it that serious?

421
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,250
I'm fine.

422
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,220
I think

423
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,100
I might have gotten cold

424
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,760
from skiing yesterday,

425
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,650
so I've been sneezing.

426
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,530
Don't worry. I'll go take some medicine.

427
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,220
I'll be right back.

428
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,320
You're so boring.

429
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,500
Drink more hot water.

430
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,300
OK.

431
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,530
Beici has medicine in his bag.

432
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,140
Okay.

433
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,550
Come on, guys.

434
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,260
Let's have a toast.

435
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,020
Let's do it.

436
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,020
Drink more.

437
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,250
Tomorrow morning, we go skiing.

438
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,940
We'll be the first ones in.

439
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,140
- What for? - I'm going, too.

440
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,890
That's good.

441
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,350
Because when the slopes first open,

442
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,130
the snow will be spaghetti-shaped.

443
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,740
Spaghetti-shaped.

444
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,570
We'll go together.

445
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,770
Let's do it.

446
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,220
Beici.

447
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,250
Fill me up.

448
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,930
No leftovers.

449
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,950
Finish this.

450
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,980
Of course. You don't know

451
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,590
how dangerous it was in an avalanche.

452
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,610
My master was buried under a snow mountain,

453
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,740
so I had to dig

454
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,460
with my bare hands.

455
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,500
Didn't you feel your hands getting cold?

456
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,610
What can I do?

457
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,890
Of course, I felt cold,

458
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,020
but I couldn't help it.

459
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,460
The first 15 minutes are the most precious.

460
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,700
Zhi,

461
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,650
you look weak,

462
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,370
but sometimes, you can be a heroine.

463
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,820
Of course.

464
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,980
Zhi is a big heroine.

465
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,370
Let's have a beer.

466
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,580
Let's do it.

467
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,410
Let's do it.

468
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,140
Cheers.

469
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,250
Welcome back.

470
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,300
Stop talking about us.

471
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,300
What about you guys?

472
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,050
How do you feel about riding?

473
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,210
Don't mention it. It really hurt.

474
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,300
The moment

475
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,770
I made contact with the earth,

476
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,890
I felt like my whole back was broken.

477
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,420
- Serves you right. - It really hurt.

478
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,140
It really hurt.

479
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,420
Do you have bone spurs?

480
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,930
Come on. Mulled wine.

481
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,090
Thank you.

482
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,300
Let me check for you.

483
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,050
Dr. Jiang, don't let him go.

484
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,140
The seventh bone joint.

485
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,890
Is it here?

486
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,300
I had a patient

487
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,170
with bone spurs before.

488
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,300
Speak normally.

489
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,090
Why are you yelling?

490
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,980
Don't make a move on me.

491
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,050
I didn't.

492
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,770
- It tickles. - Don't move.

493
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,740
- Don't move. - Don't drink too much.

494
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,020
Only drink one kind.

495
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,700
I just had one bottle.

496
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,210
Have you forgotten what you did at...

497
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,650
Come on.

498
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,250
Let me, an orthopedic surgeon, examine you.

499
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,100
Look.

500
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,340
Older people

501
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,660
get bone spurs,

502
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,660
as do younger athletes

503
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,300
and such,

504
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,250
so you need to prevent it

505
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,340
and strengthen your body

506
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,170
in general.

507
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,060
Especially for people like you

508
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,380
who have a lot of problems.

509
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,820
Hua.

510
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,170
Give me a glass of water.

511
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,970
Why are you here?

512
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,300
Since you're awake, take your medicine.

513
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,010
Take your temperature.

514
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,730
Let me do it myself.

515
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,260
Actually,

516
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,690
I'd like to tell you

517
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,860
that you're not only my college senior.

518
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,650
My eyes

519
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,140
have been chasing you

520
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,100
since high school.

521
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,010
Senior,

522
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,250
try your schoolmate's noodles.

523
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,210
It's famously delicious.

524
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:43,930
Okay.

525
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,930
I'll try it.

526
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,970
What's your name?

527
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,650
Zhao Keyan.

528
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,100
Zhao Keyan?

529
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,900
What a strange name.

530
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,380
Zhang.

531
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,450
Senior, it is Zhao.

532
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,300
Zhang, hello.

533
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,650
Do you know how to confess?

534
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,260
Time's up.

535
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,860
You still have a fever.

536
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,010
Sleep a little more.

537
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,410
If you're not better tomorrow,

538
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,220
we'll go to the hospital.

539
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,450
Okay.

540
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,450
I'm leaving.

541
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,300
Bye.

542
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,500
[Mr. Wang]

543
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,490
Mr. Wang.

544
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,090
Manman.

545
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,750
Take down a phone number.

546
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,610
173

547
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,530
0131

548
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,050
7689.

549
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,740
Mr. Wang, I wrote it down.

550
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,220
Whose call is this?

551
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,930
Just a moment.

552
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,090
Yu.

553
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,740
What was the name of the man you mentioned?

554
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,570
Shan Chong.

555
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,780
Shan Chong.

556
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,180
Shan Chong.

557
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,010
Call this man

558
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,010
and interview him.

559
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,490
Interview?

560
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,380
Interview about what?

561
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,050
Don't you want to draw a comic about snowboarding?

562
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,660
This guy is said

563
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,450
to be a retired snowboarder,

564
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,740
really amazing.

565
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,410
Interview him for material.

566
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,180
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

567
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,410
And Manman.

568
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,050
I'm having dinner with Mr. Yu.

569
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,260
Do you want to come over?

570
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,820
I'm good, Mr. Wang.

571
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,900
I'm still working on my manuscript.

572
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,930
Enjoy yourselves.

573
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,770

Okay.

575
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,350
Then hurry up

576
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,170
and call him.

577

[Interview outline]

580
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,450
Morning, guys.

581
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,490
Morning, Hua.

582
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,130
My head's about to explode.

583
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,870
- Am I still not sober? - Morning, Hua.

584
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,900
Are you going to blow up the kitchen?

585
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,820
By the way, where's my brother?

586
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,620
Is he awake?

587
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,560
I don't know.

588
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,950
He was gone

589
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,930
when I got up.

590
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,570
I don't know where he went.

591
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,390
Your brother is so funny.

592
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,930
What's wrong with him?

593
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,300
He's really nothing like you.

594
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,890
Yesterday, he chatted from the college application

595
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,260
to operating on patients.

596
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,050
He also said Beici had a bone spur

597
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,480
in his back.

598
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,760
He even set your bones,

599
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,330
didn't he?

600
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,050
Yes.

601
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,840
Yesterday, he gave me physical therapy all night,

602
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,380
but I must say I'm quite comfortable now.

603
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,570
My brother's been like this

604
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,780
since he was a kid.

605
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,780
Like what?

606
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,900
A chatterbox since then.

607
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,900
And still the same now.

608
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,970
- Where have you been? - Making breakfast?

609
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,380
I went to the river for a while this morning.

610
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,370
On my way back,

611
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,380
I saw a vegetable stall.

612
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,900
He was selling fresh vegetables,

613
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,660
so I bought some

614
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,860
to make you some breakfast.

615
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,180
Thank you.

616
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,060
Come on.

617
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,340
Where's Yan?

618
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,490
Is he better?

619
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,550
I don't know.

620
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,400
He's still asleep.

621
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,340
Tell him to drink

622
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,530
some of this honey water, too.

623
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,180
And eat a crumpet before he takes his medicine.

624
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,900
It won't hurt his stomach that way.

625
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,260
I think he might get better sooner

626
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,610
if you feed him yourself.

627
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:17,970
Why?

628
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,180
I don't owe him anything.

629
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,900
Where are Master and Zhi?

630
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,810
Why don't they come to breakfast?

631
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,850
They went to the ski store

632

early in the morning

633
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,820

635
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,690
They must be back by evening.

636

639
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,340
Yes. I'm fine now.

640
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,140
The others went to the town.

641

642
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,740

646
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,180
Beici, you've grown up.

647
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,890
I didn't think you'd give me honey water.

648

651

Why should I tell you earlier?

652
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,580
You're not the only one who has it.

653
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,700

No, but this horror movie is too scary.

669

How about this force?

670
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,140
You can push harder.

671
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,970
Wait, Yiming.

672
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,700

I've been wanting to have a drink with you.

690

691
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,860
leave her home.

692

I think she really felt happy.

693
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,300
Zhi is actually a very kind

694
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,090

695
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,620
