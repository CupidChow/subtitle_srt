27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,980
[Adapted from Jinjiang Literature City's novel "Ski into Love" by Qing Mei]

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 4]

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,460
Master.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,570
What kind of compensation

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,850
do you want for that snowboard?

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,020
Think about it.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,380
Maybe

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,900
I can make you the lead in my story.

35
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,180
Last time I mentioned this, you didn't pick up on it,

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,180
so are you disgusted that you're not the hero?

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,460
Seriously,

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,820
I can draw you very handsomely.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,690
You can tell me

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,620
if you have any moves

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,460
you want to challenge.

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,740
I can do it for you.

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,450
I probably wouldn't like skiing

44
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,460
so much

45
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,980
if I could do anything

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,850
I wanted.

47
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,010
Like challenging?

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,060
Master.

49
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,610
Are you a Sagittarius?

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,410
You're not training this afternoon.

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,780
Go back and change your clothes.

52
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,290
I'll take you down to buy shoes.

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,340
What he can't do.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,410
What he couldn't even do in the comics.

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,610
After you eat.

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,380
Now.

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,690
I've noticed since you've been here,

58
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,290
you really don't

59
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,450
stop eating,

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,290
and you eat everything.

61
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,540
I can't help it.

62
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,290
You don't know

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,850
that I've been consuming so much these days,

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,010
so I've been eating a lot.

65
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,130
My WeRun step count

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,290
hit 20,000 yesterday.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,540
So impressive?

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,730
Be careful.

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,100
You still need to go back to Nancheng.

70
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,850
Don't end up

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,980
with a lot of fat

72
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,660
instead

73
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,660
of inspiration.

74
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,690
Jiang Nanfeng.

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
How many times have I told you?

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,730
Don't be so hurtful with your words.

77
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,980
It's not fat

78
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,290
but swelling.

79
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,500
Swelling?

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,060
I think that's...

81
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,170
I saw the devil.

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,940
What's wrong?

83
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,980
Don't turn around.

84
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Don't move.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,940
What's going on?

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,820
Wu Manman.

87
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,980
Wu Manman.

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,170
Why is she here?

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,570
Yeah. Why is she here?

90
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,820
Is she following you

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,410
and trying to kill you

92
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,610
to get your pen name for herself?

93
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,730
And who's that guy?

94
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,340
He doesn't look like a good guy.

95
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,500
An assassin sent by Wang Laohu?

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,450
Look outside.

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,170
It's freezing.

98
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,170
Wouldn't it make sense

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,660
to have a skiing accident?

100
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,780
Have you watched too many business war dramas?

101
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,450
Give me a smile.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,380
Real business wars

103
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,130
aren't even as good as my story.

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,660
Who are you asking?

105
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,690
When in doubt,

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,250
ask the locals.

107
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,410
I asked around.

108
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,370
She seems to be a writer

109
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,410
or a painter.

110
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,900
Anyway, she came to gather material

111
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,900
about skiing

112
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,660
and interviewed a couple of skiers.

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,610
She's here

114
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,370
to look for comic material.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,780
What material?

116
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,490
Skiing.

117
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,580
What else is there here

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,700
but skiing?

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,460
I've told you.

120
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,610
This woman has problems.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,100
Look. Right after your accident,

122
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,140
she became the fake Zhai.

123
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,540
Now, you're making progress on your comic,

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,700
and she's coming after you again.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,700
Maybe she's Wang Laohu's

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,290
undercover agent who's been with you

127
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,700
since the beginning.

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,140
That stupid woman.

129
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,810
Why do I think

130
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,370
this could be a coincidence?

131
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,290
Wu Manman has been working pretty hard.

132
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,170
Traveling and collecting material on the side

133
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,370
seems like something she would do.

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,660
How can there

135
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,810
be so many coincidences?

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,340
I'll ask her for you.

137
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,250
What are you going to ask?

138
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,850
Ask her

139
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,050
not to research this subject?

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,410
You have to know

141
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm the one

142
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,900
with the non-compete clause,

143
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,020
not her.

144
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,050
I think you're being bullied

145
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,540
every day because

146
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,290
you've been

147
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,810
so good

148
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,170
and disciplined.

149
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,810
It's only 2:40 p.m.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,370
Why are you so eager

151
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,610
and dressed up?

152
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,050
Jiang Nanfeng.

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,660
Don't you need to look at yourself?

154
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,460
The car is here so early, too.

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,140
Co-driver.

156
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,250
Get in.

157
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,370
Come on. Go ahead.

158
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,370
Let's go.

159
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,660
Further.

160
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,020
Okay.

161
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,780
Poke you.

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,540
You can't see me.

163
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,370
Poke you.

164
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,660
You can't see me.

165
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,900
Master.

166
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,220
Thank you for being so nice to me.

167
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,810
Yan,

168
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,700
is this film unidirectional?

169
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,290
Yes, it is. What's wrong?

170
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,610
Didn't you say you wanted to go to the restroom?

171
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,410
Not now.

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,050
Poke you.

173
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,290
You can't see me.

174
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,220
You can't see me.

175
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,780
Jiang Nanfeng, don't say it.

176
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,980
Okay. I won't.

177
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,610
Sit tight.

178
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,730
Give you a heart.

179
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,290
Sit tight.

180
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,410
Oh, my God.

181
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,460
All the skis here

182
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,900
are made of the same material.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,220
Your choice of ski

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,050
basically depends on the stiffness

185
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,580
or the size.

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,340
There's a 144

187
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,890
and a 152.

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,850
That's perfect for you.

189
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,250
I'll check out

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,100
the helmets and stuff.

191
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,730
That's a nice ski suit.

192
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,180
These are low-rise

193
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,940
and loose-fitting pants,

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,650
which means

195
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,220
that all the snow will fall

196
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,640
through the cracks in your waist

197
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,820
as you roll down the slopes.

198
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,100
You could catch a cold

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,100
or even get arthritis.

200
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,220
This is not for you.

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,980
According to you,

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,250
who are these non-snowproof backpacking pants

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,770
designed for?

204
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,530
People who don't fall.

205
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,940
- Hello, Yan. - So that's me.

206
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,650
Mr. Chong.

207
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,980
What's going on?

208
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,010
Why did you go down the mountain?

209
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm not leaving empty-handed.

210
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,250
Dai Duo just came

211
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,610
and bought a goggle here.

212
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,100
He said his previous one

213
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,130
was taken by a dog,

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,580
but how can there be dogs on the mountain?

215
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,300
Okay, as usual.

216
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,890
Just pick something

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,940
and then pay.

218
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,490
Ski jacket.

219
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,130
Face shield.

220
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,770
Gloves.

221
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,530
And helmet.

222
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,700
Do you need protective gear?

223
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,730
Do you need internal braces?

224
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,180
No, I'm good. I have a turtle.

225
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,180
A what?

226
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,370
That stuff is not a permanent solution.

227
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,060
It's not gonna protect you

228
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,650
when you're learning edge-switching

229
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,460
and falling all over the place.

230
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,250
You're still gonna need an internal brace.

231
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,300
Give me one of those.

232
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,980
OK.

233
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,180
That stuff?

234
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,370
Why do you call that so harshly?

235
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,940
How about this one?

236
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,100
The best-seller in my store.

237
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,940
Okay.

238
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,850
By the way, do you have any for sticking?

239
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,770
Very thoughtful.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,420
What size?

241
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,530
Why...

242
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,300
Why do we need to protect that area?

243
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,420
Small or medium?

244
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,820
Large. It's safer.

245
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,850
Stick this on your knee

246
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,300
and put on quick-dry pants.

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,530
Knee pads and ski pants

248
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,370
are foolproof.

249
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,610
Of course, I know that.

250
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,340
Is one enough?

251
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,460
Do you want a spare?

252
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,980
That's enough.

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,010
Chong.

254
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,370
What do you think of this helmet?

255
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,060
I'm coming.

256
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,610
Girl.

257
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,300
You're something.

258
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,340
Who is Mr. Chong?

259
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,610
God of Beishan.

260
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,490
The soul of the slope.

261
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,850
The top influencer in skiing marketing.

262
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,420
Do you know how many sponsors

263
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,770
clamor to give him outfits

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,850
while he doesn't even show up?

265
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,580
For a pair of 30-yuan silicone patches,

266
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,130
he personally runs over

267
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,730
and shops for you.

268
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,730
What does that tell you?

269
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,460
You're something.

270
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,530
Because I'm cute.

271
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,340
These shoes

272
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,130
look good.

273
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,940
They're too stiff

274
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,890
and better for carving

275
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,850
than for newbies.

276
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,250
Pick another one.

277
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,370
But...

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,180
But only these

279
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,010
appeal to me a bit.

280
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,890
With ski shoes, you have to pick the right one.

281
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,250
Don't focus on looks.

282
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,060
Master,

283
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,340
my professionalism

284
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,420
won't let me go near ugly things.

285
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,100
Yu, I'll get the stuff.

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,610
Huayan.

287
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,770
Master.

288
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,820
Why did you come down the mountain?

289
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm taking her to buy a pair of shoes.

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,100
You're the junior they mentioned?

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,580
You seem to be a good skier.

292
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,420
Really?

293
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,700
Thanks.

294
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,060
She means

295
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,700
you're falling-resistant.

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,940
Master.

297
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,420
Don't make

298
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,700
such anti-uniting remarks.

299
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,060
I bought a lot of gear.

300
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,940
Judge them for me.

301
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,890
Just pick

302
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,490
and wait for me.

303
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,730
Yan.

304
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,730
Take a look at the latest gear

305
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,300
I bought online.

306
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,060
You're amazing.

307
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,890
So extravagant.

308
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,460
Carving ski?

309
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,730
Are you switching?

310
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,820
Master.

311
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,060
Carving is a way

312
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,370
for me to relax

313
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,340
when I

314
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,730
can't master anything.

315
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,650
Don't you also have a carving ski?

316
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,530
Very good.

317
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,820
What are the mounting angles

318
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,010
for this carving ski retainer?

319
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,610
Mine seems to be 34° and 28°.

320
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,850
Then look

321
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,460
at my retainer.

322
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,300
How do I mount it?

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,610
If you want to do a carving,

324
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,770
you can turn down the angle a little bit.

325
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,730
Try it first.

326
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,340
If it doesn't work, I'll adjust it for you.

327
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,100
Here.

328
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,300
The stiffness of your skis

329
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,100
seems okay.

330
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,340
Yours are 34° and 28°.

331
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,350
What about mine?

332
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,980
- A little shorter in length. - What are they doing?

333
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,130
What carving skis?

334
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,650
Why do skis have names?

335
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,130
There are so many terms.

336
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,530
I don't get it.

337
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,370
You don't get it

338
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,700
and yet you listen so carefully.

339
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,940
I heard it by accident.

340
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,770
It seems I'm still far

341
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,820
from real skiing.

342
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,650
If I want to master this subject,

343
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,490
I have to understand it

344
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,530
more deeply.

345
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,530
Zhi.

346
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,530
Please.

347
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,530
The look on your face made me

348
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,770
think you'd fallen out of love,

349
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,100
but you're still talking about comics.

350
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,130
Out of love?

351
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,010
Now, there's a pretty girl

352
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,980
about to fall in love

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,180
with the man

354
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,650
of your dreams.

355
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,580
Don't talk nonsense.

356
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,370
Why do you say that?

357
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,220
But it seems to me

358
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,980
that your master

359
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,180
must have more than just you as a disciple.

360
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,530
They should have trained together for quite a long time,

361
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,580
so it's normal for them to be close.

362
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,530
Don't take it personally.

363
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,130
What are you talking about?

364
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,770
Yan.

365
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,700
The shoes that were sold out online.

366
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,010
Take a look.

367
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,890
Hua, you're so rich.

368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,890
Of course.

369
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,610
Huayan.

370
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,010
The shoes you ordered are 37.5.

371
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,530
No way.

372
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,650
My shoes are 38.5.

373
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,130
Yu.

374
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,850
Look.

375
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,420
Mine are 38.5,

376
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,890
but why are they 37.5?

377
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,820
How is that possible?

378
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,100
Look. 37.5.

379
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,890
Do you like it?

380
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,890
Does it appeal to you?

381
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,370
It's good.

382
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,580
That's it.

383
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,940
Master.

384
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,850
- I can... - I'll teach you ski jumping.

385
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,700
540°.

386
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,890
540°?

387
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,890
Really?

388
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,580
You're changing your attitude too fast,

389
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,300
Hua.

390
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,180
Those who can afford gold

391
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,820
will buy some oil, too.

392
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,860
540° may be more worthwhile.

393
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,340
I've been practicing for a year without any results,

394
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,460
so I need guidance from a master.

395
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,770
Come on, Zhi.

396
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,300
Here you go.

397
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,100
- Thank you, Hua. - No, I should thank you.

398
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,890
Thank you, Master.

399
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,340
Please stop.

400
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,130
I'm not dead.

401
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,060
I can't stop.

402
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,220
I have to learn 540°.

403
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,610
Can I start tomorrow?

404
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,890
In the morning or in the afternoon?

405
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,250
Both, OK?

406
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,220
By the way, Master.

407
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,850
I have a friend from Nancheng

408
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,490
who wants to come and learn skiing from you.

409
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,940
It's not easy for her to come all the way here.

410
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,940
Please teach her.

411
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,220
What's her level?

412
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,180
She can do boardslide.

413
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,650
360° is enough for her.

414
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,420
All right.

415
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,850
Let's go.

416
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,940
Let's pick out the gear for 540°.

417
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,300
Do you think your friend

418
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,940
will be angry?

419
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,460
But I have to tell you

420
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,730
Chong

421
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,370
has so many disciples

422
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,700
that not everyone can train

423
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,610
with him every day

424
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,010
after being apprenticed.

425
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,530
There is only one master,

426
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,250
so everyone clamors to take his class.

427
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,340
But in my opinion,

428
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,420
she might as well not be apprenticed.

429
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,300
Being apprenticed would mean being stood up,

430
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,700
so spending money might be easier for her.

431
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,650
Even if she has the money, that's still up

432
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,530
to whether Chong wants to take her.

433
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,130
You could just ask anyone

434
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,940
in this circle.

435
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,250
It's ridiculous for a newbie

436
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,090
who doesn't know anything

437
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,890
to pay Chong

438
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,460
for teaching her sideslip.

439
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,820
How good your master,

440
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,530
Shan Chong, is

441
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,850
has nothing to do with me.

442
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,700
I care more about what Wei Zhi thinks, okay?

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,650
That's between them.

444
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,530
Leave them alone,

445
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,980
but do you like

446
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,820
those shoes?

447
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,580
What?

448
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,980
Are you sponsored, too?

449
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,460
Listen.

450
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,130
In this park,

451
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,550
if you can find one person

452
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,420
who doesn't know me,

453
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,300
I'll cut off my head

454
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,890
and offer it to you.

455
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,580
Childish.

456
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,420
Are you guys hungry?

457
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,250
What do you guys want to eat?

458
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,130
Is copper hot pot okay?

459
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,460
The restaurant we went to

460
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,250
with Hua last time.

461
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,370
We'll go if you treat us.

462
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,100
Rebel.

463
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,370
How about it, Zhi?

464
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,730
I'm not hungry.

465
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,300
We can go to another restaurant.

466
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,340
You guys don't have to mind me.

467
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,610
I'm not hungry. You guys go eat.

468
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,580
Let's go.

469
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,300
Let's go.

470
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,420
What's going on?

471
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,010
What do you mean?

472
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,770
I mean, what's wrong with you?

473
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm not hungry,

474
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,460
so I don't want to eat.

475
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,940
By the way,

476
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,860
ski alone first tomorrow.

477
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,530
After I give Huayan a lesson,

478
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,220
I might have another one.

479
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,460
Master.

480
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,810
Can I ask you a question?

481
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,810
Can you ask me

482
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,980
if I want to buy a lesson

483
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,940
before you agree

484
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,180
to give it to someone else?

485
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,330
What kind of lessons?

486
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,010
Do you know how much

487
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,660
one of my lessons costs?

488
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,570
Zhi.

489
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,330
Chong charges for giving lessons

490
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,460
to other people,

491
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,660
but he gives them to us for free.

492
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,660
How righteous.

493
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,050
I'll send you

494
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,290
a reliable instructional video.

495
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,620
Practice on the intermediate slope alone first.

496
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,330
No need.

497
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,700
I'm going to another ski resort tomorrow.

498
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,810
I won't be here.

499
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,460
Don't go on the advanced slopes

500
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,730
if you're not familiar with them.

501
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,420
Thank you.

502
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,420
I'm leaving.

503
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,140
Give it to me. I'll do it.

504
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,770
I'm going, too.

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,330
Bye-bye.

506
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,010
Bye-bye.

507
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,820
[Butler]

508
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,060
[Cool!]

509
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,770
Wu Manman.

510
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,010
Let's talk.

511
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,290
Is the Farewell Song going well?

512
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,380
Why do you ask?

513
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,330
If you're having trouble,

514
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,700
- I can... - Forget it.

515
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,530
You're not the author of the Farewell Song anymore.

516
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,530
If I'm not the author,

517
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,010
are you?

518
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,010
I know you think

519
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,980
I stole your pen name,

520
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,700
but you know exactly

521
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,900
why you lost it all, don't you?

522
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,980
I've put all my heart and soul

523
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,090
into Farewell Song

524
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,290
since I've been in this business.

525
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,460
I really love Farewell Song.

526
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,220
I want

527
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,050
Farewell Song

528
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,090
to be a great addition to my resume,

529
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,940
so how can I give it up now?

530
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,180
If I don't take over,

531
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,250
Farewell Song will be left unfinished,

532
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,290
you know?

533
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,980
And Mr. Wang has told me.

534
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,220
He said

535
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,140
he back then

536
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,050
offered you a PR package,

537
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,530
but you insisted on leaving.

538
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,330
It was you.

539
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,330
You're the one who made

540
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,330
all our efforts go to waste.

541
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,660
You've failed us all.

542
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,660
Farewell Song was the work

543
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,090
we worked on together

544
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,900
and my whole effort,

545
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,250
so I wanted it to have a good ending

546
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,810
more than anyone else.

547
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,330
Even now,

548
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,220
I do.

549
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,010
What are you doing

550
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,810
here in Beishan?

551
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,290
For material.

552
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,900
The platform has an online contest for comics

553
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,010
based on ice and snow sports programs.

554
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,010
Voting is determined by popularity.

555
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,730
The winner is eligible

556
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,700
to have their work adapted into an anime.

557
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,570
Aren't you afraid I'll enter

558
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,090
and compete with you

559
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,090
when you tell me this?

560
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,220
I'm Zhai now.

561
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,700
I have a bit of a negative reputation,

562
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,770
but I'm never short

563
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,770
of popularity

564
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,620
or resources.

565
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,770
Tiger will give me

566
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,660
full support,

567
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,900
so why should I be afraid of you?

568
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,460
And I've felt it firsthand today.

569
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,770
I don't think

570
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,490
the ski

571
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,490
is a good subject,

572
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,900
so I'll leave

573
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,220
