to discuss anything,

162

better,

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,660
maybe the whole AI issue

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,340

as an editor,

185
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,020
you must feel

186
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,250
like you've let us down.

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm the author.

188
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,410
I share responsibility, too.

189
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,540

190
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,140
Let's not dwell on it.

191
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,340
Okay.

192
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,410
Alright.

193
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,340
Let's keep eating!

194
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,290
I can't wait

195
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,170
to sing!

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,610
Speaking of which,

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,370
I've never heard Zhi sing before.

198
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,490
I have!

199
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,580
Well?

200
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,050
Is she as good as she is at drawing?

201
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,170
The voice

202
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,050
of an angel.

203
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,050
Stop it! You will

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,460
hear my singing later!

205
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,930
Shan.

206
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,930
Let's eat.

207
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,930

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,580
keep your eyes on the direction you're going.

233
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,850
Keep your body parallel to the skis.

234
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,290
Don't lean your weight back.

Bye.

248
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,980
Tired?

249
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,100
Come on.

250
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,340
How's it?

251
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,770
Interesting?

252
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,060
Chong,

253
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,730
you can earn a lot via snowboarding,

254
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,010
right?

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,580
Why asking?

256
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,220
I want to make money.

257
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,850
Why?

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,180
I heard

259
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,850
that someone took his mom's money

260
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,700
to play games.

261
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,850
I just did it once.

262
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,980
Not even once.

263
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,820
Haven't you heard the saying,

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,580
"Don't do evil, even if it's small"?

265
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,340
None of your business.

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,340
Yes.

267
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,420
It's not my concern.

268
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,180
Your mom can discipline you,

269
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,060
but you don't listen to her.

270
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,250
Or,

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,980
want me to call your dad?

272
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,420
Don't mention him!

273
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,220
That man doesn't deserve to be my dad.

274
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,370
Fine.

275
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,250
I won't.

276
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,460
I won't.

277
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,060
Tell me the truth.

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,700
You skipped school

279
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,100
to play games.

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,940
Why?

281
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,370
You don't get it.

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,980
Playing games can earn money.

283
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,770
The internet is full of scams.

284
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,820
Be careful.

285
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,940
No,

286
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,580
once I get good,

287
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,980
I can be a pro player,

288
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,940
a coach,

289
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,060
or a streamer.

290
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,100
That all makes money.

291
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,130
Xuan,

292
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,700
at your age,

293
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,300
making money is not your responsibility.

294
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,420
Studying is.

295
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,130
Got it?

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,060
Forget it.

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,490
I won't lecture you.

298
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:37,890
Your mom

299
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,100
has probably said all this before.

300
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,700
But I can tell you something

301
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,940
she wouldn't say.

302
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,420
What?

303
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,180
A person

304
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,610
needs to have responsibility.

305
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,100
If you think

306
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,650
your dad is irresponsible

307
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,130
and doesn't deserve to be a good dad,

308
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,420
then don't be

309
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,340
like him.

310
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,730
I'm not.

311
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,370

I have to go.

351
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,650
My kid is waiting for me.

352
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,370
I've paid the bill.

353
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,730
Have fun.

354
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,770
Mr. Zhang,

355
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,770
join us.

356
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,460
Well...

357
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,420
Maybe

358
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,180
don't call me Mr. Zhang.

359
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,250
I don't deserve it.

360
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,730
Why?

361
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,980
In fact, from the very beginning,

362
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,220
you've known the truth,

363
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,010
right?

364
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,250
I know who it is.

365
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,100
But

366
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,100
if I tell the truth,

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,340
he will lose his job.

368
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,610
Thank you for understanding me.

369
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,890
He's a good father and a good husband.

370
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,730
He works alone to support his family.

371
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,300
He's been a good editor.

372
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,650
Without him,

373
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,300
I might

374
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,530
not have chosen this career.

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,980
So, you played games to make money?

376
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,850
Have you told your mom?

377
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,850
No, I haven't.

378
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,650
Why not?

379
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,340
The thing is not about saying

380
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,060
but doing.

381
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,770
I haven't made money yet.

382
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,100
Why should I tell her?

383
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,610
Fine.

384
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,530
Impressive.

Self-respect.

386
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,300
I know.

387
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,340
I was

388
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,220
at your age.

389
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,370
She told me nothing as well.

390
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,460
Since Zhi left,

391
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,730
she has often been bullied

392
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,820
at the office.

393
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,250
She thought I didn't know it.

394
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,980
But I can tell that.

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,820
I just don't want her to be worried

396
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,300
or bullied.

397
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,490
Xuan,

398
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,340
sorry.

399
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,850
Your mom didn't tell you

400
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,890
because she feared that she might hurt you.

401
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,940
But I know

402
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,850
she must love you so much.

403
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,490
I shouldn't tell you this.

404
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,370
I apologize.

405
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,730
It's fine.

406
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,490
You don't have to.

407
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,460
Be happy.

408
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,220
Smile.

409
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,730
Then, tell me.

410
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,180
Do you love your mom?

411
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,180
Yes.

412
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,370
I love her.

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,420
Louder.

414
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:41,820
I love her.

415
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,730
Okay.

416
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,980
Later, just tell your mom

417
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,650
the same.

418
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,580
No.

419
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,490
Why not?

420
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,250
Can you call your mom now

421
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,100
and tell her you love her?

422
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,610
Can you?

423
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,490
I can't.

424
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,700
Look,

425
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,890
you can't

426
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,940
even do that.

427
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,100
Fine.

428
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,010
Wait.

429
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,820
Just make a phone call.

430
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,300
Hi?

431
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,940
Mom.

432
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,370
Well...

433
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,370
Well...

434
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,490
Well...

435
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,010
I love you.

436
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,180
Kid,

437
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,100
are you playing

438
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,340
Truth or Dare?

439
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,460
I just want to tell you

440
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,820
I love you.

441
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,730
Nothing else.

442
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,220
I love you, too.

443
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,290
Take care of Shan.

444
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,330
Mom,

445
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,940
I have to go then.

446
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,180
Your turn.

447
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,180
No.

448
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,860
I can't do that.

449
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,460
Why are you avoiding it now?

450
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,010
Fine,

451
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,770
since you can't do that,

452
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,620
I have a way.

453
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,140
Meizi, it's fine.

454
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,010
In the future,

455
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,900
you may just draw at home.

456
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,980
I will pay you.

457
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,730
As for Xuan,

458
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,220
he's still young.

459
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,090
With proper education,

460
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,180
he will be alright.

461
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,380
Zhi,

462
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,380
thank you very much.

463
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,900
No problem.

464
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,860
That's what I want to do.

465
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,810

467
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,940
Xuan?

468
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,980
I love you.

469

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,420

471
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,660
What did you say?

472
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,660
I love you.

473
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,700
How did you make it?

474
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,180
Guess.

475
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,380
I have no idea.

I love you.

479
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,380
I love you, too.

480
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,730
It's my fault.

481
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,620
No,

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,660
in my mind,

483
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,660
you are always my precious son.

484
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,620
Good boy.

485
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,770
Thank you very much.

486
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,250
It's fine.

487
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,860
We'd love to help.

488
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,900
Xuan,

489
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,180
you should also

490
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,050
thank them.

491
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,250
I will take him home then.

492
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,490
Listen to your mom.

493
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,330
Let's go.

494
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,810
Bye.

495
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,940
Why is he totally changed?

496
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,980
He...

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,620

499
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,460

505
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,980

Apologize to the bear!

512
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,460
Bear, sorry.

513
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,660
Were you that bear?

514
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,620
Never expected that, huh?

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,980
Wait for me.

587
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,010
Heizi in two years,

588
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,940
hello.

589
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,050
By now,

590
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,860
you must have stood on the podium,

591
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,660
basking in everyone's cheers.

592
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,250
What?

593
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,730
No peeking!

594
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,770
I wasn't peeking!

595
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,290
Just...

596
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,380
A glance.

597
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,660
By then,

598
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,660
I'll be in the audience.

599
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,490
I'll be so proud

600
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,050
of you.

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,180
I knew it!

602
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,530
My boyfriend is amazing!

603
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,860
My taste is top-notch!

604
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,940
Choosing you is my best decision!

605
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,660
I knew

606
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,940
this day would come.

607
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,860
You work so hard

608
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,660
and you are skillful.

609
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,050
You're bound to win!

610
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,290
Bai,

611
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,860
by the time

612
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,980
you read this,

613
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,810
you should have already got your legs.

614
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,860
Stand up while reading it.

615
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,660
You just rolled your eyes, didn't you?

616
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,810
It's okay.

617
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,250
You look cute even when you do.

618
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,620
I don't know

619
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,900
if I've told you this before...

620
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,180
I don't think so.

621
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,570
What?

622
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,730
No peeking!

623
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,530
You just accused me!

624
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:04,980
I...

625
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,140
I wasn't peeking!

626
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,420
I'm done.

627
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,330
Hurry up!

628
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,050
I'll go look around.

629
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,900
I won't peek.

630
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,620
Well, I want to tell you

631
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,050
that I'm really happy

632
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,490
you can accept prostheses.

633
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,420
I'd still

634
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,860
love you in a wheelchair

635
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,460
forever,

636
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,570
but now

637
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,570
we can go further.

638
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,010
Everything

639
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,940
you missed out on,

640
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,860
we'll

641
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,220
make up for it.

642
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,250
What's wrong?

643
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,490
Are you crying?

644
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,250
No, I'm not.

645
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,770
Don't tell me

646
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,330
you got sand in your eyes.

647
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,330
No, I just...

648
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,050
Probably

649
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,700
I really got sand in my eyes.

650
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,090
Crybaby!

651
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,860
I will tell my brother about it.

652
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,860
No!

653
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,770
No, I...

654
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,770
Don't

655
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,770
tell Shan Chong about it! Got it?

656
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,980
Don't! Never!

657
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,810
He can never know it!

658
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,620
Fine.

659
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,900
I won't tell him.

660
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,250
I will say it secretly.

661
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,770
You...

662
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,220
You are even making me laugh!

663
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,140
I was kidding.

664
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,810
I won't tell him.

665
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,900
There there.

666
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,570
No...

667
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,140
Come on.

668
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,420
What's going on?

669
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,490
I don't want to leave you.

670
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,730
Because

671
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,460
tomorrow

672
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,330
I have to go back to the team.

673
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,180
It will take a very long time...

674
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,660
I can't even

675
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,900
go to the hospital with you.

676
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,460
Alright.

677
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,860
Silly, it's alright.

678
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,490
It's just

679
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,490
a check-up.

680
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,940
Not a big deal.

681
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,660
This year,

682
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,730
I may have to spend New Year

683
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,290
in Canada.

684
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,660
I can't be with you this time.

685
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,570
But you should

686
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,330
visit your parents anyway.

687
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,570
How about

688
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,730
I bring you

689
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,940
a gift from there?

690
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,140
Tell me

691
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,900
whatever you want.

692
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,420
I will bring it for you.

693
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,180
In this case,

694
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,530
I will tell you frankly.

695
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,050
Sneakers.

696
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,460
Sneakers?

697
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,140
Because when you come back,

698
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,900
I probably will have legs.

699
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,660
I want

700
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,380
to stand beside you.

701
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,700
Deal.

702
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,380
Pinky promise!

703
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,460
No take-backs.

704
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,770
Or I'll be a puppy.

705
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,700
Look, my hand

706
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,660
is much fairer than yours!

707
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,570
Does it matter?

708
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,660
What do you want?

709
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,250
Taking the letter.

710
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,380
What if you peek?

711
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,730
I don't need to peek

712
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,620
and I know it's for me.

713
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,250
Right?

714
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,460
The one you wrote is also for me.

715
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,250
Alright, give me that.

716
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,730
I won't read it.

717
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,860
Here you are then.

718
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,900
How could you do that?

719
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,010
I won't peek. I saw nothing.

720
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,730
Just kidding.

721
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,940
I'll go send them.

722
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,660
I told you

723
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,660
I couldn't eat that much.

724
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,380
Yet you bought me a lot!

725
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,330
Come on.

726
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,900
You always say you'll eat just a little,

727
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,530
then you finish

728
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,380
the whole pack!

729
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,460
Come on!

730
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,330
I never did that!

731
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,810
Alright?

732
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,330
Fine, you are always right.

733
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,180
Give me the key.

734
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,810
I don't want to say goodbye.

735
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,770
Me, neither.

736
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,250
But what can we do?

737
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,530
Your boyfriend is so outstanding

738
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,980
that he has to serve the country.

739
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,250
Well,

740
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,700
once your prostheses

741
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,250
are settled,

742
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,860
I'll find time

743
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,700
to come back,

744
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,180
okay?

745
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,220
Promise?

746
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,010
Promise.

747
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,180
Don't be rash.

748
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,490
Come in.

749
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,090
You are really nice to yourself.

750
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,250
You are doomed.

751
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,260
[Freeze Dried Strawberry]

752
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,380
Now you know being nice to me?

753
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,020
[Freeze Dried Strawberry]

754
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,220
Tell me.

755
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,010
If I hadn't caught you,

756
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,810
how long were you planning to keep it from me?

757
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,810
We weren't hiding it.

758
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,660
You just didn't notice.

759
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,420
Yeah, you didn't notice at all.

760
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,010
You can blame no one.

761
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,140
Watch your attitude!

762
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,090
Don't think

763
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,050
I don't know what's going on!

764
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,010
So, you knew it?

765
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,530
Then great!

766
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,570
Nothing left to talk about.

767
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,860
That's all!

768
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,180
Great?

769
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,570
No!

770
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,810
I don't approve!

771
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,330
Wait,

772
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,940
it doesn't matter.

773
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,460
My girlfriend's attitude matters!

774
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,810
Dai Duo!

775
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,620
Mind your attitude.

776
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,490
Do you want to get the approval

777
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,220
of Shan's brother or not?

778
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,860
Heard what your sister-in-law said?

779
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,010
Then,

780
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,980
what do you want me to do?

781
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,860
How about

782
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,730
swearing an oath?

783
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,810
Tell us

784
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,010
how much you love Shan.

785
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,420
Are you sincere enough to Shan?

786
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,090
How serious are you?

787
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,420
Let's hear it.

788
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,300
I swear,

789
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,380
from beginning to end,

790
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,820
I've been sincere and serious

791
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,490
to Shan.

792
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,490
No lies, no pretense.

793
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,420
No matter if it's now

794
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,010
or in the future,

795
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,610
I'll treat her with all my heart.

796
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,690
Shan,

797
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,940
I swear,

798
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,260
no matter if it's now

799
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,570
or in the future,

800
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,090
I'll listen to you

801
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,050
and do whatever you want.

802
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,010
You are always right.

803
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,010
No matter what it is,

804
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,650
I will do everything you want me to do.

805
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,940
Any time

806
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm not in training,

807
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,420
I'll be with you.

808
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,530
I'll support

809
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,650
your hobbies,

810
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,460
your dreams,

811
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,570
and the career you want.

812
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,820
I'll tolerate

813
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,420
your temper and moods.

814
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,650
Sure,

815
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,860
and your family,

816
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,610
I'll treat them

817
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,260
like my own.

818
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,210
As for your brother,

819
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,690
I will take care of him

820
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,900
like my own brother.

821
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,530
I don't need you to take care of me.

822
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,490
Brother!

823
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,490
You agreed?

824
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,860
That means yes.

825
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,490
You agreed?

826
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,170
Come on.

827
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,010
Brother, have strawberries.

828
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,610
If I find out

829
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,490
you pick on Shan,

830
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,170
I won't let you go easily.

831
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,610
No,

832
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,780
brother, you have no idea

833
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,490
who's the one being bullied.

834
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,570
Yes.

835
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,460
She's right.

836
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,650
He's right.

837
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,340
If we ever see you

838
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,210
make Shan unhappy,

839
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,780
I will team up with her,

840
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,610
put you in our comic,

841
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,460
and give you an ugly death.

842
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,690
Well said!

843
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,740
Sweet.

844
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,860
More strength!

845
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,340
Like this?

846
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,940

[Nancheng Lucina Hospital]

848

The results of ultrasound and CBC

849
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,170
are available now.

850
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,530
Two examinations left.

851
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,050
One requires registration

852
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,780
and waiting in line?

853
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,780
Yes, Doctor Jiang.

854
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,780
How long will the remaining tests take?

855
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,050
About 30 minutes.

856
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,740
It'll be done soon.

857
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,860
I'll leave the test reports with you.

858
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,530
Thank you.

859
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,050
Okay, Doctor Jiang.

860
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,610
Thanks.

861
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,610
It's even chilled!

862
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,340
Done?

863

How do you feel?

864
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,420
Not bad.

865
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,130
Have a drink.

866
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,090
Thanks, Zhi.

867
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,980
I have it.

868
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,900
Who are those two?

869
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,570
How do you feel?

870
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,900
They should be Zhi's friends.

871
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,300
You still have two more tests.

872
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,300
Have to wait for a while.

873
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,530
One examination

874
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,260
requires registration.

875
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,860
Shame, that girl is in a wheelchair

876
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,740
at such a young age.

877
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,530
Calm down.

878
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,340
Okay?

879
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,050

880
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,980
Just relax

881
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,530

882
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,210
Done.

883
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,460

Let's go.

885
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,530
Okay.

00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,170

887
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,740

00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,650
What brings you here?

890
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,420
I brought your dad for a routine health check-up.

891
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,260
I seem

892
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,460
to be the only one

893
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,820
who pays attention to his health.

894
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,900
Mrs. Wei, why didn't you

895
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,940
inform me?

896
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,050
I could make the arrangements.

897
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,610
Thank you, Yiming.

898
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,650
It's not a big deal.

899
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,980
Yeah.

900
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,490
We won't bother you with such a minor matter.

901
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,210
How come it's a minor matter?

902
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,300
And it's not troublesome.

903
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,610
I also arranged the check-up

904
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,300
for Zhi's friend.

905
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,130
It's convenient.

Hello, Mrs. Wei.

912

Hello, Mr. Wei.

913
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,380
- Hello. - Hello.

You may go on.

Zhi,

924
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,650
I have to say,

925
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,170
you hardly come

926
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,690
back home.

927
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,940
Now that your friends come from afar,

928
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,010
you should have at least invited them over.

929
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,340
Since Yiming is here as well,

930
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,780
just come home and have some soup.

931
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,650
Chong...

932
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,460
Chong What?

933
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,090
Mrs. Wei, I'm Shan Chong.

934
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,460

935
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,530
Why don't you join us for some soup then?

936
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,650
Shan Shan,

937
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,340
didn't you mention a few days ago

938
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,980
that you were eager to try

939
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,380
our traditional Nancheng soup?

940
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,090
I think I'd better not...

941
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,340
Since we're already here,

942
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,530
Shan,

943
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,010
let's go together.

Thank you then.

947
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,740
Not a big deal.

948
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,050
Come on.

949
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,460

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,090
Mrs. Wei,

I love the soup you make.

956
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,260
Talk about it later...

957
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,650
Sorry.

to show up like that.

960
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,610
You weren't prepared at all.

961
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,740
I should have brought some gifts

962
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,860
for them.

963
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,170
Oh,

964
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,820

965
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,530
from others.

966
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,860
How?

967
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,570
Hard to explain.
