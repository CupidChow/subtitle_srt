Why did you bring us

194
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,180
so much stuff when you came?

195
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,100
Just a side trip.

196
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,010
Yes. Wash your hands.

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,890
For me?

198
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,850
Is that awesome? I caught it myself.

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,890
You caught it yourself?

200
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,940
That's awesome.

201
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,180
I'll take you with me next time.

202
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,490
Then, let's catch some more.

203
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,370
You can catch as many as you want.

204
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,700
Are you and my brother at odds again?

205
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,940
We're not at odds.

206
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,220
Actually,

207
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,820
we're lifetime enemies.

208
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,250
Lifetime enemies?

209
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,650
That's funny.

210
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,370
What can you do?

211
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,610
After you come back to Hualing,

212
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,610
you guys still need to eat

213
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,300
at the same table.

214
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,370
Where's your coach? Why didn't he come?

215
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,650
He had some things to do,

216
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,010
but he's probably close by now.

217
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,180
Could be.

218
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,420
Aren't you guys training?

219
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,420
I'm going to Xicheng next month,

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,770
so my coach thinks...

221
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,220
Maybe he's still not giving up

222
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,980
on Shan Chong.

223
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,060
He's still not giving up?

224
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,100
Son.

225
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,220
Cut some cucumbers for me.

226
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,650
Actually, in the end,

227
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,300
it has nothing to do

228
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,850
with whether he's given up or not.

229
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,250
How should I put it?

230
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,420
It's hard to let go.

231
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,180
Hard to let go?

232
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,980
You seem to feel it

233
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,980
more than he does.

234
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,250
No, I don't. Don't disgust me.

235
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,490
I didn't.

236
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,530
You made me do it.

237
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,650
Coming.

238
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,250
Who is it?

239
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,700
Wang?

240
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,250
Mr. Shan.

241
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,180
Come in.

242
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,340
I brought you two bottles of good wine.

243
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,940
You just have to come

244
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,890
without bringing me anything.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,730
How long has it been?

246
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,730
We must have a drink today.

247
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,180
Look.

248
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,890
It's good.

249
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,980
You don't need to change your shoes.

250
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,580
I'll stain the floor.

251
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,580
The smell is too strong.

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,340
You know me well.

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,490
Where's Chong?

254
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,370
Helping us in the kitchen.

255
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:01,890
In the kitchen?

256
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,300
Go now.

257
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,130
Chong.

258
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,010
Chong.

259
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,340
Mr. Wang.

260
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,580
Leave me alone.

261
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,580
Chong.

262
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,770
We're frying fish. The fumes are too thick.

263
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,580
Here you go.

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,300
I'll fill your glass.

265
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,730
Now.

266
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,300
Try my specialty.

267
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,340
Thank you, ma'am.

268
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,420
It smells good.

269
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,530
Chicken with mushrooms.

270
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,490
Mr. Wang, have some more later.

271
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,250
Yes.

272
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,420
Chicken with mushrooms.

273
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,250
Son.

274
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,980
Drink with your coach.

275
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,940
Don't let your dad drink.

276
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,370
Come on.

277
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,730
Mom.

278
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,610
I can't drink much.

279
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,730
Let them drink together.

280
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,340
Okay.

281
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,250
Come on, let's drink.

282
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,130
Let's drink.

283
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,420
I came here to drink with you.

284
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,220
Okay. Come on.

285
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,730
Let's drink.

286
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,700
You're welcome.

287
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,100
How is it?

288
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,700
Is it strong?

289
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,890
It's good.

290
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,730
Come on.

291
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,770
Thanks, Mr. Shan.

292
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,580
Good.

293
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,730
Chong.

294
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,100
What have you been up to?

295
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,770
He seems to be busy with

296
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,250
teaching a rookie

297
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,700
sideslip lately.

298
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,100
Sideslip?

299
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,220
Even teaching this?

300
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:06,980
I mean,

301
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,820
I think it's good to teach sideslip.

302
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,340
It's safe.

303
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,010
After helping them get a good foundation,

304
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,370
he might be able to send a few talents

305
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,650
to your national team,

306
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,370
right?

307
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,580
Don't mention it.

308
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,650
Training and tournaments

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,700
at Xicheng start soon.

310
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,940
This idiot

311
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,610
can't finish anything.

312
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,770
I'm so anxious that I'm losing my hair

313
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,060
and my lips are swollen.

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,770
When Chong was there...

315
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,060
Right?

316
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,370
Chong.

317
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,060
Wang Xin.

318
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,340
Come on.

319
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,580
Thank you.

320
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,770
This dish I made

321
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,700
tastes so good.

322
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,610
Have some more.

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,250
Okay.

324
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,730
By the way,

325
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,610
is your kid going to take

326
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,490
the college entrance exam?

327
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,850
Next year.

328
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,100
Not that early.

329
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,610
And he doesn't ski,

330
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,890
so I can't teach him.

331
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,650
I can only let it be.

332
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,530
So Chong,

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,340
I...

334
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,130
I'll get a glass of water.

335
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,820
Come on.

336
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,700
Me, too.

337
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:00,700
Wang.

338
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,490
Come on.

339
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,420
Leave them alone.

340
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,010
Okay.

341
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,010
Let's go on.

342
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,370
Okay.

343
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,250
Drink more.

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,850
Okay.

345
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,420
Drink more.

346
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,220
Come on.

347
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,820
Come on, Wang Xin.

348
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,180
Shan Chong, what do you mean?

349
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,940
My coach was having a serious discussion with you,

350
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,130
but as soon as he talked, you left.

351
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,770
I'm talking to you.

352
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,220
Chong.

353
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,890
Come back.

354
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,010
Shan Chong is here.

355
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,580
All right?

356
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,370
You're drunk, aren't you?

357
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,650
We all need you.

358
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,060
Come back here.

359
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,890
Okay.

360
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,530
Everybody misses you,

361
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,340
you know?

362
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,180
Sir.

363
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,370
Come back now.

364
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:44,940
Okay?

365
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,820
Let's go home.

366
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,700
Sir.

367
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,300
Come on.

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,850
Are you all right?

369
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,180
Be careful.

370
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,530
Okay.

371
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,060
Chong.

372
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:49,850
Sir.

373
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,220
Take Master back safely.

374
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,100
Wrap him up in case he catches a cold.

375
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,420
You don't have to remind me.

376
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,940
Think about it.

377
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,770
Who is he doing this for?

378
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,420
Let's go.

379
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,770
Duo.

380
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,850
We have to stick together, Chong.

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,650
Sir, let me do it.

382
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,370
Come back.

383
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,010
Okay?

384
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,580
Take care of him.

385
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,980
Don't worry.

386
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,300
See you, sir.

387

OK.

388
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,580
Be safe.

389
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,180
Don't worry.

390
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,250
I'll come back to you in a while.

391
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,890
OK.

392
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,130
I'll go wash the dishes first.

393
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,580
Are you going to Xicheng, too?

394
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,700
When do you leave?

395
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,610
Tomorrow's flight.

396
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,890
Don't worry, Mom.

397
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,420

Dad, let me do it.

401
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,250
Let me do it.

402
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,490
Did you tell your mom

403
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,490
you're going to Xicheng?

404
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,250
Yes.

405
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,490
What did she say?

406
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,700
Nothing

407
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,010
except "be safe".

408
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,220
Do what your mom says,

409
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,220

410
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,010
Or I'll beat you up.

411

All right. Let me do it.

412
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,660
Let me do it, Dad.

413

414
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,620
Okay.

Don't help me. I'll be fine.

416

418
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,050
What did I drink so much for?

419
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,770
Didn't I do it

420
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,660
to ask Chong back?

421
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,490
Who sent you a message?

422
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,490
Tell him and ask him

423
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,770
to come back to the national team.

424
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,180
We need him back now.

426
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,570
Sir, are you okay?

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,050
Why don't you hold me up?

428
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,730
You didn't let me help you, did you?

429
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,530
Why do you obey me so much

430
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,290
when I don't need you?

431
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,490
If I order you to bring Chong back,

432
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,530
can you do it?

433
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,490

Pass it.

445
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,250
I'm sorry.

446

Let's go.

447
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,730
It's you.

448
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,570
Yes.

449
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,660
Why are you here?

450
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,050
I came to visit my brother.

451
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,330
If you come to visit your brother,

452
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,660
why are you waiting downstairs in the dormitory?

453
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,380
You could have met us

454
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,180
at the training ground.

455
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,140
Would you have waited here all day

456
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,220
if your brother had come back late?

457
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,900
I look like this,

458
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,420
so it's inconvenient for me to go over there.

459
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,140
The wheelchair is really quite inconvenient.

460
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,090
Get your sister fitted with prosthetic legs.

461
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,810
I've asked her.

462
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,180
Ask her for me.

463
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,730
Do you want prosthetic legs?

464
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,420
What does Uh mean?

465
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,420
Do you think wearing prosthetic legs

466
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,010
will make me look better?

467
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,420
Do you think your muscles won't atrophy

468
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,620

I need to interrupt you in your busy schedule.

471
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,380
There must be some bad reasons for your sudden respect.

472
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,330
Are you in trouble?

473
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,530

No need.

584
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,980
Thanks, Yiming.

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,220
This is too much.

587
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,810

It's weird.

Take these flowers.

590

Where is Jiang Nanfeng?

593
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,730
Jiang Nanfeng has a lot of work to do.

594
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,220
I'll do the small things

597
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,290
It's small for her,

598
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,660
but for me,

599
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,050
it's the most important thing.

600

Yes.

Aren't you also a Nancheng local?

614

Why did you ask me

615

to show you around?

616
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,660
Look. I've been abroad

617
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,660
for the past eight years.

618
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,420
From undergrad to PhD

619
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,700
and even my current job,

620
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,090
I've been busy as a bee.

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,770
How many times have I been back during that time?

622
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,380

623
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,010
so much.

Why did you peek at my cell phone?

I heard from Nanfeng earlier

640

that you were skiing together at Beishan.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,530
How does it feel?

642
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,380
Pretty good.

That's good.

You know what?

When I studied abroad,

647
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,140
I also liked to ski

648
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,620
and was really good at snowskiing.

649
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,490

in the Alps ski resort...

654
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,290
I snowboarded.

655
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,250
That's better.

656
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,420
I can teach you to snowski.

657
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,980
Snowskiing is better than snowboarding.

658
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,980
Who said that?

659
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,490
It's different, okay?

660
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,220
That's not true.

661
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,980
Snowskiing is much faster

662
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,730
than snowboarding.

663
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,490
Let me quiz you.

664
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,220
Do you know what the top speed

665
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,900
of snowskiing is?

666
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,140
The record speed for snowskiing

667
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,490
is 252 kilometers per hour

668
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,380
while snowboarding only reaches about 200.

669
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,180
Skiing is not about speed.

670
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,220
It's about skill.

671
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,050
You have no idea how cool snowboarding is.

672
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,290
My master...

673
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,420
No wonder you like snowboarding so much.

674
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,570
It's because it's cool.

675
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,660
Snowskiing is even cooler.

676
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,860
And at the later stage,

677
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,010
the skill requirement of snowskiing is higher

678
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,490
than that of snowboarding.

679
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,050
You must be tired

680
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,940
after a long flight.

681
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,050
Take a rest first.

682
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,180

690

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,050
Is that senior believable?

770
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,490
Is he serious?

771
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,820
He's the best at bragging.

772
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,490
Yes, he is.

773
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,570
Do you even believe him?

774
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,940
He's so unreliable.

775
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,010
I'm so nervous

776
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,300
about my interview this afternoon.

777
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,210
No. I'm so nervous.

778
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,050
I need to get a drink.

779
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,530
OK.

780
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,050
You guys go ahead.

781
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,820
All right. Just go ahead.

782
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,300
Wei Zhi, are you still painting?

783
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,740
I've been checking out a lot of companies lately.

784
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,610
Zhi, look.

785
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,420
Are my dark circles

786
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,260
especially obvious?

787
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,860
You seem to be a bit haggard,

788
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,090
but overall, it's okay.

789
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,940
You're still a lovely and quiet beauty.

790
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,130
You're so comforting.

791
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,530
The thought of going for an interview

792
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,740
made me so nervous,

793
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,300
so I stayed up all night.

794
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,050
In my next life,

795
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,530
I want to be a princess

796
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,490
like you.

797
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,170
I could have closed my eyes

798
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,340
and gone back to inherit the family business

799
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,650
instead of going to the interview.

800
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,690
But we found a couple

801
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,530
of pretty good companies.

802
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,530
Do you want to explore them with us?

803
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,570
No need.

804
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,690
I'd like to draw some more.

805
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,610
Okay.

806
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,530
You look really good

807
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,610
in a suit.

808
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,940
And when your bangs

809
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,900
are tied back, look,

810
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,570
they sparkle. So great.

811
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,490
Perfect.

812
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,900
Come on. Let me give you another suit.

813
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,490
Try another one.

814
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,050
This one's good.

815
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,740
Here you go. Try this one first.

816
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,570
Zhi, listen.

817
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,340
When you get to the office tomorrow,

818
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,300
familiarize yourself with the surroundings.

819
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,490
Then, come to my office.

820
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,490
I'll invite a few boys over for you

821
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,340
to check them out.

822
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,340
Why?

823
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,740
Don't you need a serious pick?

824
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,740
You know what?

825
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,900
These boys in the company

826
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,050
are pretty good.

827
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,260
I've asked around.

828
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,210
They're all

829
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,340
from Nancheng.

830
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,010
I'll be happy

831
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,210
when your marriage is finalized

832
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,570
and you get married

833
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,900
and even have children.

834
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,820
Mom.

835
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,650
I don't want to be an accountant.

836
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,900
What do you want to do then?

837
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,050
I have a career I like.

838
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,380
Leave me alone.

839
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,260
Where are you going?

840
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,300
Where are you going?

841
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,370
My friend's house.

842
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,300
I don't want to stay at home.

843
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,060
Where are your friends?

844
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,460
My local friend.

845
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,570
This is my path,

846
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,940
so I accept failure.

847
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,130
Who?

848
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,130
Why did you come?

849
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,900
I just got back from abroad

850
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,610
not long ago,

851
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,740
so I haven't had time

852
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,090
to come and see your new house.

853
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,900
That's why I am here.

854
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,130
Zhao Keyan.

855
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,050
Don't run out.

856
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,740
I'm just opening the door,

857
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,970
not going out.

858
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,900
Go change your shoes.

859
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,970
You're so big.

860
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,610
I think it's fine.

861
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,340
Do you live alone in this house?

862
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,780
With a dog. Nice.

863
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,300
It's safe.

864
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,530
Didn't I tell you?

865
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,300
I took Zhao Keyan

866
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,530
when I was in college.

867
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,300
The first time I met him,

868
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,490
I was super into him.

869
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,300
Zhao Keyan?

870
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,700
That's a weird name.

871
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,650
What do you want to drink?

872
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,780
Anything.

873
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,490
Thank you.

874
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,900
Nanfeng.

875
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,650
Did anything special happen

876
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,650
when you went skiing

877
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,450
with Zhi?

878
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,380
What special thing?

879
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,700
Did Zhi meet a master?

880
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,380
A man?

881
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,010
Yes.

882
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,700
Was he better looking

883
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,450
than me?

884
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,820
What's it got to do with you?

885
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,940
Is it comparable?

886
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,090
How can it have nothing to do with me?

887
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,380
Zhi's business is mine.

888
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,170
After all these years,

889
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,010
you're still so pestered

890
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,450
about Wei Zhi.

891
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,970
Why pestered?

892
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,570
I am affectionate,

893
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,860
fascinated,

894
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,220
and obsessive.

895
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,090
From the first moment I met Zhi,

896
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,740
she lived in my mind.

897
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,570
Yiming.

898
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,450
This is my friend.

899
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,780
I told you about her.

900
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,740
Her name is Wei Zhi.

901
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,300
Wei Zhi, hi.

902
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,300
Thank you for coming

903
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,530
to my birthday party.

904
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,530
Yiming.

905
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,570
Happy birthday to you.

906
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,450
Turn this clockwork,

907
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,740
and you'll see the surprise.

908
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,260
I'm so deeply in love

909
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,090
that I've spent more than ten years

910
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,260
of my youth loving someone.

911
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,860
How romantic.

912
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,170
Why do you say pestered?

913
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,860
Then have you ever heard

914
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,820
that love doesn't allow

915
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,610
wishful thinking?

916
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,530
Don't blow me off.

917
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,740
Let's go.

918
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,820
I'll buy you dinner tonight.

919
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,010
I'm not going.

920
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,010
I'm on a diet.

921
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,860
I don't want to eat.

922
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,260
I'll treat you to a fat-reducing meal.

923
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,780
Tell me

924
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,860
about Zhi's master.

925
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,450
Really. Tell me

926
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,610
about Zhi's master.

927
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,340
Tell me.

928
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll buy you dinner.

929
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,340
Zhao Keyan, help me.

930
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,340
Zhao Keyan.

931
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,650
Shan?

932
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,450
Can I come in?

933
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,300
Yes.

934
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,530
What are you reading?

935
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,740
Is it interesting?

936
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,220
Of course.

937
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,700
Are you sure you can read this before you open it?

938
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,300
Right to left.

939
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,900
Stupid.

940
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,300
How could I not know this?

941
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,300
I just want to see

942
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,450
how it ends first.

943
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,450
Okay. Go on.

944
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,340
I just came to care about you.

945
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,220
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to Xicheng.

946
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,300
As for you,

947
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,490
take care of yourself.

948
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,610
Be happy.

949
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,220
Anything else?

950
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,650
You should also work hard

951
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,940
at your job

952
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,940
and do what your Miss Zhai says.

953
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,700
Work hard.

954
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,050
My?

955
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,010
My Miss Zhai?

956
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,300
Chong.

957
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,380
We're family.

958
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,010
Your schemes are almost

959
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,650
in your face, okay?

960
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,300

So you're in love with someone.
