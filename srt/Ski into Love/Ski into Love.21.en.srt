Surprised?

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,180
Indeed.

32
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,620
I didn't expect you

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,690
to eat at a small restaurant like this.

Stupid puppy.

154
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,020
I thought

155
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,340
you were asking my name.

156
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,980
Do you mind?

157
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,290
If you do,

158
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,290
I'll change his name.

159
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't.

160
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,410
It has had that name for so long.

161
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,290
Right, Zhao Keyan?

162

164
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,340
Resign?

165
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,050
Why?

166
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,370
Because of me?

167
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,700
No.

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,220
It's because of me.

169
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,100
Are you uncomfortable with your senior

170
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,490
suddenly becoming your boss?

171
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,980
No.

172
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,340
Look.

173
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,850
When we were at Beishan,

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,370
you didn't know me,

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,610
so we were like two strangers

176
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,140
who met by chance.

177
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
You liked to play around

178
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,460
and treated it as a game,

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,980
while I

180
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,540
could show you

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,050
how much I liked you without any fear.

182
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,580
Anyway, back then,

183
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,660
nothing mattered

184
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,020
but having fun.

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,900
But now that

186
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,490
you remember me,

187
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,980
I can't pretend

188
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,410
we were strangers.

189
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,290
So I suddenly don't know

190
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,170
what to do.

191
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,290
It feels like

192
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,900
the moon in the sky

193
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,340
suddenly started following me.

194
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,490
The moon?

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,020
What moon?

196
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,160
This might

197
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,220
sound weird.

198
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,100
To me,

199
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,930
you've always been

200
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,780
the unattainable moon in the sky.

201
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,050
In fact, I've always

202
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,020
loved the night

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,140
because it's only when it's dark

204
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
that the moon appears,

205
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,810
and I'll have the chance

206
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,340
to talk to it about my thoughts

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,250
and express my love.

208
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,140
I could read poems to the moon,

209
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,980
sing songs to it,

210
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,850
or invite it to join me

211
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,490
for a drink,

212
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,730
but I didn't need it to respond

213
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,340
because I just liked it.

214
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,180
But now,

215
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,580
the moon has suddenly begun

216
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,730
to follow me.

217
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,770
I found this feeling

218
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,890
very strange

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,460
and uneasy.

220
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,130
Maybe

221
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,610
what I like

222
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,820
is the feeling I get when I admire you.

223
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,820
Admire what? What moon?

224
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,890
I didn't expect you to write poetry.

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,340
Zhao Keyan.

226
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,420
Zhao Keyan, come back.

227
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,940
It's not coming back.

228
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,580
Good.

229
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,720
You did a good 720°.

230
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,100
Let's end

231
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,990
our trampoline training

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
with this perfect maneuver today, shall we?

233
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,380
Don't worry, Sir.

234
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,010
I'm not tired yet.

235
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,370
Okay.

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,850
You did a good 720°.

237
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,340
Don't say I don't respect old people

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
and children.

239
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,820
Get lost.

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,650
You're in sync.

241
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,490
Take a break.

242
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,340
We'll train with the equipment later,

243
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,250
okay?

244
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,730
Gradually intensify the training.

245
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,130
Your technique is still there.

246
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,850
Don't be anxious.

247
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,650
OK. I'll take a break.

248
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,420
Chong, looking at your girlfriend?

249
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,940
You scared me.

250
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,900
Don't hide it.

251
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,780
Show it to single people

252
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,730
- like us. - Go away.

253
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,650
Shut up.

254
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,490
Go on with your training.

255
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,730
Are you that generous?

256
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,100
Are you up to no good?

257
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,650
What's wrong with you?

258
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,220
Who begged me to come back

259
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,940
back then?

260
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,650
It wasn't me.

261
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,940
Has Shan told you

262
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,610
anything lately?

263
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,340
Shan hasn't...

264
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,180
What do you want to know?

265
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,730
Forget that.

266
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,250
I get it.

267
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,730
Are you trying

268
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,980
to find out something

269
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,340
about your disciple through me?

270
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,940
What are you doing?

271
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,820
No wonder

272
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,840
I always feel

273
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,610
that you have a smell on you lately.

274
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,820
So

275
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,980
it's the rotten smell of love.

276
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,010
You're awesome.

277
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,180
So you...

278
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,220
What are you doing?

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,250
It's an act of violence.

280
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
I'll tell your sister.

281
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,850
Go ahead.

282
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,300
We'll see if she yells at me or you.

283
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,700
What's wrong with you?

284
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,580
You're upset with your girlfriend

285
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,460
but taking it out on me.

286
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,010
You're so unmanly.

287
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,820
I'm going to the toilet.

288
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,610
The door...

289
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,090
Look. I got

290
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,100
an e-mail.

291
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,250
Hello, dear author.

292
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,120
At this winter-spring,

293
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,370
we sincerely invite you

294
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,770
to participate in this interview

295
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,220
and enjoy the northern scenery

298
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,220
No.

299
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,370
The organizing committee of 300 Million People

300
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,250
on Ice and Snow sent this.

301
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,220
Look.

302
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,610
They said that they cooperated with the Culture and Tourism Forum

303
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,290
on a project called Drive Tourism with Culture

[Program details]
- Travel Together,

305
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,730
and organized

306
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,890
a group material collection

307
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,610
with a trip to the National Training Center.

308
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,060
But we are too busy,

309
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,610
how can we have time

310
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,940
to enjoy the northern scenery of the country?

313
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,650
What?

314
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,610
Do you want to go?

315
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,370
Since they mentioned snow sports,

316
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,460
I was wondering

317
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,490
if we should go for more materials.

318
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,180
Go for more?

319
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,300
We've done it

320
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,100
many times.

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,370
Don't waste your time.

322
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,820
We'll get more materials

323
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,370
if we go more often.

324
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,010
Haven't I given you enough materials?

325
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,060
What else do you want?

326
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,700
I'll find it for you.

327
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,250
Nothing.

328
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,130
Yeah. It's the same color

329
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,460
as this kid's ears.

330
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,300
Pink?

331
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,560
Yes,

332
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,580
but I think it could be lighter.

333
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,700
To give it a gradient.

334
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,490
Yeah. Add a little.

335
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:30,940
Like this.

336
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,620
Hello?

337
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,940
Are you the organizer

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,890
of Drive Tourism with Culture - Travel Together?

339
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,700
I received

340
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,610
your email,

341
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,250
so I wanted to ask.

342
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,420
When exactly

343
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,850
is the material collection event?

344
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,250
Can you really do it?

345
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,490
Why didn't you wait for me today?

346
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,900
I threw the game.

347
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,730
Didn't you see it?

348
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,290
Sir.

349
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,140
How long?

350
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,980
How's what?

351
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,290
Shan Chong's result is

352
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,620
10:23,

353
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,180
thirty-seven seconds over the mark

354
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,050
and one second over Dai Duo.

355
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,420
Sir.

356
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,330
I intentionally threw the game.

357
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,460
Can't you be humble?

358
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,330
Then let's race again.

359
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,490
I won't throw the game this time.

360
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,620
Don't count me in.

361
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,810
I'll reconcile work and rest.

362
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,050
Since you can run so well,

363
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,420
you should go to the track team.

364
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,290
You guys...

365
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,050
Sir.

366
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,280
You're a bit biased.

367
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,220
I'm biased?

368
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,010
If you practiced

369
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,250
as hard as Shan Chong usually does,

370
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,570
I'd be biased toward you too.

371
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,380
Let's go.

372
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,490
Your nose is running.

373
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,940
Don't I usually practice hard?

374
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,090
Trust your coach.

375
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,730
Let's go.

376
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,810
I must say

377
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,250
that your look just now

378
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,940
was somehow disgusting.

379
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,010
Get lost.

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,010
As you wish.

381
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,330
Do you think I don't have a girlfriend?

382
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,660
Why aren't you asleep?

383
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,010
I'd like to,

384
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,500
but someone's showing off

385
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,400
his love to me,

386
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,090
so I can't sleep.

387
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,700
Don't be ridiculous.

388
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,530
I didn't.

389
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,980
Let me show your sister.

390
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,620
Come on. Am I right?

391
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,380
What's wrong with him?

392
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,670
Why so shy?

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,080
What else

394
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,460
can he look at but Miss Zhai?

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,620
You know what?

396
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,010
Usually, your brother

397
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,900
is a man of few words,

398
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,570
but he has quite a few unknown thoughts.

399
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,730
What? Do you

400
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,570
need a spanking?

401
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,180
OK. Just go on.

402
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,900
Ignore me.

403
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,490
What did you do today, Shan?

404
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,860
Didn't I tell you?

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,240
We had a video conference

406
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,980
with Zhi

407
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,380
and Elephant today.

408
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,530
A video conference

409
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,490
with Miss Zhai and others?

410
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,180
What a shame.

411
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,290
Someone is too timid

412
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,860
to even make a video call,

413
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,730
so he has to look at those pictures

414
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,900
every day.

415
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,380
You know what?

416
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,010
The expression on your face

417
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,050
looks like you really deserve a beating.

418
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,620
Don't care about that.

419
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,260
Just tell me,

420
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,860
you love me.

421
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,460
Come on.

422
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,490
You're so dilly-dallying...

423
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,180
Why don't you go to bed in the middle of the night

424
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,100
and talk crap to him?

425
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,720
Listen to me.

426
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
You can be jealous that I have a girlfriend,

427
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,530
but why did you take my cell phone?

428
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,810
Why don't you shut up?

429
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,810
Why should I shut up?

430
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,620
You took my cell phone and told me to shut up?

431
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,220
Give me back my girlfriend.

432
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,570
Brat, wait and see.

433
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,730
What's the big deal about having a girlfriend?

434
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,860
What's the big deal about having a girlfriend?

435
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,250
Fighting is not allowed in the national team.

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,140
Are you the only one with a girlfriend?

437
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,810
Shan.

438
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,700
Don't fight.

439
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,570
Your brother is beating me.

440
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,050
Surrender.

441
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,290
No.

442
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,250
Okay, then. Go ahead.

443
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,700
Don't hit him in the face.

444
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,220
Shan.

445
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,420
Come on.

446
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,180
Everyone, welcome

447
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,620
to Xicheng.

448
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,010
Come on. Be careful.

449
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,090
Come on. This way.

450
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,770
This way.

451
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,220
This way.

452
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,940
Okay.

453
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,620
It's really something here.

454
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,500
Yes, it is.

455
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,090
Come on.

456
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,490
Miss Zhai,

457
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,860
is this your first time in Xicheng too?

458
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,770
I've been here a few times.

459
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,620
Really?

460
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,250
Then you must know

461
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,090
a lot of good food

462
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,770
and fun here, right?

463
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,050
I'll take you there later.

464
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,620
Okay.

465
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,660
Thank you.

466
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,050
Let's have a look.

467
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,900
Thank you.

468
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,490
Guys, thank you.

469
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,900
Thank you.

470
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,490
Come on.

471
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,460
Drive Tourism with Culture

472
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,010
- Travel Together's route

473
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,460
includes humanities,

474
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,290
sports,

475
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,940
nature, and food,

476
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,220
but we may have to

477
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,380
make a small adjustment

478
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,220
to the route.

479
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,380
On the last day,

480
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,860
we were supposed to go to the training center,

481
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,660
but due to negotiation problems,

482
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,570
we'll have to change it to tomorrow.

483
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,810
The room card is ready.

484
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,570
Is that okay?

485
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,450
No problem.

486
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,180
This is yours.

487
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Those who got the room card,

488
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,860
go wash up

489
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,620
and get cleaned up.

490
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,380
We'll meet here at 8:30.

491
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,890
In the evening, I'll take you

492
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,530
to some good food in Xicheng,

493
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,460
okay?

494
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,050
Okay.

495
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,860
Okay?

496
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,700
Okay.

497
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,460
Let's go.

498
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,420
[MissyJi]

499
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,540
[Grilled buns, naan bread, lamb kebabs... I'm coming!]

500
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,330
Wei Zhi in Xicheng?

501
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,010
She's collecting materials.

502
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,730
Is she alone?

503
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,140
There seem to be so many other artists.

504
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,770
That seems to be organized by the organizing committee.

505
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,730
Why don't you ask Zhi?

506
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,180
You haven't made up yet?

507
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,140
Kid, don't get involved in grown-ups' business.

508
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,700
If you don't take the chance now,

509
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,830
you'll miss the right person.

510
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,330
Noisy.

511
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,940
Go back to your drawing.

512
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,380
Come on.

513
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,090
Everyone.

514
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,330
We are now

515
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,180
at the training base

516
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,860
in the north.

517
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,330
Since our last competition

518
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,180
was about ice and snow sports

519
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,460
and got good feedback,

520
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,570
we're going

521
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,380
to include

522
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,460
a lot of snow sports

523
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,660
in this trip.

524
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,140
The national team is training in there right now.

525
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,220
We'll have a short interview

526
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,620
after they've finished training.

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,810
If any of you

528
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,670
need something from them,

529
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,600
feel free to come to me.

530
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,420
Meet me here in five minutes.

531
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,290
We'll go watch

532
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,940
the national team training together,

533
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,530
okay?

534
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,330
- Okay. - Okay.

535
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,490
Let's go.

536
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,530
Miss Qi.

537
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,810
Let me ask.

538
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,420
Which program are we going to see first?

539
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,860
Snowboarding.

540
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,380
What to do? I'm so nervous.

541
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,570
I don't seem to be ready.

542
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,290
Dear, calm down.

543
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,860
Are you a fan

544
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,940
meeting your idol for the first time?

545
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,900
To be honest,

546
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,250
I don't seem

547
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,460
to know how to face him.

548
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,940
What will I say

549
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,010
if I meet him?

550
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,250
Don't think so much.

551
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,700
You're just going to collect materials.

552
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,050
That makes sense,

553
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,490
but...

554
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,250
There is no "but".

555
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,290
If I see him, I'll walk up

556
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,860
and say, “Hi,

557
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,530
long time no see.”

558
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,380
That's right.

559
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,730
That's more like you.

560
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,700
Come on.

561
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,220
This is our

562
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,250
physical training gym.

563
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,530
This is our

564
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,250
strength training area.

565
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,180
And over there.

566
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,050
That's our

567
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,050
core training area.

568
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,330
And then, over there,

569
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,050
that's our agility area.

570
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,290
All right.

571
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,980
Just wander around.

572
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,380
If you have any questions, come to me.

573
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,330
I'll be right here,

574
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,050
okay?

575
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,490
- Okay. - Okay.

576
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,460
Come on.

577
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:47,980
Everybody.

578
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,770
