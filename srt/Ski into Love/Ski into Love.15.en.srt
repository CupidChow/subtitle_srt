I told you I've got some family stuff going on.

See you later, bye.

See you later.

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,740
I haven't played enough.

Can you handle it?

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,460
Want me to get it for you?

No, I'm fine.

I have called her

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,290
to send these over.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,570
Why did you come in person?

65
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,380
It's okay. I just happened to be on my way.

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,820

Let me ask you.

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,850
What exactly

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,130
did Zhi do in Xicheng?

71
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,610
Why are you

72
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,170
and Yiming both back

73
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,980
while she's still out playing alone?

74
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,570
Ma'am.

75
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,290
We were supposed

76
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,130
to come back together.

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,570
Then why didn't you

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,780
come back together?

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,060
Zhi is a comic artist,

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,380
so she probably had to do

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,890
some comic-related work.

82
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,100
What kind of work?

83
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,220
Spend a little time picking up material.

84
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,340
What kind of material

85
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,060
requires her to hang out by herself?

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,060
Exactly.

87
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,610
How can she do that?

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,850
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I have to go.

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,610
I have a meeting.

90
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,410
An evening meeting?

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,540
You know what? I'm very busy at the office.

92
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm really busy.

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,540
I'll miss you, ma'am.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,380

95
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,340

96
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,260
Don't keep lying for her.

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,980
That's great.

101
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,730
When Zhi was here last time,

102
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,780
I really liked her

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,450
to the extreme.

104
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,170
That's right.

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,380
Chong.

106
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,660
You made a good choice.

107
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,170
Zhi.

108
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,810
So did you.

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,410
Dad.

110
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,540
Stop flattering.

111
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,410
Dad.

112
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,100

- Let's eat. - Okay. Come on.

Come on.

116

Come on.

117
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,540
Take your seats.

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,050
Come on.

119
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,660
Let's eat.

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,140
Come on.

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,730
Shan, come on.

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,460
Spicy.

123
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,220
Spicy.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,580
Thank you, ma'am.

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,250
You're welcome.

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,290
Come on, son.

127
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,900
Have some white wine.

128
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,900
Thanks, Dad.

129
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,660
Dad, Mom.

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,140
I've come back this time

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,700
to discuss something

132
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,410
with you.

133
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,580
We want to fit Shan with prosthetic legs.

134
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,540
The doctor

135
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,050
is Wei Zhi's

136
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,290
childhood friend.

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,660
He studied in Germany,

138
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,290
very experienced,

139
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,980
and could match Shan

140
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,780
with the best prosthetic legs.

141
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,780
Sir, ma'am. Don't worry.

142
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,900
He's a professional.

143
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,850
Leave it to him.

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,410
Okay.

145
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,340
Zhi.

146
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,410
Come on.

147
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,340
I'll make a toast to you.

148
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,050
Sir, I should make a toast to you.

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,660
No.

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,610
I have to

151
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,660
make a toast to you.

152
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,290
Thank you

153
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,610
and your friends

154
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,290
for helping Shan so much

155
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,050
and solving a big problem

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,020
in our family.

157
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,700
It's true.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,930
It's the right thing to do.

159
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,170
Please don't say that.

160
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,850
It's...

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,610
It's Shan Chong who's been saving up.

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,050
Zhi.

163
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,540
Let me toast you first.

164
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,900
As for your friend, I'll definitely toast him

165
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,780
when we get to Nancheng.

166
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,540
Thank you.

167
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,020
I want to thank you, too.

168
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,730
Come on.

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,050
Come on.

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,930
Okay.

171
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,100
Come on. Sit down. Zhi.

172
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,410
Actually,

173
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,370
everyone's been working so hard

174
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,700
because of my legs.

175
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,050
I'd like to propose a toast, too.

176
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,370
Okay.

177
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,020
Come on.

178
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,050
Wish Shan success.

179
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,700
Thank you.

180
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,100
Cheers.

181
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,900
Cheers.

182
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,780
Come on.

183
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,050
Now eat. Take them out.

184
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,220
The meat's almost overcooked.

185
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,220
Come on, then.

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay.

187
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,610
Zhi.

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,460
Eat more vegetables.

189
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,780
Wei Zhi loves meat.

190
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,730
Really?

191
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,170
Then eat more meat.

192
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,900
Yes.

193
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,170
Come on.

194
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,020
Full of meat.

195
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,540
Come on. Dad.

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,540
Pass me

197
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,250
the cilantro.

198
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:42,730
All right.

199
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,700
Come on, sweetie.

200
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,980
The cilantro.

201
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,460
[Comics Online Voting]

202
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,290
What's going on?

203
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,290
Don't worry.

204
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,700
It's just the first episode.

205
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,730
I have faith in our comic.

206
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,220
We've even been ranked ninth before.

207
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,220
Let's wait and see,

208
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,220
right, Elephant?

209
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,850
Right.

210
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,810
Don't be anxious.

211
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,900
I think

212
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,460
Zhi's account is too new,

213
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,290
and we're creating

214
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,370
an indie comic,

215
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,780
so the platform won't recommend us.

216
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,930
We'll definitely not have a good result

217
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,780
at the beginning.

218
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,900
But

219
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,140
isn't this a competition?

220
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,170
The platform

221
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,490
will attract traffic to other works.

222
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,660
So if that's the case,

223
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,100
what's fair about it?

224
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,980
Nowadays, how can there

225
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,140
be any absolutely fair contest?

226
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,370
As long as the participating artists

227
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,610
have the support of a company behind them,

228
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,410
the platform will make more recommendations.

229
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,340
It's all obvious and unspoken.

230
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,490
I think

231
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,490
the platforms' recommendations

232
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,810
may be useful in the initial stages,

233
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,540
but if we want support in the later stages,

234
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,340
we have to rely

235
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,700
on the content of the comic.

236
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,100
Let's work a little harder

237
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,780
to try and attract some traffic.

238
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,020
I'm an eagle woman,

239
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,460
so I won't give up.

240
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,660
Elephant, come on.

241
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,370
- Come on. - Come on.

242
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,900
Come on.

243
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,730
Have some tea first.

244
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,900
Shan.

245
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,020
Look.

246
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,540
He's still on the platform.

247
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,220
Does he want to go back?

248
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,170
When was this?

249
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,810
A couple of days ago.

250
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,730
I found it

251
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,490
when Shan was watching the video.

252
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,220
Did Zhi reach Nancheng?

253
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,050
Yes.

254
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,730
She just sent me a message.

255
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,980
That's good.

256
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,700
If he really wants to go back,

257
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,530
will you still object?

258
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,250
What do you mean?

259
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,530
What do you mean by "I object"?

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,700
Weren't you worried

261
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,980
or sad

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,980
when your son got hurt?

263
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,300
Okay, calm down.

264
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,770
Aren't I discussing this with you?

265
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,300
What will you think

266
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,130
if he really asks us

267
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,250
about returning to the team?

268
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,770
Actually,

269
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,580
I always knew

270
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,250
he wanted to go back,

271
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,820
but I just think...

272
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,420
I just think...

273
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,180
these two kids are so pathetic.

274
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,460
Why are you crying again?

275
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,010
Oh...

276
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,730
Stop crying.

277
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,820
Okay.

278
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,610
Stop it.

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,610
Stop it.

280
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,130
OK.

281
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,100
Look at you.

282
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,130
OK.

283
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,940
I got it.

284
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,530
OK.

285
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,220
OK.

286
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,130
As you wish.

287
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,100
Stop it.

288
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,820
Don't let them see you like this

289
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,010
when they come back.

290
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,180
OK.

291
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,420
Don't worry about it.

292
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,490
I'll listen to you.

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,340
Hello? We're here.

294
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,610
Where are you?

295
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,530
We're here.

296
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,820
I'll be at the door in a minute.

297
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,250
I didn't see you.

298
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,700
I'll be right there.

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,340
In a second.

300
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,220
Hi. I'm sorry.

301
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,850
I'm sorry.

302
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,340
It's okay.

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,300
I was just checking out the house with another client.

304
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,890
Come on. This is it.

305
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,530
This one.

306
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,770
Come on in.

307
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,250
It looks good.

308
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,300
It's cozy.

309
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,340
I'll take a look.

310
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,130
Kitchen.

311
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,980
It's missing a few amenities.

312
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,180
Sir.

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,820
This bed is a little too small,

314
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,700
so can we

315
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,580
have a bigger one?

316
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,940
Look. It's so high.

317
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm sorry.

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,980
It's the biggest one we have.

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,850
There's always a way, right?

320
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,610
It's livable.

321
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,610
This apartment

322
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,940
is exactly what you asked for.

323
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,700
There is a hospital across the street,

324
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,980
and the rent is cheap.

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,100
You can even pay monthly.

326
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,700
That's right.

327
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,530
Okay, so be it.

328
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,580
Do you have the contract?

329
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,100
Yes, I do.

330
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,100
Do you have your ID?

331
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,250
In a minute,

332
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,250
give me a copy of your ID.

333
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,580
Your brother agreed

334
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,610
so quickly.

335
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,890
I haven't even bargained yet.

336
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,100
He's such an honest man.

337
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,980
Zhi.

338
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,820
Thank you.

339
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,300
This house is really nice.

340
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,180
Really?

341
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,130
I think it's a little smaller

342
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,300
than it looks in the photos.

343
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,370
Smaller is not a problem.

344
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,130
Didn't you hear that? Cheap.

345
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,820
You asked

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,770
why my parents didn't come

347
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,820
last time at the airport.

348
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,010
My brother was there, so I couldn't talk about it.

349
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,850
Because my mom felt that if they came,

350
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,420
they'd need to take a leave with a pay deduction

351
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,220
and rent a bigger house.

352
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,610
That would have cost even more money,

353
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,490
so they totally left me

354
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,940
to my brother.

355
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,180
I see.

356
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,490
Do you really like it?

357
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,370
Of course.

358
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,220
I really like

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,940
that yard out front.

360
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,650
That's it then.

361
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,980
Hello?

362
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,460
Okay. I'll be right there.

363
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,420
OK.

364
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,220
Come on.

365
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,940
Keys.

366
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,730
Well, enjoy your stay.

367
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,420
Thank you.

368
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,220
Thank you.

369
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:23,940
Thank you.

370
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,730
Which room do you want?

371
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,300
Any of them.

372
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,820
All right, then.

373
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,700
This one is yours.

374
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,820
Let me help you with your luggage.

375
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,490
Thanks, Zhi.

376
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,010
This way.

377
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,180
Maybe that's enough.

378
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,580
If there's more, we won't finish it.

379
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,250
How can this be enough?

380
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,460
I can help.

381
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,420
I see.

382
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,300
So that's what you really want to say.

383
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,130
I love helping people.

384
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,300
Let's take a look at the pot.

385
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,180
Don't waste your money.

386
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,060
I've got some at home.

387
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,940
I can give you mine.

388
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,610
You're not eating?

389
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,980
I...

390
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,340
I can order takeout.

391
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,420
It's not good for your health to eat takeout all the time.

392
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,820
You can come to my place to eat.

393
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,610
Really?

394
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,940
I can go every day?

395
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,980
You could even

396
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,530
live there.

397
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,460
That...

398
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,180
That might not be good.

399
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,730
It's too soon.

400
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,460
What are you thinking?

401
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm just kidding. Let's go.

402
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,100
We're back.

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,490
Zhi.

404
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,250
Chong.

405
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,420
I'm video chatting with my mom.

406
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,650
Hello, ma'am.

407
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,100
Mom.

408
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,890
Hi.

409
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,300
We're going to cook.

410
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,730
Go ahead.

411
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,420
Mom, you know what?

412
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,420
Chong says he's going to cook his specialty,

413
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,940
but he doesn't usually cook at home,

414
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,730
so I don't believe

415
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,940
he can cook anything.

416
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,340
Don't talk about your brother like that.

417
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,530
Your brother's gone through a lot

418
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,460
outside.

419
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,250
Maybe

420
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,100
he's good at cooking.

421
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,130
Let me do it later.

422
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,220
I can do it. Trust me.

423
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,940
Done.

424
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,340
Next, yam.

425
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,130
Don't touch the yam

426
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,100
with your hands.

427
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,650
Wash your hands.

428
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,850
Don't touch the yam

429
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,940
with your hands.

430
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,130
It'll tickle.

431
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,650
You're such a considerate man.

432
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,300
Your dish.

433
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,130
It's getting burned.

434
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,530
First,

435
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,980
we brown the meat.

436
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,850
What's next?

437
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,820
Next...

438
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,100
Smell that?

439
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,490
The aroma is already coming out.

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,460
Let's put a little

441
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,180
salt next.

442
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,980
Cheers.

443
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,370
- Cheers. - Cheers.

444
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,130
Shan, try it.

445
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,610
I made this.

446
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,010
This is your brother's.

447
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,010
See which one is better.

448
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,730
I'll definitely try this one.

449
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,980
Some of them may be undercooked.

450
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,820
How is it?

451
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,850
It's delicious.

452
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,730
Isn't it?

453
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,610
Zhi, you're so good.

454
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,220
Why are you even

455
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,460
so good at cooking?

456
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,180
Don't flatter me. I'm naturally virtuous.

457
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,850
It's really delicious. Let me taste it again.

458
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,700
Then eat more.

459
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,060
Here, her brother.

460
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,460
Here you go.

461
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,220
Don't be sad.

462
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,340
It's good.

463
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,580
By the way,

464
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,370
we're going to the hospital

465
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,530
tomorrow morning.

466
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,340
I've already made an appointment.

467
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,980
We can go straight to Dr. Jiang

468
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,250
tomorrow morning.

469
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,980
Then I must

470
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,980
have a good meal

471
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,730
before going to the hospital.

472
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,890
This is for you.

473
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,220
Thanks, Zhi.

474
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,820
You're welcome.

475
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,650
Since someone

476
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,420
praises his own cooking

477
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,820
so much,

478
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,940
you try it first.

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,610
Let me eat some vegetables first.

480
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,850
What?

481
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,940
Do you think that's not good?

482
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,460
How was it?

483
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,730
How was it?

484
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,490
Delicious.

485
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,340
Really?

486
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,130
Try it.

487
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,820
I'm good.

488
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,010
You let me taste it while you don't?

489
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,980
Give it to your sister.

490
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,460
Come on.

491
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,300
Taste it.

492
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,980
Chong.

493
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,220
You're my brother.

494
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,770
The soy sauce flavor is very strong.

495
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,810
Please be kind.

496
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,980
Zhi, look.

497
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,570
The one I got

498
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,730
is not colored yet,

499
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,460
but I added

500
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,250
one of my ideas to it.

501
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,860
It has

502
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,380
a treasure bag inside,

503
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,140
from which many things

504
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,180
can be pulled out.

505
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,620
This would make it look cute.

506
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,460
The idea

507
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,010
is really quite creative,

508
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,810
but look at this storyboard.

509
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,140
Shouldn't this

510
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,730
be here?

511
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,380
Yes.

512
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,290
Where are you going?

513
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,380
To take out the trash.

514
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,980
What's wrong

515
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,770
with him?

516
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,330
Is taking out the trash so much fun for him?

517
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,490
I don't know.

518
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,570
Let's go on

519
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,290
and check more.

520
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,900
All right, then.

521
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,180
Next...

522
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,900
It's just...

523
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,460
Why are you out?

524
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,140
Aren't you guys talking about work?

525
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,050
Zhi's been busy all day.

526
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,700
She kept yawning just now.

527
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,140
Now she's asleep.

528
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,460
It's almost Chinese New Year.

529
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,380
Do you think

530
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,810
we'll celebrate Chinese New Year here?

531
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,770
If things go well,

532
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,220
we won't.

533
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,860
If it doesn't go well

534
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,420
and we need to be here for the New Year,

535
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,940
we'll buy a couplet

536
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,090
and put it on that door,

537
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,010
okay?

538
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,090
Well.

539
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,420
Don't worry about me.

540
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,290
I'm just saying.

541
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,860
It'll be fine.

542

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,810

We're here.

Why are you here?

for something as important

568
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,290

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,530
Let me introduce you. This is Shan Shan.

581
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,250
Hello, I'm Shan Shan.

582
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,860
Hi.

583
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,090
Leave it to me from now on.

584
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,290
This time,

585
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,570
we really need your help.

586
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,900
Don't say that.

587
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,810
We had a deal.

588
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,530
We're family.

589
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,530
Anyway,

590
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,330
thanks, bro.

591
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,460
You guys, two men,

592
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,250
stop it.

593
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,660
Pay attention to today's heroine,

594
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,180
okay?

595
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,380
I forgot to introduce myself.

596
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,620
My name is Jiang Yiming.

597
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,730
You can just call me Yiming

598
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,940
like Zhi.

599
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,570
You're the head doctor?

600
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,660
Then my legs...

601
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,010
Please.

602
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,180
Don't mention it.

603
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,490
If nothing else happens,

604
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,010
I'll be your doctor

605
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,250
from now on.

606
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,250
And by “anything else happened”,

607
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,420
I mean something

608
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,620
like Shan Shan doesn't think I'm handsome enough

609
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,980
and wants a better-looking doctor.

610
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,010
Not funny? Then I'll stop.

611
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,860
Let's go. To my office.

612
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,420
Let's go.

613
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,330
Let's go.

614
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,660
Come with me. This way.

615
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,460
You don't need to register.

616
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,250
I've already filed a case for Shan Shan.

617
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,140
Let's go

618
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,050
to my office now.

619
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,140
I'll explain

620
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,010
the process to you.

621
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,770
Shan Shan.

622
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,810
If you have any questions,

623
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,730
you can just ask me.

624
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,570
Not at the moment.

625
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,660
Don't you want to know

626
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,810
why we're family?

627
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,810
Why?

628
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,140
As long as your brother doesn't break up with Zhi,

629
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,980
we are family.

630
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,460
Zhi.

631
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,940
Is that something he can say?

632
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,620
You're the head doctor now,

633
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,770
so anything you say is right.

634
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,860
It doesn't matter.

635
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,770
Even if your brother breaks up with Zhi,

636
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,940
we're still family.

637
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,730
Just think of me as your brother.

638
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,140
Jiang Yiming, even if you don't talk,

639
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,980
no one will treat you as a dumb guy.

640
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,220
It's still a dry joke.

641
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,940
Not funny?

642
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,660
I promise there won't be a third one.

643
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,730
This way.

644
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,810
Come on.

645
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,810
Be careful.

646
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,420
How long have you had this condition?

647
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,660
How did it happen?

648
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,900
She was injured

649
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,490
while skiing years ago and was hospitalized.

650
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,490
Then it got worse,

651
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,570
and the doctors decided to amputate.

652
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,980
How is your sensation in this area?

653
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,730
It

654
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,290
only hurts occasionally.

655
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,860
And this leg?

656
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,530
Does it hurt?

657
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,460
This leg

658
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,490
also hurts occasionally.

659
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,380
This cross section

660
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,140
is quite smooth,

661
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,380
and there are no depressions

662
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,380
or partial adhesions

663
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,090
of the skin here.

664
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,900
Your skin sensation is also normal.

665
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,460
Come on.

666
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,620
Do a muscle strength test.

667
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,050
Fight my strength.

668
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,140
Lift up.

669
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,140
This way.

670
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,660
Use your maximum strength.

671
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,980
Your muscle strength is quite good,

672
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,730
as is the elasticity of your skin.

673
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,180
And look.

674
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,050
Your legs are very symmetrical,

675
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,940
and

676
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,380
there's no

677
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,770
muscle atrophy.

678
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,900
Do you usually

679
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,090
do some rehabilitation?

680
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,140
Yes, I do.

681
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,660
Look. Right?

682
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,810
So

683
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,380
this part down here

684
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,620
is a cylinder.

685
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,380
Also,

686
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,530
overall,

687
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,140
the state of your skin

688
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,730
and other aspects

689
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,980
are actually

690
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,420
quite suitable for prostheses.

691
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,010
Really?

692
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,570
Yes.

693
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,330
I'm suitable for that.

694
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,330
But

695
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,290
we're going to have to

696
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,290
run a few more tests

697
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,380
to be sure

698
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,380
and make

699
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,420
a further evaluation.

700
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,050
First of all,

701
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,180
I think you have to have a blood test

702
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,010
and a biochemistry test

703
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,010
to see

704
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,700
if there's any internal inflammation

705
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,420
or

706
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,090
some neurological damage, etc.

707
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,810
Then,

708
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,050
you will need

709
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,730
to have an MRI

710
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,900
and ultrasound

711
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,810
to see if the internal bones

712
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,010
and muscles

713
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,330
are in good condition

714
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,490
for prostheses at this time.

715
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,980
I will

716
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,250
make an appointment for that.

717
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,770
Thank you.

718
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,290
You're welcome.

719
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,700
Thank you.

720
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,770
She's doing really well.

721
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,490
Congratulations.

722
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,490
I made an appointment.

723
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,770
And then,

724
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,090
since the MRI is going to be done

725
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,940
three days from now on,

726
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,940
I've scheduled all the others together

727
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,980
for three days later.

728
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,570
You guys just need

729
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,380
to come here once.

730
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,220
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

731
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,220
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

732
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,180
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

733
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,380
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

734
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,180
You're welcome.

735
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,050
Shan Shan.

736
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,860
Is this your first time

737
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,810
in Nancheng?

738
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,530
Yes.

739
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,050
Then you can

740
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,380
go sightseeing

741
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,900
and visit the beach these days.

742
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,980
I can go to the beach?

743
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,530
Don't worry.

744
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,980
I've already made plans.

745
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,700
Okay.

746
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,730
Let me see you off.

747
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,140
No need, Dr. Jiang.

748
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,660
Well.

749
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,620
I'll do my job then.

750
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,570
See you the day after tomorrow.

751
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,860
Thanks, Yiming.

752
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,900
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

753
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,660
- Thank you. - Bye.

754
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,620
Bye.

755
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,180
Let's go.

756
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,620
Master.

757
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,180
Look at that.

758
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,810
It's a beautiful view.

759
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,090
But the weather's not so good.

760
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,940
Master.

761
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,330
Is there a sea in Hualing?

762
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,250
In Hualing, the most beautiful thing

763
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,090
is the snow in winter.

764
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,140
So next time,

765
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,490
let's go to the beach together,

766
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,380
watch the sunset,

767
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,220
and shout at the sea.

768
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,380
Okay.

769
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,660
A little further.

770
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,490
How is it? Is it pretty?

771
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,140
I take better pictures.

772
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,220
Take a picture for me.

773
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,810
Wei Zhi.

774
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,810
Wang Laohu

775
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,220
seems to be selling the movie and TV adaptation rights

776
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,330
of Half a Farewell Song.

777
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,220
Hasn't that been sold already?

778
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,980
But that fizzled out

779
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,860
because of AI drawing.

780
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,810
However, he was so good

781
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,330
that he found another buyer right away.

782
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,090
Okay.

783
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,010
Let's not talk about it.

784
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,050
What do you want to eat?

785
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,860
I'll recommend

786
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,980
the local food here.

787
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,140
Everything is delicious.

788
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,730
Then you guys order.

789
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,250
You're more familiar with it.

790
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,940
Okay, I'll order.

791
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,460
Which one is good?

792
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,570
Enjoy your meal.

793
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,140
Thank you.

794
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,090
Thank you.

795
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,180
We're going back to Hualing

796
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,290
after your brother takes us for a checkup.

797
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,140
So soon?

798
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,330
Why don't you stay a few more days?

799
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,420
Ask Wei Zhi to take you

800
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,180
and Shan Shan on another tour.

801
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,860
I'm ready to go back to the national team.

802
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,860
I've been vacant

803
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,730
for too long in formal training.

804
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,860
I'll go to see you when I'm free.

805
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,460
Work hard.

806
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,490
Don't trouble yourself.

807
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,220
That's right.

808
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,570
How can he concentrate on training

809
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,620
if you go to see him?

810
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,620
Eat something good

811
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,810
to replenish your business acumen.

812
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,010
I have much business acumen.

813
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,160
[Coloring-Meizi]

814
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,770
Zhi.

815
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,660
I'm going to pay you back for advancing my fee.

816
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,460
Thanks for your help.

817
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,620
Meizi.

818
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,980
It's been a while.

819
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,420
How have you been?

820
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,620
You don't have to pay me back.

821
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,250
That's your drawing fee.

822
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,290
You deserve it.

823
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,900
Also,

824
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,620
I've started drawing comics again.

825
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,220
If you're interested,

826
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,730
would you like to join us?

827
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,570
Elephant is also there.

828
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,290
And a new friend.

829
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,250
You're all that's missing.

830
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,700
Zhi, I'm sorry.

831
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,730
I appreciate your kindness,

832
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,810
but I have to

833
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,940
focus all my energy

834
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,700
on Xuan's education right now,

835
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,490
so I really can't spare the time.

836
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,860
Meizi.

837
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,180
What happened to Xuan?

838
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,220
Is there anything I can do to help?

839
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,620
Hello, Elephant.

840
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,180
Have you been in touch

841
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,940
with Meizi lately?

842
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,490
No, I haven't.

843
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,220
We haven't had much contact

844
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,180
since what happened to Farewell Song.

845
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,180
What? You couldn't find her?

846
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,730
I just tried to invite her back,

847
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,860
but she turned me down

848
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,220
and said she wanted to devote all her energy

849
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,810
to taking care of Xuan.

850
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,810
I'll think about it again.

851
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,490
Okay.

852
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,050
Bye.

853
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,730
Okay?

854
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,660
[Wei Zhi]
Your dad'll come back for your birthday.

855
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,010
Let's celebrate it together.

856
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,330
I'll be back soon.

857
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,940
Let me take a call,

858
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,140
okay?

859
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,940
Say bye-bye to me.

860
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,490
Bye-bye.

861
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,570
Hello?

862
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,700
Hello?

863
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,420
Mr. Zhang.

864
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,460
Are you busy?

865
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,250
I'm the same as always.

866
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,530
Mr. Zhang.

867
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,290
Are you not at liberty to talk?

868
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,620
You can finish your work first.

869
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,530
No.

870
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,940
My current work

871
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,860
is almost over.

872
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,010
I'm going home

873
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,050
for my son's birthday.

874
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,220
Zhi.

875
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,050
How have you been?

876
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,420
I heard

877
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,290
you entered

878
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,330
that Comic Award.

879
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,010
Right.

880
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,570
So did Manman.

881
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,620
Zhi.

882
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,420
You know I'm still working

883
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,900
in Wang Laohu's company,

884
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,660
so there may be some things

885
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,730
I can't do.

886
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,290
Mr. Zhang, don't get me wrong.

887
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,380
I didn't call you

888
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
to talk about comics.

889
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,090
I want to ask you.

890
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,700
Have you

891
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,940
contacted Meizi recently?

892
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,810
She doesn't seem

893
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,330
to be in good shape.

894
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,620
Meizi?

895
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,290
It's because of her child.

896
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,420
You know

897
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,570
her life

898
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,420
is full of difficulties

899
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,220
and setbacks,

900
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,420
but Xuan is always

901
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,490
getting her into trouble.

902
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,980
In fact, I'm responsible for that, too,

903
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,250
because I didn't do her any favors.

904
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,090
I see.

905
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,860
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

906
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,490
Go to work.

907
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,380
Zhi.

908
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,980
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

909
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,900
You're welcome.

910
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,490
Mr. Zhang.

911
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,460
Happy birthday to your son.

912
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,250
Okay.

913
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,290
Bye.

914
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,810
What's wrong?

915
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,180
What happened?

916
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,770
Nothing.

917
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,530
Tomorrow,

918
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,980
I'm going to a friend of mine.

919
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,380
Are you going to settle the score

920
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,420
with Wang Laohu?

921
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,050
Don't be impulsive.

922
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,530
We have to think twice before we act.

923
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,700
Of course not.

924
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,090
I'm going to Meizi.

925
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,420
She resigned from the company.

926
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,140
It seems something happened to her family.

927
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,010
Meizi is...

928
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,940
She's my former assistant

929
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,140
I told you about.

930
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,330
Okay.

931
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,330
Let me go with you.

932
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,900
I'll be worried if you go alone.

933
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,940
Meizi got divorced a few years ago.

934
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,490
She has a son named Xuan

935
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,730
who lived with her after their divorce.

936
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,770
You know what?

937
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,380
Her ex-husband was so bad,

938
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,140
super awful.

939
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,180
After the divorce,

940
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,490
he never visited his kid

941
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,380
and didn't even pay child support.

942
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,980
At that time,

943
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,140
our team had just been formed.

944
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,730
It was difficult for everyone,

945
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,010
but Meizi was the one

946
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,700
with the most difficulties.

947
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,770
Hello.

948
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,460
Are you Miss Zhai?

949
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,220
I was introduced by Mr. Zhang Yu.

950
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,940
Please come in.

951
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,770
I painted these before I got married.

952
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,770
It's true I haven't painted over the years,

953
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,490
but I still have all my skills.

954
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,810
If I practice more,

955
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,050
I'll be able to take over this job soon.

956
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,460
You didn't draw comics before?

957
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,180
Then do you know how to do computer graphics?

958
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,420
I can learn.

959
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,700
I'm a fast learner.

960
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,700
I'll accept a trial period

961
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,770
of one month.

962
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,460
Meizi.

963
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,380
I'll lend you a drawing tablet.

964
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,290
When you go back,

965
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,620
try to do

966
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,730
some basic work

967
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,180
like simple coloring.

968
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,700
After a while,

969
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,980
bring in your work.

970
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,660
I'll

971
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,660
grade it

972
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,420
with our studio partners,

973
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,620
okay?

974
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,530
OK.

975
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,940
I'll work on it.

976
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,810
At that time,

977
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,330
Meizi worked at a supermarket during the day

978
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,330
and had to cook for her kid after work.

979
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,420
After that, she was free

980
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,660
to come to me for drawing lessons.

981
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,330
Meizi was really diligent

982
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,330
and hardworking.

983
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,940
She came to me every day and stayed up late practicing,

984
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,050
so she was getting better very fast.

985
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,820
She had a day job,

986
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,300
but not once

987
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,050
was her drawing delayed.

988
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,860
She finished on time every time.

989
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,690
Later, Elephant and Manman joined us.

990
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,690
Half a Farewell Song was launched,

991
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,130
and its statistics went through the roof.

992
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,340
During that time, we all thought

993
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,490
the future was looking up,

994
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,130
and Meizi gradually

995
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,860
made drawing comics a full-time job.

996
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,740
You know what happened after that.

997
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,650
Our studio

998
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,820
was disbanded

999
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,780
because of AI drawing.

1000
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,740
We didn't even have an official goodbye

1001
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,460
before the studio was disbanded.

1002
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,010
Since you know

1003
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,010
who did this,

1004
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,170
why don't you turn her in?

1005
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,300
Do you think

1006
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,610
Meizi did it?

1007
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,300
It wasn't her.

1008
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,980
All I can say is

1009
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,820
that everyone has difficulties.

1010
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,210
Meizi did,

1011
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,380
and so did the guy

1012
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,940
who's supposed to be responsible

1013
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,490
for this.

1014
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,090
So

1015
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,690
you're not afraid

1016
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,650
you'll lose your career?

1017
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,130
That's something I thought about,

1018
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,940
but then, I chose to take it on

1019
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,170
because I thought

1020
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,340
I had a way back,

1021
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,050
but for them,

1022
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,460
it would have been harder

1023
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,090
on their lives and families

1024
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,050
if they lost their jobs.

1025
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,210
Nevertheless,

1026
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,050
Meizi resigned.

1027
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,300
I heard from a coworker yesterday

1028
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,740
that Xuan was addicted to online games,

1029
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,490
so

1030
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,010
Meizi wanted to work from home

1031
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,610
to keep an eye on him.

1032
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,460
But Wang Laohu

1033
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,340
was just too evil.

1034
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,740
He never agreed.

1035
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,380
How

1036
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,010
can there

1037
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,650
be such an insensitive boss?

1038
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,340
Geez.

1039
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,740
Okay. Don't be mad.

1040
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,610
Let's go and check first.

1041
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,740
There.

1042
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,210
When we get up there,

1043
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,530
I'll tell Meizi

1044
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm visiting her

1045
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,090
with my boyfriend.

1046
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,490
Okay.

1047
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,050
Then I'll be a good tool.

1048
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,300
It should be here.

1049
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,820
Meizi.

1050
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,090
Meizi, it's Wei Zhi.

1051
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,780
Meizi.

1052
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,780
Zhi?

1053
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,860
Why are you here?

1054
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,780
Hello, Meizi.

1055
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,820
Hello.

1056
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,420
Let's go in.

1057
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,940
Please come in.

1058
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,820
Zhi.

1059
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,090
You came to me after you heard

1060
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,740
what happened to me, right?

1061
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,610
You guessed it.

1062
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,940
Sorry, Meizi,

1063
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,820
I took the liberty

1064
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,690
of asking Mr. Zhang Yu

1065
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,650
for your address.

1066
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,050
It's okay.

1067
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,130
Don't say that.

1068
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm really grateful to you.

1069
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,340
You've always helped me

1070
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,900
in my most difficult time.

1071
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,210
And now, you've come to visit me.

1072
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,940
It's the right thing to do.

1073
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,940
By the way, Meizi.

1074
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,490
Why haven't we seen Xuan?

1075
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,210
He's in his room.

1076
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,010
I'll get him out

1077
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,980
to say hello.

1078
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,610
Xuan.

1079
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,340
Xuan.

1080
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,300
I'm going in.

1081
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,490
Look who's here.

1082
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,380
Xuan.

1083
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,530
Meizi.

1084
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,570
Let him rest.

1085
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm really sorry.

1086
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,940
Zhi.

1087
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,650
What do you think I should do?

1088
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,570
He's not so young anymore,

1089
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,010
so I can't criticize him

1090
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,050
or beat him.

1091
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,820
I had no choice,

1092
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,170
so I applied for him to be suspended from school.

1093
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,380
Meizi.

1094
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,530
You've done your best,

1095
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,690
but it's not a good idea

1096
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,460
to keep the boy

1097
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,420
at home every day.

1098
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,650
So how about this?

1099
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,940
Tomorrow, let me take Xuan

1100
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,780
out for a walk.

1101
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,260
I'll find a way to have a chat with him.

1102
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,210
Right.

1103
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,460
They're both boys,

1104
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,900
so they'll definitely have more in common.

1105
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,740
Okay.

1106
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,300
Dad, Mom.

1107
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,050
I had an impromptu surgery,

1108
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,780
so I'm late.

1109
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,260
Why so romantic today?

1110
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,130
Candlelight dinner.

1111
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,460
Is it your anniversary?

1112
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,690
Because our dad

1113
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,090
got a big deal

1114
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,460
and wanted to come out to celebrate.

1115
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,530
Our dad's always been this good.

1116
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,170
Come on.

1117
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,050
Congratulations.

1118
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,610
Let's drink.

1119
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,380
Congratulations.

1120
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,090
All right.

1121
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,130
Come on.

1122
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,170
Aren't I great?

1123
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,170
So are you, mom.

1124
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,690
Dad, what did you

1125
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,530
get my mom

1126
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,460
when the big deal came through?

1127
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,530
A big diamond ring?

1128
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,050
I only bought a bag.

1129
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,610
I'll let you off this time.

1130
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,820
You're so happy, Ms. Lin.

1131
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,610
Don't envy me.

1132
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,820
If you can find a good husband,

1133
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,010
you don't have to worry that no one loves you,

1134
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,650
but the key is whether you want one or not.

1135
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,780
Again?

1136
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,740
What's so funny?

1137
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,780
I have my brother in front of me

1138
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,340
anyway.

1139
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,340
You should rush him first.

1140
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,210
You're right.

1141
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,690
Don't just focus

1142
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,570
on your work

1143
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,900
and forget about your marriage.

1144
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,860
Yes, I know.

1145
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,650
Yeah. Look at you.

1146
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,940
You're too busy working all day

1147
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,860
to spend time with Zhi.

1148
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,010
At this rate,

1149
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,610
when will I see

1150
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,740
my daughter-in-law?

1151
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,380
Don't just eat.

1152
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,340
Look at you.

1153
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,340

00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,460
so let's start with the most handsome one first.

1167

OK.

Are you there?

No need to reply to me.

1175
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,650
There are times

It's been so long since I've been out shopping,

1212
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,210
so I don't even know where to start.

You don't have to spend money.

I have to work and take care of the kids,

1217

so I don't have that much time.

1218
