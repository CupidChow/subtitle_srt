Where's K?

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,060
Where is he?

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,100
Come out.

49
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,730
The one on the bike. Come down.

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,850
What?

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,450
Why are you yelling for?

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,540
Didn't Chong teach you

53
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,570
manners?

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,130
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

55
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,610
Don't be a coach

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,730
when you have nothing to show for it.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,220
I beg your pardon?

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,100
I'm talking about you.

59
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,100
You're bad at snowboarding.

60
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,100
It's fine if you charge 1,200 yuan for your fees.

61
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,660
But you had the audacity to ask Zhi

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,010
to snowboard on the advanced slope.

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,290
Do you know she got injured because of that?

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,500
We're not leaving

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,060
until you give us a satisfactory

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,690
explanation.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,780
I don't owe you anything.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,450
If your boss was good at teaching,

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,340
she wouldn't have had to come to me.

70
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,260
What did you just say?

71
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,780
Say that again.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,340
What is this?

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,850
Do you want your license revoked or what?

74
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,130
K.

75
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,660
I thought Wantong Academy was full

76
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,660
of bad snowboarders.

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,890
It turns out it's bad snowboarders with bad characters.

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,100
Excuse you?

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,380
If she wasn't your student,

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,730
I wouldn't even entertain her.

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,890
I tested her

82
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,290
and discovered her abysmal skill.

83
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,500
Now who's the bad coach here?

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,410
Let's meet at the park tomorrow

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,010
to find out who's the worst.

86
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,010
That'll shut your mouth.

87
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,660
Whoever doesn't come is the coward.

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,890
Stop it already.

89
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,980
No need to be scared.

90
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,020
I don't think

91
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,140
you're bleeding.

92
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,490
It's just an abrasion.

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,100
You can still snowboard.

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,250
I'm leaving the morning after tomorrow.

95
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,730
I won't have enough time to snowboard.

96
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,490
Please, miss.

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,610
But you have to take them off.

98
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,370
Let me see.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,850
No.

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,780
Just let me go.

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,220
Miss,

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,580
what is going on?

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,980
She said her feet were hurting.

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,140
I wonder if she hurt her feet

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,410
but she refuses to take off her shoes.

106
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,170
I can't assess the wound like this.

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,700
Let me do it.

108
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,340
Okay.

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,610
Suffering now is better than later.

110
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,370
Be gentle.

111
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,290
I can do it.

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,220
I can do it.

113
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,930
Come. Let me dress the wound.

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,930
No need.

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,170
No need.

116
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,780
Don't.

117
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,610
Don't.

118
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,050
Don't look at it.

119
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,100
Didn't I tell you

120
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,930
to use a Band-Aid?

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,250
You didn't even know you left your phone.

122
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,930
Why are you such an airhead?

123
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,490
My phone...

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,290
Where's my phone?

125
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,370
My phone?

126
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,410
Jiang Nanfeng took it back for you.

127
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,490
For an airhead,

128
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,540
you actually remembered

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,460
to bring your tortoise cushion.

130
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,340
Newbie gear equipment

131
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,460
is mandatory.

132
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,660
So you know you're a newbie.

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,370
I told you not to go on the advanced slope.

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,020
I told you to use a band-aid on your heels.

135
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,140
Did you do any of that?

136
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,490
None.

137
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:47,780
What?

138
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,610
None.

139
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,100
Louder.

140
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,100
None.

141
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,020
Shame on you.

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,580
Master,

143
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,370
stop nagging me.

144
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,140
I am already wounded,

145
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,730
and you keep scolding me.

146
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,340
Done.

147
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,610
You can throw a tantrum at your boyfriend,

148
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,660
but you must listen to me.

149
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,930
Take care of your wound.

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,700
Don't get it wet.

151
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,490
If you still feel unwell,

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,220
go to a hospital.

153
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,980
No.

154
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,580
He's not my boyfriend.

155
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,930
A boyfriend is not

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,810
that mean.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,700
Rest now.

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,340
If nothing comes up later,

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,900
you may go.

160
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,900
Thank you so much.

161
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,050
Sorry.

165
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,220
don't say that.

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,810
I disobeyed your instructions

167
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,850
and went to the advanced slope.

168

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,810
Put me down then.

195
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,370
Wei Zhi, are you okay?

196
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm fine.

197
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,460
We went to the doctor already.

198
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,650
Her feet are injured.

199
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,530
Make sure not to wet the wound.

200
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,940
Can you give me

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,650
a break?

202
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,530
I took my eyes off you for a second.

203
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,300
Then, you dropped your phone

204
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,850
and hurt yourself.

205
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,490
What were you thinking?

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,650
Stop scolding me.

207
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,980
I already got an earful.

208
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm with Shan Chong this time.

209
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,250
I think he did the right thing.

210
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,650
But...

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,890
I'll carry her upstairs.

212
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,250
Wait.

213
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,250
Put me down.

214
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,300
We're at the elevator already.

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,770
It's embarrassing if everyone sees me in this state.

216
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,580
I can walk.

217
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,180
Put me down.

218
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,980
I'll help her.

219
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,940
Come.

220
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,730
Careful.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,130
You're an idiot.

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,180

Fight?

226
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,730
You're on the national team.

227
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,460
You can't get into a fight.

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,730
I was on the national team.

229
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,130
I...

230
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,300
Rest well.

231
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,340
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

232
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,460
Master...

233
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,890
Don't worry.

234
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,130
There's no fight.

235
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,010
See you.

236
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,850

237
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:42,730
Come.

239
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,420

241
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,100
What if it leaves

242
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,770
a scar?

243
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,490
It's my heel, not my face.

244
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,010
If it leaves a scar, so be it.

245
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,850
Thankfully, it's not on your face.

246
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,340
If your mom sees it,

247
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,370
she'll assemble a team of lawyers

248
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,610
to sue me till I'm bankrupt.

249
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,890
She won't do that.

250
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,250
I can count

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,820
with my fingers the times I see her in a year.

252
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,300
She won't notice it.

253
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,820

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,730

255
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,010
Yeah?

256

Listen.

258

didn't get into a fight with anyone?

Shan Chong is level-headed.

260
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,580
You need to mind your business.

261
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,700

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,060

but my brother is coming back.

266
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,100
You need to be mentally prepared.

267

275
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,010
But your master,

Yan,

277
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,220

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,820
they all belong here.

279
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,130
Your life doesn't belong here.

280
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,940
We don't belong here.

281
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,940
I know.

282
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,650
Do you know, Jiang Nanfeng?

283
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,340
When I fell today,

284
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,850
I had a hallucination.

285
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,340
I saw my parents

286
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,490
snowboarding here, too.

287
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,420

appeared,

289
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,820
it suddenly clicked in my mind.

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,610
It

291
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,180
felt

292
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,580
weird.

293
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,940
I'm nonetheless happy to secure

294
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,340
the bronze medal this time.

295
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,490
I'm aiming for the gold medal next.

296
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,460

298
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,180
Yes, of course.

299
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,650
I will train hard

300

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,980
Who do you think you are?

387
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,820
Chong.

388
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,340
Dai Duo is here again.

389
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,220
Dai Duo?

390
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,770
Dai Duo.

391
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,180
He's a show-off.

392
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,300
He's so cool.

393
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,980
He's showing off.

394
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,340
Must he do that?

395
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,610
Dai Duo.

396
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,340
Why are you still here?

397
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,100
I heard

398
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,010
you guys

399
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,180
are competing against Wantong Academy.

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,220
It has nothing to do with you.

401
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,300
If you lose

402
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,460
to people like them,

403
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,650
you're truly bad.

404
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,700
What?

405
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,180
He...

406
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,580
Pay him no mind.

407
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,770
Thanks, Master.

408
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,730
Check out my snowboard.

409
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,890
Zhi,

410
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,940
how are your feet?

411
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,770
Much better.

412
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,060
Wantong Academy is here.

413
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,000
[Dangerous Stunts. Do not attempt]

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,860
That's a lot of them.

415
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,770
They are good.

416
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,570
They look amazing.

417
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,460
How do we do the match?

418
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,570
Anything.

419
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,180
We'll perform the same tricks.

420
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,530
You do your tricks,

421
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,570
and we will follow.

422
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,660
Five versus five, deal?

423
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,620
Bring it on.

424
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,180
Okay.

425
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,250
However,

426
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,660
you can't go first.

427
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,700
What a waste of time.

428
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,010
Who do you want to go first?

429
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,570
Pick one.

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,700
They are trying to select the weakest snowboarder first,

431
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,050
as they fear your master,

432
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,980
the best snowboarder among here.

433
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,980
They are cowards,

434
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,140
although it's a valid strategy.

435
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,380
All the best!

436
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,050
You can do it.

437
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,860
All the best!

438
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,530
I'll go first.

439
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,090
One leg?

440
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,810
You can do it.

441
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,620
All the best!

442
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,250
One leg?

443
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,940
Go.

[Dangerous Stunts. Do not attempt]

Beici!

446
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,330
Not bad, Beici.

447
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,010
Master,

448
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,770
I'll go second.

449
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,730
Chong,

450
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,180
let me do it.

451
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,730
Yan!

452
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,660
Yan!

453
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,660
Yan!

454
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,730
Nice one.

455
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,090
Another trick!

456
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,570
My turn.

457
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,940
Not bad, Yan.

458
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,530
Not bad.

459
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,490
You have improved.

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,220
That's what K can do?

461
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,660
He couldn't even get on the rail.

462
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,290
Huayan.

463
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,900
Huayan! Huayan!

464
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,050
Hua!

465
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,940
Huayan!

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,570
Yes!

That is so cool.

469
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,420
Hua, you're so amazing.

470
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,290
Your master's turn now.

471
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,010
We're winning.

472
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,290
Are we still doing this?

473
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,460
Don't worry.

474
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,530
Against you,

475
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,770
I don't even have to play.

476
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,050
Now stop being a prick on the field.

477
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,730
Let's go.

478
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,380
Bye.

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,940
Indeed, they are no match

to you.

482
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,730
But I am.

483
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,090
Why?

484
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,940
You're scared?

485
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,220
Afraid to lose to me?

486
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,770
Why do you look so worried?

487
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,050
Your master was a professional snowboarder.

488
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,090
Don't worry about him.

489
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,730
But he is retired.

490
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,330
So what?

491
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,980
He was a professional,

492
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,940
and you're just a rookie.

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Don't worry about him.

494
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,460
Do you know

495
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,730
why he retired?

496
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,700
I'll ask Yan for you

497
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,620
next time.

498
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,460
Yes or no?

499
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,380
It's just an answer.

500
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,180
Let's go.

501
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,530
Where's Yan?

502
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,090
Up there.

503
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,860
He'll come down soon.

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,290
Okay.

505
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,940
That's a slope?

506
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,730
It looks more like a cliff.

507
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,220
Don't jinx it.

508
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,660
But it sure looks

509
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,730
scary.

510
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,570
If this is already the tallest platform

511
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,290
in the park,

512
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,290
can you imagine the big air?

Chong.

514
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,570
Can you tell me for sure

515
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,460
if you can do it?

516
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,090
I'm not doubting you.

517
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,140
I'm sure you can do it.

518
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,460
I'm sure you have practiced it

519
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,420
in secret.

520
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,460
In secret?

521
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,860
In the open, of course.

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,530
In the open.

523
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,050
I mean,

524
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,010
with your back...

525
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,140
Be careful.

526
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,010
Don't worry.

527
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,730
I know what I'm doing.

528
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,250
Yan.

529
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,050
Hurry up.

530
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,810
It's starting soon.

531
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,140
I will treat this

532
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,180
as a real tournament.

533
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,250
I won't go easy on you.

534
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,770
It's Dai Duo. Take a look.

535
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,900
This is...

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,090
Backside 1080.

537
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,330
He did

538
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,660
a 1080 on this terrain?

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,810
Dai Duo is good.

540
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,220
1080?

541
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,660
Is this Dai Duo?

542
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,940
He is so good.

543
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,530
He has improved so much.

545
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,050
Chong!

546
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,940
Don't touch him.

547
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,460
Do you think Master

548
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,490
is under a lot of pressure now?

549
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,380
I have faith in him.

550
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,860
All the best, Master!

551
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,090
All the best.

552
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,250
You're the best.

553
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,770
You're so loud.

554
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,490
Here he goes.

555
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,420
Master!

556
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,380
Chong!

557
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,860
Switch stance frontside 1260!

558
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,530
He did it!

559
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,810
Are you okay?

560
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,090
Are you okay?

561
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,490
My master

562
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,700
is so good.

563
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,140
He is.

564
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,010
New snow goggles?

565
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,250
They look nice.

566
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,090
What is wrong with you?

567
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,140
Why do you want my goggles?

568
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,570
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

569
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,330
Bye.

570

571
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,460
Why are you not joining me

572

in a tournament?

573
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,730
Pro,

574
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,010
can we shake hands?

575
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,900
Just call me master.

576
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,700
How are your feet?

577
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,180
Much better.

578
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,730
Master,

579
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,770
let's take a photo together.

580
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,940

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,980
Jing!

582
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,180
Let me catch up with my friend.

583
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,810
Give me a moment.

584
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,250
Jing,

585
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,700
what brought you here to Beishan?

586
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,530
I completed a tournament several days ago

587
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,810
so I was given a break.

588
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,090
How

589
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,900
is the coach doing?

590
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,220
He's well.

591
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,570
I saw him a few days ago,

592
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,090
and he was ranting to me

593
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,900
that

594
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,490
none of those kids

595
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,090
was

596
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,250
as good as you.

597
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,380
It's all in the past.

598
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,010
Are you sure?

599
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,980
Look into yourself.

600
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,250
I saw your performance in a tournament before.

601
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,980
Even though you've retired for a long time,

602
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,010
your skill is not rusty

603
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,770
at all.

604
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,730
You've been practicing in secret.

605
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,900
I...

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,620
Why don't you go back?

607
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm a grown-up now.

608
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,050
I learned to compromise.

609
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,900
I can't do whatever I want to do.

610
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,570
You're right.

611
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,010
Some things

612
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,220
are out of our control.

613
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,220
But some things

614
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,250
are still

615
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,770
under our control.

616
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,250
For example,

617
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,860
your passion,

618
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,730
and

619
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,980
your life direction.

620
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,700
In your journey,

621
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,090
many things will be there

622
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,380
to stop you, to impede you.

623
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,140
But you still

624
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,220
have the final say.

625
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,530
Do you know how many times

626
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,770
I fell

627
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,980
while doing tricks?

628
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,730
107 times.

629
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,770
When I joined the national team,

630
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,050
I still thought

631
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,140
that I was the gifted one.

632
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,250
After I joined them, I realized I was

633
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,220
the worst among them.

634
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,620
I hated it.

635
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,620
It's true.

636
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,570
I told myself that if I didn't achieve something

637
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,900
while on the national team,

638
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,250
I would fail myself.

639
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,420
Later,

640
00:27:59,550 --> 00:27:59,980
I realized

641
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,010
that life didn't fail me.

642
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,530
Ice skating didn't fail me.

643
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,730
When I was wearing

644
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,050
the national flag,

645
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,220
all my sweat and tears

646
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,010
were worth it.

647
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,700
I used to

648
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,490
dream about that a lot.

649
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,250
But now...

650
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,250
When it comes to your passion,

651
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,090
even if you don't say it out loud,

652
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,250
it will show

653
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,900
in your eyes.

654
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,380
You're an

655
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,380
exceptionally gifted

656
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,010
snowboarder.

657
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,140
For you,

658
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,490
a gold medal is not a dream.

659
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,140
There's a real possibility to get it.

660
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,730
Besides,

661
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,090
you love

662
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,940
snowboarding.

663
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,980
And if you can make our nation proud with it,

664
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,940
don't you think that's very cool?

665
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,460
Master,

666
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,900
who is that guy?

667
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,290
World Champion of Short-Track Speed Skating,

668
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,940
Wu Dajing.

669
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,290
Wu Dajing?

670
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,050
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

671
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,460
I would have taken a photo with him.

672
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,940
When

673
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,380
are you leaving tomorrow?

674
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,860
Tomorrow morning.

675
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,620
Let's have dinner together tonight.

676
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,010
With everyone.

677
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,180
Sure.

678
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,900
Guys,

679
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,010
Nanfeng and I are leaving tomorrow.

680
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,730
Let me buy all of you dinner tonight

681
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,810
to thank you

682
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,860
for looking after us.

683
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,810
You're leaving as well?

684
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,730
Yes.

685
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,380
Why didn't you tell me?

686
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,980
Must I?

687
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,490
What are we eating?

688
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,220
Oh, I almost forgot.

689
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,810
We have a movie to watch tonight.

690
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,940
Right.

691
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,700
We have a movie to watch.

692
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,010
Enjoy the dinner.

693
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,730

Wei Zhi.

696
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,330
I also forgot

697
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,770
that I'm watching the movie with them.

698
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,490
What? What movie?

699
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,770
- Just go. - Grab your snowboard.

700
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,900
How come I wasn't aware of it?

701
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,980
Grab your snowboard.

702
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,090
I want food.

703
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,180
I don't want to watch a movie.

704
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,900
Enjoy the dinner.

705
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,050
Let's go.

706
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,620
Coming!

707
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,420
Let's go.

708
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,730
How much longer

709
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,420
do I have to walk like this?

710
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,250
Master,

711
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,530
why are you putting on the snowboard?

712
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,700
Are you

713
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,050
sliding down?

714
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,810
What about me?

715
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,250
You can't possibly be this heartless.

716
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,860
My feet are hurt.

717
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,860
Don't leave me.

718
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,700
Come.

00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,460
to say something nice

773
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,530
out of common courtesy?

774
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,900
You're leaving tomorrow,

775
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,530
but you still don't know how to switch your edge.

776
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,940
Is it an occasion to celebrate?

777
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,810
Fine.

778
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,900
Once I'm back,

779
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,290
I'll find an indoor snowboarding center

780
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,090
to train myself.

781
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,140
I will impress you

782
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,490
when we next meet.

783
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,250
When will that be?

784
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,290
Next year.

785
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,140
Will you be here

786
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,620
next winter?

787
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,860
I'm not sure.

788
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,940
After this,

789
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,570
I will head to Xicheng.

790
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,220
How nice.

791
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,660
I have always wanted to visit Xicheng.

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,700
You can come with us.

793
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,050
You know,

794
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,780
destiny can be quite uncanny.

795
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,980
A video

796
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,650
by Mr. Glasses Cloth gave me the idea

797
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,610
to come here

798
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,940
to seek inspiration.

799
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,340
Who would have thought that you

800
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,130
are Mr. Glasses Cloth himself?

801
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,380
You talk a lot.

802
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,130
No.

803
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,380
I'm just happy

804
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,780
to follow my instinct

805
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,210
and to have met you here.

806
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,460
Well, I mean

807
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm happy to be here

808
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,980
and to have met you,

809
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,170
Yan, Beici, and Huayan.

810
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,260
I'm happy to have met you, too.

811
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,130
As a failed product of my teaching, you reminded me

812
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,380
that I

813
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,690
have to improve my coaching skills.

814
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,170
A snowboard will reveal

815
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,980
whether one has talent or not.

816
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,690
It's not entirely my fault either.

817
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,940
Yes, it's mine.

818
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,300
I'll find you a better coach

819
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,260
next time.

820
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,010
No need.

821
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,740
I prefer to get back on my feet

822
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,170
where I fall down.

823
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,210
Master,

824
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,260
do you know

825
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,740
I'm referring to you?

826
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,650
Come.

827
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,050
All the best

828
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,780
to you and your comic.

829
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,010
Thank you.

830
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,260
I hope you

831
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,340
can continue pursuing your dream.

832
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,340
You looked so cool when you jumped off

833
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,340
that platform today.

834
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,780
Eat more.

835
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,740
I'm not a foodie.

836
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,490
Rest early tonight.

837
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,340
And safe travel tomorrow.

838
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,130
Thank you.

839
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,610
Rest well tonight, too.

840
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,900
So,

841
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,940
when are you visiting Xicheng?

842
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,460
I'm not sure.

843
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,420
I need to go back to my hometown first

844
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,010
and stay there for a while.

845
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,980
You're there to see your parents?

846
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,780
And my younger sister.

847
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,940
You have a younger sister?

848
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,340
She's around your age.

849
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,090
That's nice.

850
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,090
Master,

851
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,210
thank you

852
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,050
for looking after me.

853
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,900
I should get going.

854
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,740
Bye.

855
00:36:59,230 --> 00:36:59,690
Bye.

856
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,010

Did you not get enough of my brother's

859
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,460
harsh scolding?

860
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,300
What? No.

861
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,570
I can do that trick, too.

862
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,050
I went easy on him today.

863
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,940
You're childish.

864
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,340
I had a match with him today.

865
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,130
I thought I could win,

866
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,650
but I was wrong.

867
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,570
Why did you

868
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,130
ask for a match all of a sudden?

869
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,420
Is he all right?

870
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,610
I'm sure you know already

871
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,740
that he's in good form.

872
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,860
He must have been training.

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,420
Shan.

874
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,460

875
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,340
on his dream,

876
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,900
has he?

877
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,010
Maybe.

878
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,650
If it wasn't because of me...

879
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,090
Stop.

880
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,740
Stop?

881
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,460
You should stop.

882
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,170
If you do this again,

883
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,780
I...

884
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,460
What will you do?

885
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,010
We will break up for five minutes.

886

887
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,260
will break up with me for five minutes?

888
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,860
Can we do three minutes?

889
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,170
Five minutes is so long.

Oh, Wang.

896
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,530
Wang is calling me.

897
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,570
I need to pick up this call.

898
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,170
I'll call you back later.

899
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,090
Okay.

Miss Zhai,

905
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,380
I've thought it through.

906
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,780
I want to be your assistant,

907
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,860
can I?

908
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,860
Sure. You're more than welcome.

909
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,420
However,

910
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,610
I must tell you something.

911
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,490
In fact,

912
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,260

913

914
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,170
So that's the current situation.

915
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,650
In the future,

916
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,050
it might be more difficult.

917
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,130

918
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,490

this was my student gift?

the match you had with Dai Duo was so cool.

00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,900
can you tell us what a park is?

992
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,010
The park we refer to

993
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,130
is actually called

994
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,090
snowboarding slopestyle.

995
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,610
It is composed of various obstacles,

996
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,980
such as platforms, fixtures,

997
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,130
and surfaces.

Athletes

the most suitable slope

for their tricks.

1002
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,860
The whole slope is equipped

1003
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,050
with numerous rails, boxes,

1004
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,380

1031
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,860

Other than passion and dreams, snowboarding

1034
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,340
is also about freedom.

1035
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,420
But do you know

1036
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,010
how to tell who's the better athlete?

1037
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,340
I don't need to know that.
