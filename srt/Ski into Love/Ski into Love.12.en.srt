00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,610
Ready?

191
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,020
Three, two, one!

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,220
One more.

193
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,050
Three, two, one!

194
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,340
- What about you? - I'll join for one.

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,370
Yeah, let's take a selfie.

196
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,170
Come on.

197
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,410
Three, two, one!

198
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,170
Three, two, one!

199
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,930
Okay, got it.

200
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,420
Let's go check out the snow over there!

201
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,780
Jiang Yiming, let me see the photos.

202
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,610
- Take it slow. - This is amazing.

203
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,100
What kind of angle is that?

204
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,050
Is this what you guys call powder snow?

205
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,250
Yep.

206
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,980
Are you cold?

207
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,140
- I've got gloves on. - Master!

208
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,610
Wei Zhi!

209
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,050
Let's go!

210
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,880
- Throw it at her! - Hurry.

211
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,390
I can't. The snow is way too hard.

212
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,540
In the south,

213
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,540
we never get to see

214
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,900
snow like this!

215
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,170
I'm hitting that slope!

216
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,020
And that one!

217
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,460
Let's go.

218
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,980
Go for it!

219
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,730
One, two.

220
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,980
Be careful.

221
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,850
I'm having so much fun.

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,370
It's so beautiful!

223
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,900
How about we do

224
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,780
Domino Falls?

225
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,810
- I'm in! - Sounds great!

226
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,860
- Sure. - Let's do it!

227
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,730
I'll record it.

228
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,730
We'll all fall backward.

229
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,220
I'll capture the moment for you.

230
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,410
Alright, one at a time.

231
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,460
Beici, you go first.

232
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,540
Alright!

233
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,010
- Go, Beici. - Be careful.

234
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,940
Are you ready?

235
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,410
All set.

236
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,460
You're doing it too, Jiang Yiming.

237
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,810
Alright.

238
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,850
- Count us down. - I'm going first.

239
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,110
Make it cool, Beici.

240
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,820
- Get ready. - Give us a countdown.

241
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,610
Alright, listen to me.

242
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,370
Three,

243
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,140
two,

244
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,930
one!

245
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,050
Jump!

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,780
I think I just gave myself a concussion.

247
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,060
This is like a snow bed.

248
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,530
Hurry up, Beici!

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,100
This room has such

250
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,580
a cool vibe!

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,250
This one's beautiful, too.

252
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,460
Master,

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,220
which room are you taking?

254
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,370
Whichever's fine.

255
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,370
Then who are you rooming with?

256
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,180
How about me?

257
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,890
Let's settle this

258
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,250
with "Black and White."

259
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,340
Sure.

260
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,820
Let's do it.

261
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,770
Okay.

262
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,850
Alright,

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,850
you guys sort it out.

264
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,060
I'm claiming this room!

265
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,100
How could you two

266
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,130
take a room while I'm still

267
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,850
unloading the luggage?

268
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,610
Where am I supposed to stay?

269
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,610
Maybe you shouldn't have

270
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,340
taken so many photos outside

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,850
without me.

272
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,940
I did wait for you.

273
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,370
I'll check upstairs, then.

274
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,890
I'm coming with you.

275
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,100
Me, too.

276
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,460
This room's nice.

277
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,220
It's spacious.

278
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,890
That one looks even bigger.

279
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,530
Really?

280
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,130
- Not bad. - Nice.

281
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,610
It's huge!

282
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,700
Look at these hats.

283
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,700
Nice.

284
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,820
I like it.

285
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,580
I regret my choice.

286
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,460
I want to stay up here, too.

287
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,650
Too late.

288
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,060
The whole second floor is mine.

289
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,010
That looks great on you.

290
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,850
Take a picture for me.

291
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,530
Okay.

292
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,220
Come on.

293
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,220
With this on, I'm 190 cm.

294
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,940
You look adorable.

295
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,460
I'll take

296
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,340
a picture for you.

297
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,420
I'll send it to you.

298
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,300
It's so cute.

299
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,700
My turn!

300
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,370
Alright, alright.

301
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,270
You two have fun.

302
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm going to unpack.

303
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,100
- We'll head down after this. - Okay.

304
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,490
Okay.

305
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,530
- Hurry. - Okay, got it.

306
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,730
Black

307
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,470
and white!

308
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,180
Again.

309
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,820
Black

310
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,490
and white!

311
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,180
Let's try again.

312
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,940
Okay.

313
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,420
Black

314
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,100
and white!

315
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,060
Chong, looks like we're roommates.

316
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,490
We'll share a room, then.

317
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,250
Here's a heads-up:

318
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,220
I snore.

319
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,250
You'd better

320
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,890
get to bed early.

321
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,300
Alright.

322
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,220
Okay.

323
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,420
We're taking the bigger room.

324
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,340
You made my face

325
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,340
look huge.

326
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,890
What? You look adorable.

327
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,220
Yiming just sent me the group photos.

328
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,530
Let me see.

329
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,180
You're the only one that looks good.

330
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,770
Look at me. My face is totally distorted.

331
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,610
Oh, you look good no matter what.

332
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,980
Wait a second.

333
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,730
You two are really close in this shot.

334
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,730
Things are heating up between you two, huh?

335
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,940
We're okay.

336
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,770
Be honest.

337
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,730
Has Shan Chong

338
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,650
given you

339
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,980
any real signals

340
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,250
or something like that?

341
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,420
Uh, I don't think so.

342
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,420
Seriously?

343
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,580
You two are

344
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,370
glued together every day.

345
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,580
I thought you already...

346
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,820
It's okay, Zhi.

347
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,010
Just don't get ahead of yourself.

348
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,340
Look, his legs

349
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,060
are so long.

350
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,770
Chong,

351
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,770
Beici told me

352
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,940
you guys come to Lezhou every year.

353
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,650
Yeah, we follow

354
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,650
the snow for work.

355
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,580
This time, we brought Wei Zhi along

356
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,370
so she could get

357
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,490
some inspiration.

358
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,220
So, you guys must know

359
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,340
all the fun stuff to do here.

360
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,890
Oh, there's plenty to do.

361
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,610
You can

362
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,940
go night snowboarding,

363
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,730
see foxes,

364
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,730
or even ride horses.

365
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,370
So many options!

366
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,490
What should we do first tomorrow?

367
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,420
Let's start with horseback riding.

368
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,490
I've never done that

369
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,180
in the snow before.

370
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,820
Why not see the foxes first?

371
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,420
Foxes are way rarer.

372
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,850
We have to go night snowboarding first.

373
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,010
It's the best.

374
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:13,940
It's okay.

375
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,490
We can do

376
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,490
whatever we feel like tomorrow.

377
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,420
Night snowboarding?

378
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,460
Haven't you snowboarded enough already?

379
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,250
Here, I've sliced the naan.

380
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,730
Put it there.

381
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,820
Thanks.

382
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,130
Dr. Jiang, this is some

383
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,340
surgeon-level naan slicing!

384
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,490
You noticed?

385
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,300
It's nothing.

386
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,890
There's

387
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,780
spicy, non-spicy,

388
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,820
cumin-flavored, and rose-flavored naan.

389
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,530
Help yourselves.

390
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,460
Hold up, Coach!

391
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,010
Wait.

392
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,300
Is this spicy?

393
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,460
Zhi can't eat it.

394
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,370
She can't handle

395
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,580
salty or spicy food

396
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,940
Hua.

397
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,580
No worries.

398
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,060
I'll take this one.

399
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,610
Back when we were kids,

400
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,770
Zhi's parents were always busy,

401
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,700
so she used

402
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,730
to tag along with Nanfeng

403
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,180
and have meals at our place.

404
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,100
She's always had a weak stomach.

405
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,340
She can't eat anything

406
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,180
too salty or spicy.

407
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,650
Try this one, Zhi.

408
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,130
It's rose-flavored.

409
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,650
Here.

410
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,820
Thanks, Yiming.

411
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,180
This is so good!

412
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,610
Yiming,

413
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,650
don't just serve everyone.

414
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,650
Start eating.

415
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,650
- Thank you, Zhi. - Come on, eat.

416
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,420
Try this.

417
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,300
The Big Plate Chicken here is amazing.

418
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,460
Here, Hua.

419
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,610
Try this naan.

420
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,890
- Mind your own food. - Here.

421
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,940
Zhi,

422
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,890
try this one.

423
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,220
Hot, hot!

424
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,820
Have some water.

425
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,130
Why did you give her a spicy one?

426
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,650
That was for you.

427
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,180
- It's burning! - Drink this, Zhi.

428
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,940
This will help.

429
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Spice tolerance is just like alcohol tolerance.

430
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,700
You have to build it up.

431
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,770
Oh, shut up.

432
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,820
Here, Beici.

433
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,730
Eat up.

434
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,700
Try the local Big Plate Chicken.

435
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,180
One should eat a bit

436
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,420
of everything for a balanced diet.

437
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,370
Right, Dr. Jiang?

438
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,220
That's right.

439
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,580
Thanks, Master.

440
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,100
Here.

441
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,980
Alright, folks,

442
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,250
let's raise our glasses!

443
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,300
Sure.

444
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,850
Let's do it.

445
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,100
What should we drink to?

446
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,060
To the beautiful Lezhou!

447
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,940
Yes!

448
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,180
To Lezhou!

449
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,650
Cheers!

450
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,940
My mouth is on fire.

451
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,940
So spicy.

452
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,850
Eat.

453
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,890
Here, Master.

454
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,890
Have a drumstick.

455
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,460
Yiming, eat.

456
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,580
Have some more of this, guys.

457
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,060
Here.

458
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,890
- Sliced naan. - No thanks.

459
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,730
It's too dry.

460
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,610
It's crispy.

461
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,610
This is too oily.

462
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,700
Have some vegetables.

463
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,340
Director Wang is right.

464
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,980
The patient's malignant lower-body tumor

465
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,890
has already spread

466
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,580
to surrounding tissues.

467
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,940
A local resection alone

468
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,730
won't be enough

469
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,890
to fully

470
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,980
remove it.

471
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,130
If the patient's bones

472
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,820
are too dense,

473
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,300
we'll need to use a power drill.

474
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,300
If that doesn't work, use hammers, saws, whatever it takes.

475
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,610
The case last month

476
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,490
used the same approach.

477
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,300
The patient

478
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
lost both legs,

479
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,580
but at least we saved his life.

480
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,250
There's

481
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,370
always a trade-off.

482
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,940
Alright,

483
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,980
that's it for today.

484
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,980
Let's move forward with this plan.

485
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,220
Wang, it's your first time

486
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,610
assisting in surgery,

487
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,420
so be well-prepared.

488
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,980
I'll be back in a few days.

489
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,820
See you all then.

490
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,010
Good work, everyone.

491
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,130
Why do you guys look so tense?

492
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,010
We're too cold to move a muscle.

493
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,940
Should we check out the foxes first tomorrow?

494
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,980
Sure, no problem.

495
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,130
Zhi kept

496
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,890
talking about them

497
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,850
at dinner.

498
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,530
Anything's fine,

499
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,220
as long as you're not bringing a drill

500
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,490
anywhere near our legs.

501
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,370
Well then, on behalf of Zhi,

502
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,980
thanks, guys.

503
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,700
You're welcome.

504
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,530
It's nothing.

505
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,980
By the way,

506
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,490
you seem

507
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,460
pretty close

508
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,460
to Zhi.

509
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,890
Are you relatives or something?

510
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,700
We seem close,

511
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,850
don't we?

512
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,530
As for our relationship,

513
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,300
how should I put it?

514
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,220
It's complicated.

515
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,730
It's okay.

516
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,220
We've got all night.

517
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:34,890
Tell us.

518
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,420
Yeah.

519
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,460
Well,

520
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,820
if I had to define it,

521
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,650
Zhi is the person

522
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,060
I want to protect for a lifetime.

523
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,940
You want to marry her?

524
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,940
Hey, don't just say it out loud.

525
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,460
Our parents already

526
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,420
gave their blessing,

527
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,340
but

528
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,460
I also respect Zhi's choice.

529
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,300
She's still young and clueless about these things.

530
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,290
I'll wait for her.

531
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,380
You're really committed.

532
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,010
What time is it? I'm getting sleepy.

533
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,090
Let me check the time.

534
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,380
Right.

535
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,290
- Time for bed. - It's getting late.

536
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,140
We really should sleep.

537
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,620
Alright,

538
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,330
I'm turning in, too.

539
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,810
Remember, we're seeing the foxes first tomorrow.

540
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,290
Got it.

541
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,380
- Good night. - Good night.

542
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,090
Beici,

543
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,620
aren't you coming?

544
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,090
I will in a bit.

545
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,730
Don't wait for me.

546
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,420
You go ahead.

547
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,290
Good night.

548
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,730
This is bad.

549
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,660
Master's got a rival!

550
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,700

574
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,730
Your eyes were open the whole ride.

575
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,380
Were you watching me?

576
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,050
Of course not.

577
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,330
I just happened to notice

578
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,570
while looking at the scenery.

579
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,460
- You... - I...

580
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,900
- You what? - I what?

581
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,420
I want to take you somewhere tomorrow.

582
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,220
See you at the entrance

583
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,940
at 10 AM.

584
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,050
Where's he taking me this time?

585
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,620
Does he think I'll go whenever he tells me to?

586
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,010
I've been to Lezhou so many times,

587
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,180
but I've never watched the sunrise here.

588
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,620
Now, join me, Beici,

589
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,980
for this breathtaking moment!

590
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,770
We're officially

591
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,420
sunrise-watching buddies!

592
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,250
Hey,

593
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,220
why isn't Zhi here

594
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,140
watching the sunrise with us?

595
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,850
She didn't mention anything to me.

596
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,860
Maybe she has other plans.

597
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,950
What could she possibly be doing?

598
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,580
The coach isn't here either.

599
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,940
Are they going somewhere together?

600
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,460
Maybe.

601
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,330
Maybe?

602
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,530
Don't you know where she went?

603
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,620
Wei Zhi is an adult.

604
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,630
I can't keep her on a leash

605
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,830
- all the time, right? - Look!

606
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,420
Look!

607
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,050
- The sun's coming up. - Look!

608
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,180
It's so beautiful.

609
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,420
The sun's out!

610
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,090

664
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,570
last year.

665
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,530
A fine horse.

666
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,620
Don't stand behind the horse.

667
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,180

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,660
which road were you

764
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,570
talking about?

765
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,860
The one right at the village entrance.

766
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,380
You said there were cars.

767
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,380
Was one of them

768
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,290
a black Jeep

769
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,180
with a "Bei B" license plate?

770
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,570
"Bei B"?

771
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,140
We just heard about it from someone else.

772
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,290
We're not sure.

773
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,490
Thanks.

774
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,380
There are quite a few people over there.

775
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,250
Go see for yourself.

776
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,220
The entrance to Fairyland, right?

777
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,860
Yes.

778
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,700
Nanfeng,

779
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,900
get to the Fairyland entrance

780
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,860
right now.

781
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,900
Why?

782
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,010
What happened?

783
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,570
Zhi...

784
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,660
What? What happened to Zhi?

785
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,460
Tell me!

786
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,570
They might have been caught in an avalanche.

787
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,140
An avalanche?

788
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:07,940
Yes.

789
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,140
I'm heading over now.

790
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,140
- Get there as soon as you can. - Alright.

791
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,860
See you there.

792
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,810
Master.

793
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,220
Master.

794
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,900
Master!

795
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,570
Master.

796
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,140
Master!

797
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,860
Master!

798
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,770
Master...

799
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,530
Shan Chong!

800
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,900
Shan Chong!

801
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,050
Shan Chong!

802
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,620
Master!

803
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,700
Master!

804
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,810
What are you doing?

805
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,530
What's wrong?

806
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,940
Hey, what are you doing?

807
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,490
Sir.

808
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:43,980
What's

809
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,960
the situation inside?

810
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,220
There was an avalanche.

811
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,860
But...

812
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,570
Calm down.

813
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,050
- Calm down, sir. - My friend is in there!

814
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,200
- I have to go find her! - Calm down.

815
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,780
- Sir. - I need to find her!

816
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,730
- I don't know if she's okay. - Calm down.

817
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,510
- I'm really worried about her. - Calm down.

818
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,620
Calm down, sir.

819
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,050
We can't let you in right now.

820
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,380
The avalanche just happened.

821
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,180
Jiang Yiming!

822
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,860
Yiming!

823
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,810
- Listen... - Yiming!

824
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,860
Please, officers, can't you make an exception?

825
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,730
Sir.

826
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,090
Sorry about my friend.

827
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,730
Uh,

828
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,810
officers,

829
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,980
what's the situation inside?

830
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,010
There was an avalanche.

831
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,940
No one is allowed to enter.

832
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,340
But our friends are in there.

833
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,420
When will we get any updates?

834
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,780
Yeah.

835
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,300
The avalanche wasn't too severe.

836
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,420
Don't worry too much.

837
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,050
You can't stay here.

838
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,130
You won't be able to help.

839
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Head back for now

840
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,460
We'll let you know

841
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,450
if there's any news.

842
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,170
Master!

843
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,420

844
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,940
Shan Chong!

845
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,650
Hey.

846
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,690
Give me your hand.

847
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,300
Thank goodness you're okay.

848
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,090
I'm fine.

849
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,860
I'm okay.

850
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,010
What's wrong?

851
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,650
Are you hurt?

852
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,050
I'm fine.

853
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,050

I'm fine.

857

The path we took is completely blocked.

858
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,130
There could be another avalanche.

859
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,940
We need to leave now.

860
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,210
I remember there's

861
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,090
a supply station nearby.

How are you feeling?

889
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,340
Any discomfort?

just a bit tired.

Is it here?

Let me see.

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,130
Does it hurt?

How could that be your fault?

901
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,780
You didn't know this would happen.

Mine's almost dead, too.

What do we do?

917
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,820

maybe it'll work again.

Are you okay?

00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,210
I'm fine.

935
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,420
We got caught

936
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,130
in an avalanche,

937
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,900
but we found

938
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,940
a forest ranger supply station nearby.

939
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,330
You really ran into an avalanche?

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:08,940
Master,

941
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,380
is the place you're staying safe?

942
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,090
Is it warm enough?

943
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,210
It's got everything

944
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,980
we need.

945
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,210
I'm so glad you guys are safe.

946
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,260
Zhi, do you know

947
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,980
how worried we were

948
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,460
when we couldn't reach you?

- Wei Zhi? - Chong?

956
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,130
Wei Zhi?

957
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,740
- No way. - Try again.

958
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,940
Hello?

959
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,490
The battery's dead.

960
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,460
Sorry,

961
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,940
the subscriber you dialed

962
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,130
cannot be connected for the moment.

963
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,780
Either they

964
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,530
lost signal,

965
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,780
or their phone ran out of battery.

966
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,010
At least we got to talk,

967
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,940
and we know they're safe.

968
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,840
- Yeah. - They're fine.

969
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,090
- Thank goodness we got through. - Don't worry.

970
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,490
My heart nearly stopped.

971
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,480
I'm exhausted.

972
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,210
I almost lost it.

973
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,340
Don't worry. I told you

974
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,570
Master would be fine.

975
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,610
I accidentally saw

976
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,210
your scar again just now.

977
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,860
Master,

978
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,010
there's actually

979
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,260
something I've always wanted to ask you.

980
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,610
What is it?

981
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,610
I want to ask...

982
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,340
I want to ask you...

983
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,900
You want to know why I retired?

984
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,490
How did you know?

985
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,690
Are you really that curious about my story?

986
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,130
Of course.

987
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,780
I care about you.

988
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,780
Shan lost her legs

989
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,090
because of me.

[Snowy Classroom
Snowboarding Basics - Part 1]

991
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,340
As a beginner,

992
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,690
how do you get up

993
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,690
when sitting on the slope?

994
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,340
First,

995
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,780
place one hand on the snow for support.

996
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,420
Then,

997
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,900
use the other hand to grab your snowboard.

998
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,650
Push yourself up like this,

999
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,900
and you'll be able to stand up smoothly.

1000
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,460
Once you're up,

1001
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,260
you can try heel edge sideslip.

1002
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,860
Here's a tip.

1003
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,210
Press your calves against the highbacks of your bindings.

1004
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,940
Lower your center of gravity slightly.

1005
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,340
Keep your head up and gaze forward.

1006
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,260
Don't look down at your feet.

1007
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,420
Now,

1008
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,690
try to feel as if you're stepping on

1009
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,460
and easing off the gas pedal with your feet

1010
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,260
until you achieve a steady, controlled skid.

1011
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,740
That's heel edge sideslip works.

1012
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,010
After mastering this,

1013
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,940
you can start

1014
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,460
practicing heel-side falling leaf.

1015
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,940
Similar to the heel edge sideslip,

1016
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,090
Your hand direction

1017
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,260
determines where you're going.

1018
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,900
Head positioning and gaze are key.

1019
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,130
Look straight ahead,

1020
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,780
and you'll come to a natural stop.

1021
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,940
Look left,

1022
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,490
and you'll slide left.

1023
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,130
Look forward again,

1024
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,650
and you'll stop again.

1025
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,940
With enough practice,

1026
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,210
you'll quickly master

1027
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,780
heel-side falling leaf.

1028
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,780
Now, as a beginner,

1029
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,170
what should you do

1030
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,300
if you fall backward on the slope?

1031
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,740
Never use your hands to brace yourself against the snow.

1032
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,420
Instead, cross your arms over your chest,

1033
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,820
lower your center of gravity,

1034
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,860
and let your hips take the impact

1035
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,300
when landing on the snow.

1036
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,010
This posture

1037
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,300
minimizes the risk of injury.

1038
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,210
Keep this in mind!

1039
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,130
