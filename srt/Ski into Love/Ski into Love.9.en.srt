00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,460
Yes!

196
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,100
Are you on a lunch break?

197
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,810
Yes.

198
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,540
Then let's go have lunch.

199
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,170
Okay!

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,850
Let's go.

201
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,660
I'll take you there.

202
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,140
Okay.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,490
Yummy.

204
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,050
Eat more.

205
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,930
I can't eat anymore.

206
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,610
The rest is all yours.

207
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,810
Come on.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,460
I thought it was a client.

209
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,660
Why do you both keep

210
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,700
using that excuse?

211
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,290
Both?

212
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,220
Who else came to see you?

213
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,250
Wei Zhi?

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,170
She came yesterday.

215
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,980
Why did she come?

216
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,290
Asked you to return as her assistant?

217
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,540
You know about the competition?

218
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,370
I know a little.

219
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,290
It seems she wants to start

220
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,930
a new series on snowboarding.

221
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,540
So she chose

222
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,730
an unpopular topic.

223
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,770
Manman,

224
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,530
what brings you here?

225
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,530
Elephant,

226
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,890
I came here for the same reason.

227
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,130
But I want to do figure skating.

228
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,650
You know figure skating?

229
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,730
This topic

230
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,700
is better

231
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,650
than Wei Zhi's

232
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,650
and has more potential to win.

233
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,700
Elephant.

234
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,890
Let's team up, okay?

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,010
Alright.

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,250
Since you've chosen Wei Zhi, forget it.

237
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,730
I'm full, I'm leaving.

238
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,610
Manman,

239
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,530
why?

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,250
Why have we

241
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,370
ended up like this?

242
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,370
You should

243
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,300
ask Wei Zhi.

244
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,060
Maybe there is

245
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,180
a misunderstanding.

246
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,820
Let's clear it up together.

247
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,180
And we are still a team.

248
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,850
Let's work together.

249
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,820
Let's join

250
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,460
the competition together,

251
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,010
okay?

252
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,180
Maybe there is a misunderstanding,

253
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,300
but it doesn't matter anymore.

254
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,300
Why doesn't it matter?

255
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,890
Elephant,

256
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,180
you're always so naive.

257
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,370
I'll tell you now,

258
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,420
we can't go back.

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,650
How can we not go back?

260
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,220
Wei Zhi said...

261
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,730
do you know

262
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,370
who inherited

263
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,300
the pen name, Zhai?

264
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,770
Do you know

265
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,060
who's continued the Farewell Song?

266
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,100
It's me.

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,820
I took everything from Wei Zhi.

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,850
So we can't go back.

269
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,700
Do you understand now?

270
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,300
Elephant,

271
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,250
I've changed my mind.

272
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,300
I will draw snowboarding, too.

273
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,460
Since we can't

274
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,130
be teammates,

275
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,730
let's be rivals.

276
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,650
What?

277
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,060
Are you sure Wei Zhi is also joining the competition?

278
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,730
Yes, Mr. Wang.

279
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,300
I've thought it over,

280
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,610
and I'm switching

281
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,650
to snowboarding.

282
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,370
I don't think I'm worse than Wei Zhi.

283
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,980
Alright.

284
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,580
Whatever you want to draw,

285
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,060
just talk to Zhang Yu.

286
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,730
Got it?

287
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,340
You don't have to tell me.

288
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,010
My goal is to win the championship.

289
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,940
Got it?

290
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,530
What you draw doesn't matter.

291
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,980
Stupid girl.

292
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,610
Making trouble...

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,530
Call our lawyer here.

294
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,580
What did you do

295
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,770
last night?

296
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,130
Nothing.

297
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,220
I can't tell you

298
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,820
I stayed up all night writing a story outline.

299
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,220
You stayed up drawing comics again, didn't you?

300
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,220
When will you stop

301
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,820
with these childish things

302
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300
and do something serious?

303
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,010
I've told you so many times.

304
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,890
This isn't some childish hobby.

305
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,460
It's a serious profession.

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,460
Enough.

307
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,850
I don't want to hear it.

308
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,850
Hello.

309
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,770
Zhi!

310
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,250
Hi!

311
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,940
Hello.

312
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,460
Sorry to keep you waiting, Auntie.

313
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,490
Not at all.

314
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,610
We just arrived.

315
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,820
- Hi.
- Auntie.

316
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,940
Jiang Nanfeng!

317
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,370
Great.

318
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,890
Good.

319
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,420
No rush.

320
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,100
We just arrived.

321
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,820
We have umbrellas.

322
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,940
No rush, take your time.

323
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,490
Auntie.

324
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,490
Look at Yiming,

325
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,010
he's getting more mature.

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,180
So reliable.

327
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,130
Really?

328
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,340
Not like our little troublemaker at home,

329
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,700
always restless and impulsive.

330
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,060
I'm telling you,

331
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,890
you should

332
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,370
find someone

333
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,300
like Yiming

334
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,220
to keep you in check.

335
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,460
Him?

336
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,820
Do you really think

337
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,370
he can keep me under control?

338
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,180
Auntie, I don't think I can manage that.

339
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,890
There's a family rule in the Jiang family,

340
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,180
after marriage,

341
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,060
the husband listens to the wife.

342
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,420
What a coincidence!

343
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,580
Lately, I've been

344
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,250
into domineering men.

345
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,100
The kind who keeps me in check.

346
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,060
You know it!

347
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,850
Look at them.

348
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,420
He's about to become a domineering guy

349
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,370
and keep you in line.

350
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,850
Who are you helping, Jiang Nanfeng?

351
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,180
Just kidding. He won't keep you in check.

352
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,770
Let's go.

353
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,490
Let's go.

354
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,700
Keep you in check!

355
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,250
Come on.

356
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,130
Shan Chong?

357
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,460
Chong?

358
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,250
Why are you here?

359
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,100
What a small world!

360
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,420
Can I shake your hand?

361
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,180
Hello, hello.

362
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm your big fan.

363
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,700
I watched all your matches.

364
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,940
Thanks.

365
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,130
Why did you

366
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,220
suddenly retire?

367
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,490
On the day you announced it,

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,460
I cried for three days!

369
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,180
Such a shame.

370
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,890
Enough.

371
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,700
Sorry,

372
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,420
my boyfriend got a bit too excited.

373
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,700
Sorry to disturb you.

374
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,650
Beibei.

375
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,580
Chong,

376
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,820
if you make a comeback,

377
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,130
I'll be your biggest supporter!

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,650
Let's go.

379
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,460
Chong, bye!

380
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,580
Okay, thanks.

381
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Thanks, Chong.

382
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,490
Chong,

383
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,820
no offense, I just want to know...

384
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,850
Do you

385
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,730
have any plans to come back?

386
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,850
I've thought about it.

387
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,700
Are you serious?

388
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,980

Why do you want to go there?

440

To learn snowboarding.

441
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,340

Are you going there to learn snowboarding,

448

449

466
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,700

Besides,

582
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,730
I think if she sees you now,

583
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,290
she will

584
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,420
feel even more upset.

585
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,980
As her friend,

586
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,860
you should care about her!

587
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,180
You...

588
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,220
Let go, I'll do it myself.

589
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,900
So annoying.

590
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,570

591
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,860

Zhi?

595
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,180
Zhi?

596
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,730
See?

597
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,770
I told you she wasn't here.

598
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,180
Where is she?

599
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,180
You must know.

600
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,660
Tell me!

601
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,860
I really don't know.

602
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm not her mom.

603
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,010
Even her mom doesn't know where she is.

604
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,010
Her mom asked me, too.

605
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,380
This is weird.

606
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,050
Where is she?

607
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,490
She's grown up,

608
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,090
so she'll be fine.

609
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,490
You should spend more time

610
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,330
caring about me.

611
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,530

612
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,140

Thank you for coming with me.

615
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,050
Come on.

616
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,770
I took a leave.

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,570
Not a big deal.

618
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,570
Read the story outline

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,530
I sent you.

620
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,660
I want to gather

621
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,180
more information in Xicheng this time.

622
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:36,980
BTW,

623
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,010
let's have

624
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,330
a video meeting with Shan later.

625
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,530
Sure, no problem.

626
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,570
Zhi,

627
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,090
I might have caused some trouble.

628
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,140
What's wrong?

629
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,490
This morning, Wu Manman came to see me.

630
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,980
I just blurted everything out.

631
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,810
She knows we're joining the competition.

632
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,090
It's fine.

633
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,290
What's the big deal?

634
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,330
But do you know

635
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,940
that your pen name and Farewell Song

636
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,330
were stolen by her?

637
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,010
I wouldn't call it stealing.

638
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,860
I was a bit angry at first

639
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,050
when I found out.

640
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,660
But then I thought about it.

641
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,940
She kind of gave

642
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,290
Farewell Song an ending.

643
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,290
Alright,

644
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,290
Let's look forward.

645
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,900
You may stop here.

646
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,570

647
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,380
Okay.

648
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,380

650
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,460
Okay.

651
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,460
Just a quick report.

652
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,330
I'm heading to Xicheng for information gathering.

653
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,770

654
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,770

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,090
to be our technical advisor.

657
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,180

658
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,010

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,340
Thanks.

775
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,730
Sit.

776
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,490
Hello, everyone.

777
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,780
Zhi!

778
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,210
Hua, good to see you again!

779
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,650
Thank you for your food.

780
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,620
You're welcome.

781
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,490
Had a good sleep?

782
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,540
Yes.

783
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,650
Look at our wonderful breakfast!

784
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,380
Cheers, Zhi!

785
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,010
Hello, Yan.

786
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,690
Thank you.

787
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,540
You're welcome.

788
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,300
Welcome, Zhi.

789
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,060
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

790
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,820
Stop eating, Beici.

791
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,300
Not asking about Jiang Nanfeng at all.

792
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,250
Seems like he knows

793
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,620
that he was deleted by her.

794
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,410
But he doesn't seem upset about it.

795
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,250
I don't get it.

796
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,380
The youngest child gets all the love from their dad.

797
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,100
As for us, those who are stuck

798
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,140
in between,

799
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,580
I'm afraid that one day

800
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,450
my dad will ask me,

801
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,210
"Who are you?

802
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,410
Where are you?"

803
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,900
Say one more word,

804
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,900
you'll be kicked out.

805
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,380
Master.

806
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,250
Come on.

807
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,690
Have breakfast.

808
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,060
Come on.

809
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,100
Morning, Master.

810
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,780
Morning.

811
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,100
Breakfast.

812
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,340
Just one more.

813
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,930
Chong?

814
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,860
What a small world!

815
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,060
You live here, too?

816
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,340
What a small world!

817
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,380
BTW, Chong,

818
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,100
can I ask you something?

819
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,690
Well,

820
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,210
do you teach?

821
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,650
Could you teach me a bit?

822
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,170
I do teach.

823
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,300
But not for beginners.

824
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,540
How's your level?

825
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,410
He's not good but he has a big ambition.

826
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,450
Then maybe I can't teach you.

827
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,170
It's okay.

828
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,210
I understand.

829
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,690
How about this?

830
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,010
Let me add you on WeChat.

831
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,380
If there's a competition in the future,

832
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,620
I'll get you a ticket.

833
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,250
Really?

834
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,250
Chong.

835
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,340
What competition?

836
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,900
An internal competition.

837
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,450
I'll be your fan for life.

838
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,690
Chong.

839
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,820
I'm your big fan.

840
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,620
I'm off then.

841
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,010
Bye.

842
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,970
Chong, bye.

843
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,780
Bye.

844
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,450
Bye.

845
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,250
Chong,

846
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,490
if you don't teach beginners,

847
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,010
how will you teach me?

848
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,650
I won't teach you.

849
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,410
In case you will be carried away by wolves.

850
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,730
I don't even know

851
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,100
where to rent a wheelchair at this ski resort.

852
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,900
Don't say things like that.

853
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,450
Good luck.

854
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,380
Good luck, good luck.

855
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,010
Come on, eat.

856
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,340
She doesn't let me eat, Master.

857
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,820
Here, it's cold.

858
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:06,100
[Dangerous Stunts. Do not attempt]

859
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,900
The most fun thing after snowboarding

860
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,540
is playing games.

861
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,170
Let's play games.

862
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,450
Play games!

863
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:18,930
It's so fun.

864
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,060
Don't you feel tired?

865
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,650
Hua, Hua.

866
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,250
The King of Fighters '97!

867
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,730
Listen, bros,

868
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,410
don't play anything else.

869
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,380
Let's play a fun game.

870
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,410
Stop it.

871
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,340
Stop it.

872
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:28,970
Come on.

873
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,300
You are so sweet.

874
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,930
I just started.

875
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,060
I just inserted the coin.

876
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,930
Stop it!

877
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,970
So exhausted.

878
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,540
I just sat down.

879
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,490
Come on, take a seat.

880
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,820
What are we playing?

881
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,820
Let's play

882
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,100
a big

883
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,340
bomb.

884
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,620
Aren't you afraid the phone will break?

885
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,300
You've won the lottery?

886
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,780
It's okay.

887
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,540
The rule of the game:

888
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,970
When you get the bomb,

889
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,690
you must answer

890
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,690
the previous person's question.

891
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,250
When you pass it down,

892
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,450
you must ask a question.

893
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,380
Then, when the time on the phone

894
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,900
hits zero in someone's hands,

895
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,250
it will go off.

896
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,250
And they'll have to take the punishment.

897
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,140
Okay?

898
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,650
Okay.

899
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,100
I'm so unlucky,

900
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,410
Maybe I will get the boom.

901
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,930
No, no, no, Zhi.

902
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,060
Before you came,

903
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,820
the loser

904
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,140
in this game was only one person,

905
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,170
which was

906
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,780
Chong.

907
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,820
Really?

908
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,780
Who's

909
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,490
more unlucky than Master?

910
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,860
Zhi, then,

911
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,650
you start first.

912
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,930
Hurry up, the first question.

913
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,060
Hurry.

914
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,340
When did you first

915
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,930
teach me snowboarding?

916
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,580
November 2.

917
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,690
Seriously?

918
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,540
What is a rodeo outside spin

919
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,490
with a Nollie

920
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,970
on toeside big air?

921
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,900
It's easy.

922
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,820
Hurry, ask me.

923
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,010
Hurry up!

924
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,210
Ask quickly!

925
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,450
A simple question.

926
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,620
How many strokes are in my name?

927
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,300
You...

928
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,970
Yan, 17 strokes.

929
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,690
My real name!

930
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,410
You didn't say it.

931
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,900
My turn.

932
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,340
Who was the first

933
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,620
Chinese Olympic gold medalist?

934
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,210
Xu Haifeng.

935
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,250
You even know this!

936
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,100
The first Chinese astronaut

937
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,300
entered space...

938
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,860
Yang Liwei.

939
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,690
I haven't finished.

940
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,210
What's the date when China's

941
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,010
first astronaut

942
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,570
successfully

943
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,410
entered space?

944
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,050
I remember it was 2003.

945
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,340
And the date?

946
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't remember it.

947
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,090
What date?

948
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,380
What date?

949
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,740
One, two, three...

950
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,660
Five, six...

951
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,410
Nine,

952
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,450
ten.

953
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,660
Alright, enough.

954
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,340
The whole world...

955
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,610
Hua, why are you so round?

956
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,900
How many bones are in the human body?

957
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,660
207.

958
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,820
No,

959
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,220
206.

960
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,740
You...

961
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,740
When you gave it to me,

962
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,300
it was already like this.

963
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,860
Beici,

964
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,220
why do you always target Zhi?

965
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,900
No, I didn't...

966
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,860
Forget it, not funny.

967
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,410
I quit.

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,700
You targeted me...

970
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,780
Let's go. Leave them alone.

971
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,970
I admit my failure.

972
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,300
I accept your challenge.

973
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,900
Let's go.

974
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:43,970
Then...

975
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,820
Are you in, Beici?

976
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,660
I'll...

977
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,970
Alright, okay.

978
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,970
I admit defeat.

979
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,930
Next time.

980
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,090
Next time, I won't let you go.

981
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,900
Let's go.

982
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,180
Bye.

983
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,180
Bye, Master.

984

Bye.

985
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,450
Beici,

986
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,660
how could you bully Zhi

987
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,780
in front of Chong?

988
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,660
Wish you safety.

989
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,530
You can't read the air at all!

990
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,220
Let's go.

991
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,180
You ruined the game.

992
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,380
I'd rather play The King of Fighters!

993
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,090
So annoying.

994
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,010
Calling my spy.

995
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,900
Did Ms. Yang get pissed off because of me?

996
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,660
Come on.

997
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,780
Your mom is someone who's experienced

998
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,530
big storms.

999
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,820
She won't be pissed off for you.

1000
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,380
But she didn't reply to my messages.

1001
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,930
Babe,

1002
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,930
not getting pissed off and not being mad

1003
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,970
are different.

1004
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,740
[Good luck to you]

1005
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:44,860

to welcome you,

1007
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,010
I'll treat you to a barbecue.

1008
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,700
Thanks.

1009
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,610
But I can't let you pay the bill.

1010
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,930
Not a big deal.

1011
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,610
Don't stand on ceremony.

1012
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,970
Beici,

1013
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,130
I will design

1014
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,010
a character for you.

1015

How many flowers are there in this garden?

1021
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,570
I'm asking you,

1022
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,530
how many flowers are there in this garden?

1023
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,700
Be specific.

1024
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,930
Answer me.

1025
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,740
Five seconds.

Use him to feed the bears.

1028
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,450
Yes.

What?

1034
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,820
Check this.

1035
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,490
See what I've found!

1036
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,530
Master, have a look.

1037
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,260
You will be interested in it.

1038
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,010
I've found Zhi's secret account.

1039
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,970
Secret account?

1040
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,570
Check out this.

[Useless guy. Use him to feed the bears.]
Feed the bears!

1042
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,450
[Yes. My lady.]
A stupid gardener,

1043
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,130
isn't he just like me?

1044
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,900
And this butler, Dai,

isn't he just like you?

1046
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,010
Really?

1047
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,860
Yes!

1048
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,050
He has a wristband, too.

1049
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,180
Look, exactly the same.

1050
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,220
Do you know how I found it?

1051
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,900
It's from platform push notifications about nearby content.

1052
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,930
Look at the name.

1053
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,050

1057
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,490
"Zhi" means Branch.

This person can draw comics

1059
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,300

Most importantly,

1061
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,260
I just answered the question wrong,

1065
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,570
So,

1066
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,340
it must be her secret account!
