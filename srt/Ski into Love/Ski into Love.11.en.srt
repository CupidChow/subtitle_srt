You're drunk.

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,220
Where's the room card?

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,940
Did you bring it?

195
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,250
You... It tickles.

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,770
What are you doing?

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,770
Get in.

198
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,850
Wei Zhi.

199
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,460
What's Jiang Yiming

200
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,420
to you?

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,980
Jiang Yiming is a handsome guy

202
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,300
in my neighborhood.

203
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,460
He just came back from studying abroad.

204
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,060
You usually call him handsome?

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,010
Why are you so mean?

206
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,250
Are you angry?

207
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,770
I'm not.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,820
Come on. Let's go.

209
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,420
Sit down.

210
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,370
What's wrong with you?

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,730
Are you still upset?

212
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,530
No, I'm not.

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,650
I won't call him that anymore.

214
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,010
I don't want to be misunderstood,

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,980
especially by you.

216
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,060
♪Hold me, kingdom in snow we met♪

217
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,460
♪I stumble upon tides in the stillness♪

218
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,440
♪The paintbrush reveals a secret♪

219
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,890
♪I came close to you in the mirror of snow♪

220
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,760
♪The next story dialogue♪

221
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,700
♪When the bonfire blooms♪

222
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,970
♪Exists because of you♪

223
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,290
♪You are the answer to my riddle♪

224
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,180
Where's Zhi?

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,250
Put your hand down.

226
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,460
Where's Zhi?

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,250
Zhi.

228
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,610
Whatever.

229
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,490
Zhi.

230
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,100
Let's go.

231
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,770
Thank you.

232
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,060
You're welcome.

233
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,010
You have a class tomorrow.

234
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,130
Get an early night.

235
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,180
Good night.

236
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Good night.

237
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,940
Wei Zhi.

238
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,460
Why did you

239
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,180
bring me here so early

240
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,060
in the morning?

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,770
I found another coach for you last night.

242
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,300
Another coach?

243
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,420
What coach?

244
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,820
Are you still

245
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,770
not sober yet?

246
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,340
But if he can come,

247
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,300
it'll prove I'm sober.

248
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,300
Where's another coach?

249
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,530
He doesn't want to come?

250
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,420
Where's my student?

251
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,180
Your goggles are nice.

252
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,340
I gave them to her.

253
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,610
What?

254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,370
Your goggles

255
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,530
are what your master won

256
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,490
for you from him.

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,460
By the way,

258
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,340
I have a lot of matching gear at home.

259
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,580
I won't use them anymore anyway,

260
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,300
so I can sell them all

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,010
to you.

262
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,730
Why are you looking at me?

263
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,490
He's your chosen one.

264
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,420
Discount?

265
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,250
Yes.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,420
So,

267
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,340
scan my WeChat QR code.

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,820
Your master has my WeChat.

269
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,220
You can ask him to share my account with you.

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,700
No indoor or night training.

271
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,490
One pair is enough.

272
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,650
Let's go.

273
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,460
Get the equipment.

274
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,010
See you later.

275
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,370
Let's go.

276
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,730
Your level?

277
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,890
Basic S-turn.

278
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,890
Did Yan teach you that?

279
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,220
I remember I saw you

280
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,530
learning toeside falling leaf and C-turn

281
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,060
at Beishan last week.

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,820
It's been over a week now, right?

283
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,060
But why are you still learning basic S-turn?

284
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,730
I don't think it's bad.

285
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,940
How long have you been learning?

286
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,580
Five or six days,

287
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,460
but I ski once or twice a day

288
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,820
and take the occasional vacation,

289
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,460
so really,

290
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,010
I haven't been studying very long.

291
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,770
Wait a minute.

292
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,980
In six days,

293
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,460
you only learned

294
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,820
the basic S-turn from scratch?

295
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,730
Yes.

296
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,650
So

297
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,460
did he charge you?

298
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,250
He didn't later.

299
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,610
Stupid.

300
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,730
Listen to me.

301
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,980
I suggest you

302
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,060
go to the police now.

303
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,580
He's scamming you.

304
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,700
Give me the skis.

305
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,650
No need.

306
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,700
I can get them myself.

307
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,730
Do you think I care about your skis?

308
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,010
I didn't mean it like that.

309
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,100
Yes, sir.

310
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,010
I'm good.

311
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,460
Before I teach you to ski today,

312
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm going to give you

313
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,370
a theory lesson.

314
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,490
Those who can't ski

315
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,610
must not be able to teach others,

316
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,850
but those who can

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,130
may not, either.

318
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,650
If you meet someone bad at teaching again,

319
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,060
I suggest you change instructors right away.

320
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,610
He seems to be talking about you.

321
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,060
Don't waste your time and money.

322
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,580
Learned a lot.

323
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,730
Not that way.

324
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,060
That's not for someone at your level.

325
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,890
This way.

326
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,130
I'm actually pretty good,

327
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,650
okay?

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,340
Okay.

329
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,890
Sir, where are we going?

330
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,100
Wait for me here.

331
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,130
I forgot my stuff.

332
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,850
Get your stuff.

333
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,730
Master.

334
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,730
You're finally out.

335
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,250
I'm dying of thirst.

336
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,010
Let me get a bottle of water.

337
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,530
Chong.

338
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,370
Why is Dai Duo here?

339
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,340
That's right.

340
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,340
Have you seen him?

341
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,130
He's giving lessons to Jiang Nanfeng.

342
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,980
When did Dai Duo

343
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,980
give lessons?

344
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,610
Wei Zhi talked to him

345
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,250
for half an hour at midnight yesterday.

346
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,300
That's why.

347
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,010
But

348
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,850
why didn't you

349
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,890
tell me then?

350
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,220
Wait a minute.

351
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,250
Why are you angry?

352
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,340
He didn't take her on as an apprentice

353
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,610
or develop another relationship with her.

354
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,530
It's her right to have anyone

355
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,460
as her coach, isn't it?

356
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,010
All right.

357
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,980
Get ready to teach.

358
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,980
Don't let your emotions get the best of you.

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,420
Got it.

360
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,940
But if you want

361
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,420
to get better,

362
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,420
I suggest you

363
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,060
firm up your edge control.

364
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,730
You're still on sideslip.

365
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,890
You should make your edge go through this route.

366
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,580
I think it's not bad overall,

367
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,730
but there's actually a little...

368
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,490
Yes, sir. I'm pretty good at this.

369
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,220
I learned to use this ski car,

370
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,850
sorry, ski lift before.

371
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,820
I learned boardslide before.

372
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,060
I think I did okay.

373
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,180
Today I want

374
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,060
to learn 360° turn.

375
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,820
Can you teach me?

376
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,010
Okay.

377
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,340
But I haven't seen you

378
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,620
teach anyone before.

379
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,290
That's your good fortune.

380
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,700
I don't usually teach.

381
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,770
Then I must thank

382
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,900
my dear Zhi.

383
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,090
What are you doing?

384
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,220
So sneaky.

385
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,250
Now, Yan

386
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,620
is forcing a smile,

387
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,660
but I just heard

388
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,700
that Yan and Hu

389
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,810
bumped into Dai Duo

390
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,940
and Nanfeng there.

391
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,380
Dai Duo was very sarcastic

392
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,220
and said in front of Yan

393
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,140
that Nanfeng only learned

394
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,090
S-turn in 6 days.

395
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,460
He also advised her to go to the police.

396
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,180
You didn't see Yan's face at that time.

397
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,330
You seemed quite happy.

398
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,140
She only learned S-turn in six days,

399
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,290
but you?

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,330
You seem to be good at slowing down with your butt.

401
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,090
You could form a team

402
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,700
with Jiang Nanfeng.

403
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,570
Maybe the police

404
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,220
can set up a task force for you.

405
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm different from her.

406
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,620
Different?

407
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,770
Different in what way?

408
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,460
Do you have an arm or a leg less than her?

409
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,090
You don't charge.

410
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,420
So because I don't charge you,

411
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,090
you won't take it seriously, right?

412
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,380
Today, I'll teach you the basic S-turn.

413
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,570
You must master it

414
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,530
before the sun goes down.

415
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,980
So

416
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,570
will I get any reward if I master it?

417
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,180
Yes.

418
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,570
I'll forget about your drunken tantrum

419
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,860
last night.

420
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,180
And if I don't master it?

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,290
We both die.

422
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,810
That's scary.

423
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,050
By the way, there's one more problem.

424
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,900
I think normally, your center of gravity

425
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,770
is a little too far back.

426
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,220
Sir.

427
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,050
Why is Dai Duo

428
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,810
teaching a newbie, too?

429
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,620
She's not a newbie.

430
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,660
She has basic skills.

431
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,570
Your center of gravity has to be placed in the middle.

432
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,860
Sometimes it's too far back,

433
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,620
and sometimes it's too far forward.

434
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,180
They're all wrong because then

435
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,180
your center of gravity will be unstable.

436
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,700
Right. So you have to keep it in the center.

437
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,620
Okay. Let's go.

438
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's go.

439
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,380
This time, I'll show you.

440
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,620
I'm too full.

441
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,460
Dai Duo.

442
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,570
It's a real torture chamber.

443
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,810
Don't be mad.

444
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,620
I just want to find Nanfeng

445
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,770
a better coach.

446
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,980
I wanted to ask for your help at first,

447
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,010
but I saw Dai Duo

448
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,770
sitting in the corner yesterday.

449
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,460
What a coincidence.

450
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,730
So?

451
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,620
So

452
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,250
don't get upset when you

453
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,490
hear Dai Duo's name or see him.

454
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,620
Don't worry.

455
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,420
Don't be jealous.

456
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,530
I won't change my coach.

457
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,420
When did you

458
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,330
see me get jealous?

459
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,660
You didn't?

460
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,860
Of course not.

461
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,660
Okay.

462
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm at such a low level,

463
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,420
so you can find me

464
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,530
another coach, too.

465
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,050
You're learning S-turn now,

466
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,980
and so will you

467
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,220
for the next ten or twenty days.

468
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,250
You can practice on your own while I'm gone.

469
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,980
You don't need another coach.

470
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,620
You're not jealous.

471
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,140
Your center of gravity.

472
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,420
Right. Keep it in the middle.

473
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,980
That's good.

474
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,810
That's good.

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,700
That's good.

476
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,330
That's good.

477
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,380
Jiang Nanfeng.

478
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,570
What?

479
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,180
Stop.

480
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,700
I think

481
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,940
you're skiing okay,

482
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,860
but if you

483
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,290
want to get better

484
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,940
at the S-turn,

485
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,980
you need to learn

486
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,980
the closed turn.

487
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,940
Closed turn?

488
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,380
Yes.

489
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,810
I'll show you now.

490
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,420
Okay.

491
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,330
Fingers in this direction.

492
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,290
Yeah, like that.

493
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,810
Lower your center of gravity.

494
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,570
Come down.

495
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,660
Right away.

496
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,420
Center of gravity.

497
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,050
Got it?

498
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,250
That route

499
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,090
has more arc.

500
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,900
Yeah.

501
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,530
It's good that you can see the difference

502
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,290
between them.

503
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,530
Now you need to correct the trajectory

504
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,250
and course of your sliding.

505
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,770
As you turn,

506
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,490
you need to extend your body

507
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,180
and lower your center of gravity

508
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,730
to better assist yourself

509
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,730
with edge control.

510
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,290
Actually,

511
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,050
in simple terms, a closed turn is

512
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,180
when you skate with the toe edge

513
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,620
by turning your body...

514
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,980
A fall line is like this.

515
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,810
Do you know the fall line?

516
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,860
The fall line?

517
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,620
Yeah.

518
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,010
When you pass the fall line,

519
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,460
lift the heel edge to slide forward.

520
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:24,860
Right.

521
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,810
This way of turning

522
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,810
helps you better control

523
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,900
the force you put

524
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,460
into your forward motion

525
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,810
and the speed of your descent.

526
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,490
Okay.

527
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,220
Try it.

528
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,140
No problem.

529
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,530
We can finally take a break.

530
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,290
Jiang.

531
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,980
Your center of gravity.

532
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,620
Make it in the middle.

533
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,220
Master.

534
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,250
Why do I think

535
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,220
you two are a bit alike?

536
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,380
You do.

537
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,770
Are they brothers?

538
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,620
Of course not.

539
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,730
Maybe because they're both masters.

540
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,900
Zhi.

541
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,860
We're wasting time

542
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,530
standing here,

543
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,700
so let me take you skiing for a while.

544
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,250
I'm pretty skillful now.

545
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,010
No need.

546
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,250
Look at your best friend.

547
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,220
She learned edge-switching at Beishan.

548
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,810
She hasn't been skiing for a few days

549
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,900
and hasn't practiced,

550
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,530
but with a bit of coaching,

551
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,900
she can now switch edges smoothly.

552
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,940
If she'd taken up skiing ten years earlier,

553
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,860
she might even have made it to the Winter Olympics.

554
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,620
Sir.

555
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,250
How can you praise someone else's disciple?

556
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,660
Zhi.

557
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,330
Don't believe him.

558
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,050
You're a good skier

559
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,250
and very talented.

560
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,330
You could compete

561
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,530
in the Winter Olympics with more practice.

562
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,180
Winter Olympics

563
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,220
for toddlers in cotton coats?

564
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,570
What are you doing?

565
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,180
I have more.

566
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,490
Stop talking nonsense.

567
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,330
Stop talking nonsense.

568
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,860
Take that.

569
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,460
Come on.

570
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,290
I can't hold on.

571
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,940
No. I can do it myself.

572
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,490
OK.

573
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,900
Let's go.

574
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,770
Get some rest.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,660
Nice.

576
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,660
Very good.

577
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,700
I think you're

578
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,660
pretty stable right now,

579
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,490
so the next step is

580
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,980
to pick up speed slowly.

581
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,700
That way, I can teach you

582
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,660
the uphill traverse.

583
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,730
But is it unsafe

584
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,770
to go too fast?

585
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,420
What's wrong with going fast?

586
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,620
As long as your route

587
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,660
is accurate enough,

588
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,180
you can control the speed.

589
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,770
But Yan told me skiing

590
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,220
is about maintaining stability.

591
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,860
That's why he's so mediocre.

592
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,140
You're so talented,

593
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,620
so why don't you challenge yourself?

594
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,220
Besides,

595
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,380
what's the point

596
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,290
of extreme sports if you're

597
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,010
all about stability in this sport?

598
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,330
You're right,

599
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,900
but I'm a little afraid of high speeds.

600
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,330
That's not a problem.

601
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,180
With an expert like me, you won't fall.

602
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,980
Ski without fear.

603
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,140
I'll follow you from behind.

604
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,380
Then you just have to

605
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,330
watch your route.

606
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:48,860
Okay.

607
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,940
Come on.

608
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,140
Watch your route.

609
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,050
That's good.

610
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,530
That's good.

611
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,460
Watch your edge control.

612
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,810
Faster.

613
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,220
Faster.

614
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,490
Lower your center of gravity a little bit.

615
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,980
The faster, the more stable,

616
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,660
okay?

617
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,660
Slide with the edge.

618
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,180
Faster.

619
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,770
Faster.

620
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,570
Faster.

621
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,490
Faster.

622
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,330
Slide with the edge. Nice.

623
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,380
Is that right?

624
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,420
That's good.

625
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,460
Control your edge.

626
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,250
Jiang Nanfeng.

627
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,050
Jiang Nanfeng, be careful.

628
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm sorry.

629
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm not very good at it either.

630
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,380
Jiang Nanfeng.

631
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,650
Zhi, you've improved so much.

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,260
You didn't even wear your turtle today.

633
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,530
That's because you taught me well.

634
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,770
Wait a minute. I'll take a call.

635
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,140
Hello, Jiang...

636
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,970
It's me, Dai Duo.

637
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,250
Why you?

638
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,050
Jiang Nanfeng fell down.

639
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,690
What? She fell?

640
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,380
Who fell? My sister?

641
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,450
Where is she hurt?

642
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,290
She's fine.

643
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,690
Just a little sore

644
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,820
on the left side of her body.

645
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,900
And she seems

646
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,690
to have twisted her wrist.

647
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,940
It's nothing serious.

648
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,820
I took her back to the hotel.

649
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,450
OK.

650
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,490
We'll be right there.

651
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,050
I'll go there first.

652
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,580
Sir, take care of her.

653
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,530
I haven't said where she is.

654
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,970
She's not in the infirmary.

655
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,970
What to do? Let's go now.

656
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,050
Luckily, that's not serious.

657
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,210
Come on. I'll take you down.

658
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,690
Come on.

659
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:47,860
Sir.

660
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,580
Would you like some coffee?

661
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,380
Let me buy you a cup.

662
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,050
I'm fine.

663
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,940
You drink it. Thank you.

664
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,530
Okay.

665
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,900
[Senior]

666
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,540
[Senior, can you give me another chance to start over?]

667
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,250
Yan.

668
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,770
What's up?

669
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,690
Don't you need to give your senior

670
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,290
a lesson today?

671
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,210
She has another coach now.

672
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,660
They're probably skiing at this hour.

673
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,100
I just saw Dai Duo

674
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,580
carrying her back to the hotel.

675
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,580
I thought I wasn't sober then.

676
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,770
What?

677
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,380
Did you go down the mountain?

678
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,860
Let's come out and talk.

679
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,050
Where are you?

680
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,290
She can't answer the phone right now.

681
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,380
Dai Duo?

682
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,340
Why do you have

683
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,250
Jiang Nanfeng's cell phone?

684
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,970
Where is she?

685
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,690
She's lying down.

686
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,970
Say that again.

687
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,380
Wait a minute.

688
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,900
Why are you yelling in broad daylight?

689
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,420
Your master didn't...

690
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,340
Dai Duo, are you provoking me?

691
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,620
Why is he doing this?

692
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,490
Your master

693
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,140
didn't teach you to talk nicely,

694
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,860
did he?

695
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,530
Here.

696
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,450
Jiang Nanfeng, I'm coming.

697
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,420
Wait a minute. I'll go with you.

698
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,010
Now.

699
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,050
Hurry up. I'm in a hurry.

700
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,450
Hurry up.

701
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,660
I'm in a hurry.

702
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,580
Stupid kid.

703
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,860
It's a customized model. He'll lose it.

704
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,140
Nanfeng's business was more urgent for him.

705
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,970
Let's bring it back to him.

706
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,530
Let's go.

707
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,490
Yan, what are you doing?

708
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,730
What's going on?

709
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,290
Zhi, go away.

710
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,940
This has nothing to do with you.

711
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,860
Don't be noisy.

712
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,420
Wait a minute.

713
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,940
What's wrong with you?

714
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,940
Why did you kick his skis?

715
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,820
Get out of the way.

716
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,530
Yan.

717
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,010
Don't.

718
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,450
Have you embarrassed yourself enough?

719
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,770
So many people are watching you,

720
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,690
but aren't you ashamed?

721
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,820
What did I tell you?

722
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,820
Two famous people in this circle

723
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,100
are making a scene over a student.

724
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,530
If others find out, won't you be ashamed?

725
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,660
Chong, don't speak

726
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,620
for a fool like Dai Duo.

727
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,970
How did he beg you before?

728
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,820
But how is he treating you now?

729
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,580
Don't get involved.

730
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,180
Have you figured out your own business?

731
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,580
It's true

732
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,490
that it's Jiang Nanfeng's right to choose

733
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,290
who will be her coach,

734
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,450
but on her first day

735
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,210
she doesn't have to...

736
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,340
What's wrong with me slamming his skis?

737
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,180
If Dai Duo was here,

738
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,250
I'd slam him, too.

739
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,530
Yan.

740
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,820
Look at your master's hand.

741
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm fine.

742
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,770
No. The wound is so big.

743
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,860
Go get stitched up.

744
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,940
Let's finish Yan's business first.

745
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,900
Why that first?

746
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,970
You're hurt so badly.

747
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,660
Let's go.

748
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,660
Chong.

749
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:21,780
Master.

750
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,620
Where are the car keys?

751
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:30,850
Come on.

752
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,260
Get out of the way.

753
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,650
Let me do it.

754
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,860
What's so funny?

755
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,970
I didn't realize you're scary

756
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,210
when you lose your temper

757
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,380
even if you're usually playful.

758
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,140
Look at your frown.

759
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,540
So worried about me?

760
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,250
Even in this case,

761
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,140
you don't forget to joke.

762
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,970
You're hurt so badly.

763
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,300
What if you get a scar?

764
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,210
Yan.

765
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,010
He's

766
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,250
so reckless.

767
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,650
I'm furious.

768
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,580
Who is it?

769
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,730
Who is it?

770
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,690
What are you doing, Dai Duo?

771
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,490
Yan?

772
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:58,730
What the...

773
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,300
Why are you looking for trouble during the daytime?

774
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,780
Is this what Shan Chong taught you?

775
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,930
Stop.

776
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,250
Who are you to mention my Master?

777
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,300
Stop.

778
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,060
So what?

779
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,860
Stop it.

780
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,380
Stop being crazy.

781
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,210
Stop being crazy.

782
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:11,690
Stop it.

783
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,540
Stop it.

784
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,100
If you don't stop,

785
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,860
I'll call the police.

786
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,380
Hello, 110.

787
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,410
Doctor.

788
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,060
Is he badly hurt?

789
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,380
Will he get tetanus?

790
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,930
Will that hurt?

791
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,780
No.

792
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,100
I've already anesthetized him.

793
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,620
Don't worry.

794
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,690
Okay. I'll start on the wound now.

795
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,060
Wait a minute.

796
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,380
What's wrong?

797
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,060
Wait for me outside.

798
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,820
Don't look.

799
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,100
No, I'm fine.

800
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,100
I'll stay here with you.

801
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,580
I'll be fine.

802
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,250
Go out.

803
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,300
I'll wait for you outside.

804
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,860
I'll start now.

805
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,970
You're amazing.

806
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,300
The Helen of skiing.

807
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,010
I can't believe you started this war.

808
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,180
The Helen?

809
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,900
I think the real Helen

810
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,820
should be your master,

811
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,900
Shan Chong.

812
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,130
Explain.

813
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,930
Do you really think

814
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,490
they did that because of me?

815
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,860
What do you mean?

816
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,900
One is his frenemy,

817
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,450
the other is a disciple

818
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,780
who has followed him for years.

819
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,610
They were actually fighting over Shan Chong at my place.

820
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,930
They almost tore down my room.

821
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,820
Two idiots.

822
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,610
Who called the police?

823
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,410
I'm hanging up.

824
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,260
The police are here.

825
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,780
Shan Chong's family member.

826
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,180
Is Shan Chong's family member here?

827
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,900
Yes.

828
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,780
What's going on?

829
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,410
What's going on?

830
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,300
What's going on?

831
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,380
The doctor finished it quickly.

832
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,260
Get the medicine.

833
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,490
Did you hear me,

834
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,530
my family member?

835
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,740
Yes, Uncle.

836
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,380
Uncle?

837
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,930
Don't move.

838
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,930
Why are you fighting?

839
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,970
Sir.

840
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,090
Actually, it was just a little misunderstanding

841
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,090
between friends.

842
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,930
What's your name?

843
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,970
Have you been hurt

844
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,050
in love?

845
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,180
Are you taking revenge on society?

846
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,340
They even fought.

847
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,930
I didn't do anything today.

848
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,970
Why don't you go ask

849
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,260
your good friend, Yan,

850
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,860
if he's been hurt in love

851
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,450
that he's so stupid

852
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,820
but still enjoys it?

853
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,860
You're really right.

854
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,970
He told me that

855
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,820
when he was drunk.

856
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,340
He cried his eyes out

857
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,930
and threw up all over me.

858
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,130
Does it hurt?

859
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,860
The doctor told me not to let it get wet

860
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,290
to keep it dry.

861
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,020
I'm to blame for this.

862
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,380
I shouldn't have asked Dai Duo

863
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,650
to coach Jiang Nanfeng.

864
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,500
These things could have been avoided.

865
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,180
Don't think too much.

866
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,660
That's their own problem.

867
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,260
By the way,

868
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,180
Dai Duo

869
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,180
is on the national team, isn't he?

870
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,410
Why do we see him everywhere?

871
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,970
Him?

872
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,340
He's always been

873
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,450
so frivolous.

874
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,890
Hopefully, this won't affect his weighted ranking tournament.

875
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,140
You seem to care about him.

876
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,450
I care about

877
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,180
Chinese snowboarding.

878
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,450
I think you two

879
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,140
love and hate each other.

880
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,620
Master.

881
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,220
I have to tell you

882
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,140
something very important.

883
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,220
Jiang Nanfeng seems to have called the police.

884
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,260
Shan Chong.

885
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,490
Your medicine is ready, Shan Chong.

886
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:07,970
Let me go.

887
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,530
Jiang Nanfeng.

888
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,180
You...

889
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,780
I'm sorry, Chong.

890
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,300
Why are you apologizing to me?

891
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,300
Did you scold or hit me?

892
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,450
I'm sorry.

893
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,660
I said the wrong thing,

894
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,090
but I didn't mean it.

895
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,700
That's okay.

896
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,490
I'm okay

897
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,570
with that kind of thing.

898
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,860
Besides,

899
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,780
it's normal

900
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,930
for something to happen

901
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,820
between adults.

902
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,780
It's nothing.

903
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,090
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

904
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:58,970
Don't take it personally.

905
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,450
It's okay.

906
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,370
I don't take maniacs seriously.

907
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,260
Dai Duo.

908
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,930
Apologize.

909
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,010
Then I apologize, too.

910
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,260
I shouldn't have been stupid enough to say those things

911
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,370
or hit you on impulse.

912
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,410
I'm sorry.

913
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,780
Did you break your arm?

914
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,620
It won't kill me.

915
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,140
OK.

916
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,700
The most important thing

917
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,700
is to have fun when we're out,

918
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,660
especially when we're skiing.

919
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,300
A smile kills all hatred.

920
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,930
After this coach's

921
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,010
hand heals,

922
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,010
let's go out together.

923
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,140
How about this?

924
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,820
I hurt my hand these days,

925
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,490
and I can't ski,

926
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,620
so do you want to go to Lezhou early?

927
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,780
What do you think?

928
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,370
Nice.

929
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,010
Nice.

930
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,890
Let's go.

931
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,660
Let's go.

932
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,260
Me, too.

933
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,660
No.

934
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,450
I'll take pictures for you.

935
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,010
Okay.

936
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,450
Nanfeng, join us?

937
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,660
Do I have a choice?

938
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,570
I will.

939
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,890
Me, too.

940
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,450
Okay.

941
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,700
We'll go together.

942
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,530
We'll go together.

943
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,530
Okay.

944
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,090
This one is for your brother.

945
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,780
The spicy one is for Duo.

946
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,450
This is for your boss.

947
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,570
She's from the South

948
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,300
and likes mild food.

949
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,970
Ask her for her address later.

950
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,530
I'll courier it tomorrow.

951
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,370
All three of them

952
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,890
seem to be in Xicheng now.

953
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,050
Is your boss in Xicheng, too?

954
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,700
That's good.

955
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,300
We can send them together.

956
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,450
By the way, mom.

957
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,970
Should we

958
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,490
mail it to Dai Duo alone?

959
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,450
He and my brother

960
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,660
seem to be at loggerheads again.

961
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,410
They'll be at loggerheads

962
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,220
until they're 90,

963
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,820
but

964
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,740
can Duo

965
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,860
eat whatever

966
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,890
he likes there?

967
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,050
Athletes

968
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,620
have exclusive nutritionists.

969
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,530
Mom.

970
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,410
Never mind that.

971
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,340
What does it matter if he eats or not?

972
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,260
If he doesn't want to eat,

973
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,820
he can

974
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,570
give it to Mr. Wang.

975
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,450
You don't need to worry about him.

976
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,620
That makes sense.

977
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,220
[Heizi]

978
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,410
Wait a minute.

979
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,890
Mom. I'm going in to take a call.

980
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,620
Go ahead.

981
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,450
Go ahead.

982
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,410
What are you doing?

983
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,490
I'm in rehab.

984
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,140
Since my girlfriend is working so hard,

985
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,370
I have to do the same.

986
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,260
Wait for me.

987
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,490
No need.

988
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,970
It seems to me

989
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,370
that you want to quit the team, too.

990
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,860
Wait a minute.

991
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,180
Did your brother

992
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,410
talk nonsense?

993
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,010
What nonsense could he talk?

994
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,570
Such as you got into a fight with someone

995
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,780
after giving a female student a lesson?

996
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,700
Well.

997
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,530
Why is Shan Chong, a man,

998
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,570
so full of nonsense?

999
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:50,930
No.

1000
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,140
It was not like that.

1001
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,930
Don't believe his nonsense.

1002
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,620
It was really just a misunderstanding.

1003
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,570
My brother didn't make stories up,

1004
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,300
but I'm better

1005
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,180
at summarizing them.

1006
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,450
No, Shan.

1007
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,140
It was really a misunderstanding.

1008
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,490
OK.

1009
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,740
Now turn on the camera

1010
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,890
and let me see you, okay?

1011
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,890
No need.

1012
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,570
Seriously,

1013
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,490
if you don't want to get serious about skiing,

1014
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,570
you can be an instructor

1015
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,490
like my brother.

1016
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,140
No.

1017
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,530
I really didn't want to quit the team.

1018
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:15,970
How...

1019
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,700
How could I possibly do that?

1020
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,220
Then why don't you

1021
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,410
use your loaf more?

1022
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,370
Why do you have to

1023
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,890
be so impulsive every time?

1024
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,260
I swear, Shan,

1025
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,490
that it was really just a misunderstanding

1026
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,370
and that I definitely

1027
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,570
didn't start it.

1028
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,260
It was actually Yan

1029
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,740
who provoked me.

1030
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,300
Right?

1031
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,930
He provoked me,

1032
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,490
so we just...

1033
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,370
So...

1034
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:39,970
We...

1035
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,450
Right?

1036
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,010
You know it.

1037
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,740
And then

1038
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,930
he got hurt.

1039
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,970
And were you hurt?

1040
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,860
Of course not.

1041
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,780
Not in the slightest.

1042
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,890
My physique doesn't allow me

1043
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,820
to get hurt.

1044
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,890
Then I'll punish you

1045
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,860
with a hundred push-ups.

1046
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,370
Really?

1047
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,820
Mr. Wang just punished me.

1048
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,300
This is the punishment from your girlfriend.

1049
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,010
It's up to you.

1050
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,970
I request 99 push-ups.

[Snowy Classroom. Introduction to Snowboarding]

1052
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,780
Today, I'm going to give you

1053
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,260
a brief introduction to snowboarding.

1054
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,100
First, choose the length of your snowboard.

1055
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,050
When the snowboard is stood up,

1056
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,140
its highest point

1057
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,620
should be between your nose and chin.

1058
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,580
This side is the front of the snowboard.

1059
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,010
You can tell the head and tail

1060
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,660
by the pattern or words.

1061
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,300
This side is the bottom of the board,

1062
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,100
which is where it is used to touch the snow.

1063
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,300
The sides are the edges.

1064
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,220
You should try to wear gloves when holding it

1065
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,780
to prevent scratching your palms.

1066
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,220
Next are the bindings.

1067
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,490
The small bindings go where the toe is,

1068
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,850
and the big bindings go where the ankle is.

1069
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,890
OK.

1070
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,180
Once you've got your skis on, I'll move on

1071
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,490
to the heelside falling leaf.

1072
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,300
First, look in the direction you're skiing.

1073
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,050
Your head and shoulders should be aligned with the direction of the ski.

1074
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,300
As you go, lower your center of gravity

1075
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,700
and step your right foot forward.

1076
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,930
Be sure to hold this position.

1077
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,220
Next is the toe-edge sliding.

1078
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,660
Look straight ahead.

1079
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,410
Do not look down.

1080
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,050
Keep your arms relaxed and open

1081
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,970
for balance.

1082
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,050
Your shoulders, hips, and knees should be parallel to the snowboard.

1083
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,220
Lift your heels

1084
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,300
and bend your knees forward slightly.

1085
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,930
Note

1086
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,780
that you need to push on both feet at the same time

1087
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,780
to ski smoothly.

1088
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,530
You need to be aware that you should always

1089
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,220
choose a spacious slope while skiing.

1090
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,700
If you lose control

1091
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,180
and are about to hit the fence,

1092
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,220
I can teach you a little trick

1093
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,970
to protect yourself.

1094
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,740
First, turn your body in the opposite direction.

1095
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,300
Extend your right fist and left leg.

1096
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,890
Then, left fist and right leg.

1097
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,620
In this way, we can successfully dodge the protective net

1098
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,260
and avoid risks.
