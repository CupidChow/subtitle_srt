00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,850
Go ahead and tell her now

192
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,260
that someone as stupid as her

193
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,220
will never figure it out in her lifetime.

194
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,780
Finish it

195
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,370
before it embarrasses me

196
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,370
in the serialization section.

197
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,060
Okay, Mr. Wang.

198
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,010
Take it easy.

199
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
I'll pass on

200
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,220
what you said to her.

201
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,180
Bunch of losers.

202
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,580
[Ski into Love]

203
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,630
[Ski into Love]

204
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,770
This style

205
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,060
seems familiar.

206
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,300
Hello?

207
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,970
Zhai, are you in the studio?

208
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,460
Open the door.

209
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,820
Coming.

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,250
An arrow through the clouds.

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,220
Thousands of troops have come to meet.

212
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,220
From today,

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,130
we'll be stationed here

214
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,010
with you.

215
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,540
Don't mind us taking up your space.

216
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,820
How can I?

217
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,060
Meizi.

218
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,890
What about Xuan?

219
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,620
Don't worry.

220
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,640
My mom will take care of him.

221
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,970
Thank you.

222
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,730
We're with you.

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,130
It's already one o'clock.

224
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,850
Why don't you go to sleep?

225
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,970
I can't.

226
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,010
Miss Zhai is too busy.

227
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,580
She paints from morning till night.

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,940
You know what?

229
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,900
She does

230
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,650
a month's work in a week.

231
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,370
She hasn't been this productive before, has she?

232
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,580
No,

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,220
but she updated her story

234
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,250
about being on the wrong account,

235
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,850
and it became a trending topic.

236
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,130
That's not something

237
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,100
to be ashamed of,

238
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,460
but some internet users

239
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,460
seem to take special delight

240
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,130
in that sort of thing

241
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,850
and make a show of themselves.

242
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,460
Both of her accounts

243
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,370
are hot right now.

244
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,700
Ski into Love has

245
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,010
over 10,000 subscribers.

246
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,100
Even if it's over a million,

247
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,940
you still have to sleep.

248
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,970
But what can I do?

249
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,220
It's just taking off,

250
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,420
so I definitely can't

251
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,580
hold Miss Zhai back.

252
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,650
I'm worried

253
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,770
about her status, though,

254
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,460
because she seems

255
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,610
to be turning her grief

256
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,490
into motivation right now.

257
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,580
I don't know

258
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,970
who's making Zhi

259
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,610
so sad and upset.

260
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,570
Did you go to class

261
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,860
after you went out the day?

262
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,820
Do you want to wake up Mom and Dad?

263
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,850
But you've been going out early, coming home late,

264
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,900
and disappearing every day

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,010
since you got back from Nancheng.

266
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,940
Did you sneak off

267
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,770
to train?

268
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,340
Eat your fruit.

269
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,940
[Wei Zhi]

270
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,540
So

271
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,250
let's take some time apart.

272
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,890
Okay?

273
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,250
It's in the comic anyway.

274
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,820
I can't be merciful enough to just let him die once.

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,540
It's not enough for him to die a hundred times.

276
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,730
He should die a thousand or ten thousand times.

277
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,180
Who?

278
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,940
An isekai villain?

279
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,180
Nothing.

280
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,130
OK.

281
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,580
Mr. Zhang Yu.

282
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:16,970
Manman.

283
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,700
I was about to see you.

284
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,420
Come, sit down.

285
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,730
I'm afraid

286
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,060
we can't delay the Farewell Song any longer.

287
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,540
This work

288
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,340
is very important

289
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,540
to you and me.

290
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,010
Of course,

291
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,650
I understand your caution,

292
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,940
but right now, the statistics

293
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,610
and reader feedback

294
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,730
are not good,

295
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,300
so if we don't finish it,

296
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,250
your job

297
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,700
and mine,

298
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,460
Zhai's reputation,

299
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,300
and Farewell Song's intellectual property rights

300
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,730
might...

301
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,970
But Mr. Zhang Yu,

302
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,700
I haven't figured out

303
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,610
how to make the heroine become what she was before.

304
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,460
Do you think

305
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,420
you'll have any new ideas

306
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,130
for the ending

307
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,650
if I

308
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,520
get you another extension

309
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,730
on the serialization?

310
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,770
Manman.

311
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,610
You're already

312
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,890
a very experienced artist.

313
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,460
Based on the way things are going,

314
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,220
it doesn't matter if the ending will be underwhelming or not.

315
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,100
It's imperative

316
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,850
that we finish it soon

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,610
so we can work

318
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,940
on your Absolute 0 together.

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,840
But it's true

320
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,020
that I'm not very good at sports.

321
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,180
I started out wanting

322
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,460
to draw an inspirational comic,

323
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,940
but I don't seem to have mastered

324
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,220
the first few chapters.

325
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,850
It's not about the first few chapters.

326
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,850
Let me put it this way.

327
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,620
Manman, you are good at stability,

328
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,970
but sometimes

329
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,010
a good literary

330
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,100
or artistic work

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,850
requires you

332
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,460
to make some breakthroughs and have some spirituality.

333
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,940
Mr. Zhang Yu.

334
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,820
Actually, I've been asking myself

335
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,890
every day for the past few days

336
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,220
if I can do it.

337
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,580
Based on your many years

338
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,970
of experience,

339
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,970
do you think I am really suitable

340
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,010
to be a lead artist?

341
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,610
Just keep painting,

342
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,730
and you'll get better

343
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,700
and better.

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,820
Go ahead

345
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,460
and revise.

346
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,370
Try your best.

347
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,180
Thank you, Mr. Zhang Yu.

348
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,860
[Half a Farewell Song]

349
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,650
You've done an amazing job on this hairpin.

350
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,450
The heroine's beauty

351
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,060
instantly increases by 20%.

352
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,100
Right?

353
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,930
It's really pretty.

354
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,300
Manman.

355
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,260
You're great.

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,500
You managed to get the texture so great

357
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,340
in your first hair detailing.

358
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,540
You'll be a master in the future.

359
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,610
- You're too kind. - Manman.

360
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,540
Miss Manman, that's great.

361
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,450
Give me your autograph.

362
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,580
OK.

363
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,410
I want one too.

364
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,020
Hey, guys.

365
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,130
Do you guys think

366
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,690
we could use this

367
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,300
as our main poster

368
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,850
at the book signing?

369
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,300
- Yeah. - Yes. No problem.

370
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,690
Before,

371
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,340
I was worried about our studio,

372
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,890
but I was wrong.

373
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,880
Now that we're

374
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,820
all so amazing,

375
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,740
I have more confidence

376
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,930
in our studio.

377
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,890
Of course.

378
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,300
We'll beat everyone.

379
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,690
Let's go.

380
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,780
I should have killed her a long time ago.

381
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,020
Why look at me?

382
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,260

462
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,740
I remember when we were working

463
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,860
on the Farewell Song,

464
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,300

00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,260
Gosh.

00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,210
I suddenly feel like we're so old.

467
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,740
Not "we".

468
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,450
I wonder what Farewell Song

469
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,340
looks like now.

470
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,130
Meizi, have a strawberry.

471
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,340
I'm not that fragile.

472

Besides,

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,670
Mr. Zhang Yu.

576
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,850
Try harder.

577
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,170
Work harder.

578
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,540
You can do it.

579
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,060
Mr. Wang, you'd better stop holding it in.

580
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,100
It's bad for your health.

581
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,210
Hold in what?

582
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,060
What's wrong with me?

583
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,020
Wei Zhi is still number one.

584
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,690
Wei Zhi?

585
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,130
I knew it.

586
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,650
Mr. Zhang Yu.

587
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,130
Let's be generous.

588
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,450
Look,

589
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,690
isn't Wei Zhi

590
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,410
from Tiger Comics?

591
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,850
She has such a good career now.

592
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,650
What does that mean?

593
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,100
It means Tiger Comics

594
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,450
is an excellent platform.

595
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,370
Look.

596
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,410
She's way ahead

597
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,740
in votes now.

598
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,410
How can we be jealous of her?

599
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,650
Of course, we should

600
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,020
respect her

601
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,500
and wish her well,

602
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,170
hoping that she

603
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,740
will climb to the top

604
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,610
and get more votes

605
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,450
to win.

606
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,340
That's good, isn't it?

607
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,540
Yes.

608
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,500
Go to work.

609
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,780
Don't think so much.

610

congratulate her

614
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,370
for me.

615
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,890
I haven't had much contact

616
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,210
with her lately.

617
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,060
So

618
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,650
if there's nothing else, Mr. Wang, I...

619
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,580
Go ahead.

It's...

It's not right.

626
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,890
Get away from it.

627
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,020
It's almost in your face.

No, it's not.

629

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,300
So awesome?

632
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,300
Awesome?

633
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,820
That's an outrageous number.

How can that be?

It's already impressive

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,210
for an international comic

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,450

654
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,060
How dare you manipulate votes in a contest?

655
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,780
Why don't you contact

656
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,410
the organizers

657
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,650
and spend money to bribe them?

658
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,980
Okay, I got it.

659
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,770
Hello?

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,440
Please believe us.

661
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,730
We definitely did not rig the vote.

662
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,800
If we were caught doing that,

663
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,280
we'd be disqualified.

664
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,370
How dare we?

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,650
Okay, then.

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,820
OK.

We'll wait to hear from you.

668
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,740
What did they say?

669
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,540
The organizing committee said after they investigated the IPR

670
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,180
and got rid of those votes from fake accounts

671
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,090
and paid posters,

672
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,820
we had about 120,000 votes.

Now that they have been removed,

674
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,690
what to do now?

675
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,690
Now...

676
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,370
I don't know.

677
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,930
They're saying we need to wait

678
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,100
because the public opinion is so bad

679
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,450
and there are so many negative comments.

680
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,410

you're still following it?

702
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,020
The final chapter of Farewell Song is out.

703

712
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,130
I read the final chapter of Farewell Song.

713
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,930
So?

714
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,020

715
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,060
Of course not.

716
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,170
I read the comments section,

717
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,690
and I'm sure you did too.

718
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,850
As a professional creator,

719
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,260
did you really allow Farewell Song

720
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,100
to be so rushed at the end?

721
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,410
You are no longer the author of Farewell Song,

722
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,210
so who are you

723
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,210
to tell me what to do?

724
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,770
Honestly,

725
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,500
I read Absolute 0 too.

726
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,730
That's not your level of creativity either.

727
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,860
Manman.

728
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,170
Have you encountered

729
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,810
any difficulties or bottlenecks

730
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,810
in your creative endeavors lately?

731
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,980
Did Wang Laohu also tell you

732
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,090
that your content

733
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,370
won't be accepted by the market

734
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,420
and won't bear fruit?

735
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,460
Does he care

736
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,560
about profit and traffic

737
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,060
rather than what you create?

738
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,650
I know what you're trying

739
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,410
to say.

740
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,650
But if we don't monetize our work,

741
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,130
then I'll lose my job,

742
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,500
and no one will believe in me anymore.

743
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,210
That's not going to happen.

744
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,290
That's

745
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,900
what Wang Laohu told me

746
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,900
in the beginning.

747
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,380
But then I realized that

748
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,500
as long as I stay true

749
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,650
to what I'm creating,

750
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,250
the content I'm creating

751
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,610
is something readers can relate to.

752
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,380
And, think about it.

753
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,580
In the beginning,

754
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,900
we didn't have many likes

755
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,130
or comments, did we?

756
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,250
But through our later efforts,

757
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,170
we were recognized

758
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,770
by the public step by step.

759
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,060

760
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,460
I really like Farewell Song.

761
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,690
Working with you guys

762
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,420
to make Farewell Song become a hit step by step

763
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,690
is really the happiest thing

764
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,860
in my life.

765
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,860
But you know after the AI drawing

766
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,580
was exposed,

767
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,460
I really felt like

768
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,860
my whole life was going to fall apart.

769
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,900
Of course,

770
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,770
I know that person is definitely not you.

771
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,900
But I just can't understand

772
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,420
why every time I asked you about it,

773
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,490
you had to harbor him

774
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,500
and wouldn't tell us

775
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,850
the truth.

776
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,860
I'm an author.

777
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,860
Whoever utilized the AI

778
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,460
was my responsibility.

779
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,420
You're being silly.

780
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,170
You could easily

781
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,330
kill your career.

782
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,730
I wasn't thinking that much.

783
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,860
I'm just doing

784
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,540
what I think is right.

785
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,460
I've always

786
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,380
envied you,

787
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,730
your certainty,

788
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,020
and your tolerance for mistakes.

789
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,420
I can't do that.

790
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,380
I'm always looking over my shoulder

791
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,580
and at a loss.

792
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,100
So Wei Zhi,

793
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,130
you must thank your family

794
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:26,940
for giving you

795
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,980
such confidence and courage.

796
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,770
I know.

797
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:40,900
Manman.

798
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,540
Since when did you

799
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
start talking so maturely?

800
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,900
Maybe that's the trial

801
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,290
of the society.

802
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,380
I want to have such confidence

803
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,810
and courage too,

804
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,130
but I don't dare.

805
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,650
I read the contract.

806
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm going to lose a lot of money if I terminate it.

807
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,460
Speaking of contracts,

808
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,980
did you notice

809
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,460
anything wrong?

810
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,730
According to you,

811
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,650
what I signed at the time was indeed

812
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,290
a mediocre contract,

813
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,650
but later when I was reading it,

814
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,170
I realized that there were a lot of non-compete clauses,

815
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,250
such as the adaption right,

816
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,210
the right to make it into a movie,

817
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,860
or all other rights related

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,610
to the comic

819
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,020
had been ceded to Wang Laohu.

820
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,770
Gosh.

821
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,020
Wang Laohu is so greedy.

822
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,580
Why didn't you consult him?

823
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,900
I didn't dare.

824
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,770
I was afraid he'd shut me down

825
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,980
if I told him.

826
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,250
Then I wouldn't be able

827
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,460
to survive in this field.

828
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,490
That's the way it is.

829
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,220
Mr. Li.

830
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,980
We need to ask you

831
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,220
to organize the pleadings for us.

832
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,330
No problem.

833
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,980
His infringement

834
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,690
is obvious.

835
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,540
As long as you have sufficient evidence,

836
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,460
we'll have a good chance

837
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,210
of winning the case.

838

If we have no choice

839
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,420
but to go that far,

840
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,940
we need to trouble you even more.

841
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,540
By the way, Mr. Li.

842
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,470
Tomorrow,

843
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,130
I'd like to make an appointment to talk to him.

844
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,690
Is it convenient for you to go with me?

845
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,210
Of course.

851

853
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,250
Yes, I do.

854
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,610
I'm calling you

855
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,420
because Yan said you're in the entertainment business too.

856
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,100
I saw the number of votes

857
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,060
Wei Zhi got.

858
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,250
I consulted lawyers.

859
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,770
They said their votes

860
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,250
were maliciously manipulated.

861
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,940
I recently asked a friend of mine

862
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,730
to look into a few companies

863
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,980
that hire people to manipulate votes.

864
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,690
Give this list to Wei Zhi.

865
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,170
After comparing them, she should be able

866
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,170
to figure out the connection.

867
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,610
Okay.

Shall I show it to you?

956
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,380
That's right.

957
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm the one who rigged the vote.

958
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,540
So what?

959
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,610
What can you do to me?

960
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,130
I can't do anything to you.

961
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,980
I just want you to give me back

962
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,130
what's mine.

963
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,730
You have massively rigged the vote

964
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,250
in the official game,

965
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,460
and public opinion

966
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,380
is now getting very bad.

967
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,170
You can ask your legal staff.

968
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,580
If you lose the case,

969
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,060
can you afford the consequences?

970
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,810
Don't get in my face.

971
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,610
Do you think threatening me will work?

972
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,130
Mr. Li.

973
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,690
Based on what Mr. Wang did,

974
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,500
if he becomes a defendant,

975
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,540
can Tiger Comics

976
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,100
still go public?

977
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,130
Wei Zhi.

978
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,650
What do you want?

979
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,690
I don't want anything.

980
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,690
I just want

981
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,690
what's mine.

982
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,380
What if I don't give it to you?

983
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:01,900
If you don't,

984
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,690
I'll see you in court.

985
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,580
What a daydream.

986
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,290
Don't worry.

987
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,940
We have a good chance of winning the case.

988
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,210
I'll go back

989
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,210
and reorganize

990
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,210
all the information.

991
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,330
I'll contact you later.

Good luck.

He'll be choked to death when eating,

1004

fall to his death while walking,

1005

and be eaten by a bear while climbing a mountain.

1006
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,020
