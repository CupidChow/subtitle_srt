[Ski into Love]

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,980
[Adapted from Jinjiang Literature City's novel "Ski into Love" by Qing Mei]

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 2]

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,130
Turn around, back to me.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,740
Isn't it a little early to be bowing for red envelopes?

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,690
What are you doing?

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,570
What are you doing?

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,410
That's what I'm going to ask you.

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,260
Your dominant leg

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,380
is the one that feels more natural

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,130
and flexible.

37
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,490
It's also the one you lean on first

38
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,260
when starting to ski.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,460
If someone pushes you from behind,

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,460
the leg

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,690
you step out with without thinking

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,850
is your dominant leg.

43
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,690
The way to check might not be perfect.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,940
But it's what everyone does.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,980
So, professional coach,

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,100
did you see it clearly?

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,130
Which one of my legs

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,340
is the dominant leg?

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,450
Both of your legs

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,570
knelt down at the same time.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,010
Really smooth.

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,820
Are you kidding me?

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,010
Turn around?

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,570
I feel that!

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,540
My right leg is the dominant leg.

56
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,730
Coach.

57
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,100
My right leg is the dominant leg.

58
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,100
I'm not blind.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,130
I'll say this only once.

60
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,890
Listen carefully.

61
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,690
Open the binding backplate.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,170
Put on the dominant foot first.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,940
Press tightly against the binding backplate.

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,540
Secure the large strap first,

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,100
then the small strap.

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,010
Do it yourself now.

67
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,010
Step on.

68
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,570
Press tightly against the binding backplate.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,890
Coach,

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,060
am I doing it right?

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,410
The small strap goes over the toe.

72
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,220
Give me your hands.

73
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,100
Now, let's learn

74
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,890
about the heel edge sideslip.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,730
Heel edge? [*sounds like EX's antonym]

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,380
I know "ex-".

77
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,290
EX.

78
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,500
Stand on the board.

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,380
The side near your toes is the toeside.

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,850
The side near your heels is the heelside.

81
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,850
Just like you are now,

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,890
facing downhill,

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,130
sliding with the heel edge to control speed.

84
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,100
This is a heel edge sideslip.

85
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,380
Why are there

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,570
so many terms?

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,780
I can't understand them.

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,690
You still won't get it

89
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,540
no matter how many times I explained.

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,410
Come on,

91
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,410
you'll get it later.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,260
Come on.

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,980
Keep your upper body upright.

94
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,170
Head up.

95
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,410
Stay upright, don't stick your butt out.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm moving now.

97
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,890
Engage your toes.

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,780
Move slowly.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,570
Don't look down,

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,340
look at me.

101
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,450
Stay steady.

102
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,660
Slow down a bit.

103
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,780
Very good.

104
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,850
Okay, no rush.

105
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,130
Look at me.

106
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,900
Make way.

107
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,100
Apply even pressure with both feet.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,100
Lift your toes, and engage your heel edge.

109
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,170
Keep your eyes steady.

110
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,570
I need to check for bombers.

111
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,170
Look at me.

112
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,220
Look at me.

113
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,140
Relax your shoulders.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,010
Stop trying to use my goggles

115
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,620
as a mirror.

116
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,890
I'm moving.

117
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm moving.

118
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,060
I am moving!

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,490
For someone from Nancheng

120
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,540
who barely gets to touch snow,

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,780
you're learning pretty fast.

122
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,810
Did I ever tell you

123
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm from Nancheng?

124
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,700
I saw your photos

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,170
on your Moments.

126
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,660
Checking out female students' Moments

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,930
is part of your job, too?

128
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,140
I'm also from Nancheng.

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,580
Really?

130
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,610
Are you

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,020
from the University of Nancheng?

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,100
Yeah.

133
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,780
I'm your senior then.

134
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,290
But

135
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,540
I don't think I ever

136
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,850
saw you on campus.

137
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,540
To think that I didn't see you,

138
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,490
such a good-looking guy,

139
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,100
that's my loss.

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,250
Call me "Senior".

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,410
Senior.

142
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,290
Good boy.

143
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,460
Are you ready?

144
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,170
Let's go.

145
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,100
Does it hurt?

146
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,900
It's okay.

147
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,580
Remember the safety moves I taught you.

148
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,810
Don't take such hard falls.

149
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,460
Again.

150
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,540
Keep your upper body upright, lean forward...

151
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,170
Relax your shoulders.

152
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,980
Yes, right.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,980
Use both feet.

154
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,660
Yes.

155
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,490
Focus your eyes ahead.

156
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,780
Don't stand so stiff.

157
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,100
Where should I look?

158
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,020
Keep your eyes steady.

159
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,980
I do.

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,780
You're behind me.

161
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,810
How do you know where I'm looking at?

162
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,370
Don't look at the ground.

163
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,100
Stay upright.

164
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,610
Don't stick your butt out.

165
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,220
Don't lift your feet.

166
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,220
It hurts.

167
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,250
I need to find a way to stall for time.

168
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,290
I told you not to look at the ground.

169
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,170
Is there gold on the ground?

170
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,850
My mom is calling me.

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,980
Give me five minutes.

172
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,780
It will be quick.

173
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,980
Where are you?

174
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,980
I didn't see you on the Bunny Slope.

175
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,980
The sports major guy said

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,290
the Bunny Slope was too crowded,

177
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,020
so he brought me to the intermediate run.

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,780
The sports major guy?

179
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,340
My coach.

180
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,370
He's super handsome.

181
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,980
Jiang Nanfeng, you are truly sinful.

182
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,700
How are you doing?

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,930
I'm just trying not to die out here,

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,220
figuring out how to survive

185
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,850
the next 30 minutes.

186
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,810
Stop slacking off.

187
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,730
If you put your ski pass in that pocket,

188
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,610
it'll be easy to lose.

189
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,220
You'll never find it as it falls into the snow.

190
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,900
Put it inside the pocket

191
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,780
of your glove.

192
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,850
It's made for ski passes.

193
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,170
Got it?

194
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,580
Get used to wearing gloves

195
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,340
for everything,

196
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,660
including putting on and taking off your board.

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,850
Come on.

198
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,900
Take off your board.

199
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,020
Let's go

200
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,660
to the conveyor belt.

201
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,370
One more round.

202
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,730
Again?

203
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:15,980
Coach,

204
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,250
my friend

205
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,370
seems to be struggling.

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,540
How's her coach?

207
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,140
No way.

208
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,340
Chong is impressive.

209
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,340
He taught me, too.

210
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,900
So, what's next?

211
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,050
Next,

212
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,410
side slipping, all the way down.

213
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,980
Hey,

214
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,580
you never saw me

215
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,610
on campus?

216
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,250
Had enough falls?

217
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,850
The lesson is over.

218
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,650
Time's up.

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,650
Finally!

220
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,420
The lesson is over!

221
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,060
Thank you!

222
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,130
I'm off to return the equipment.

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,890
Bye.

224
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,370
Hey, Chong.

225
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,530
Go to the park tomorrow.

226
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,180
Are you in?

227
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,580
No.

228
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,700
How could you

229
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,610
choose tomorrow?

230
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,340
What? It's not

231
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,300
an auspicious day?

232
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,820
No...

233
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,100
I

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,530
agreed to teach a student tomorrow.

235
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,730
Didn't you beg me

236
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,010
to take you to the park?

237
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,980
Yeah.

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,700
Of course, I don't want to miss it.

239
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,940
But

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,610
why do you choose tomorrow?

241
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,770
Yesterday, the day before that,

242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,820
even two days before yesterday.

243
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,490
You didn't go.

244
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,060
When I have to

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,300
give lessons,

246
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,100
you're going there.

247
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,580
What?

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,980
You...

249
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,420
Who will you

250
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,220
teach then?

251
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,610
It's the one you introduced.

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,490
The girl on this afternoon?

253
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,460
What? You know her?

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,460
No.

255
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,890
How did she make the appointment?

256
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,610
Via WeChat.

257
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,460
WeChat?

258
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,100
What?

259
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,650
You love teaching beginners?

260
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,650
No.

261
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,460
After she finished my lesson,

262
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,890
she thought I was

263
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,820
very careful, gentle, and considerate

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,420
during the lesson.

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,650
Because of this lesson,

266
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,980
she started to be

267
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,370
interested in snowboarding.

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,940
She asked me to teach her.

269
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,820
I have no other choice.

270
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,980
What did she learn?

271
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,340
She learned pretty fast.

272
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,300
Heel edge sideslip,

273
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,460
and falling leaf.

274
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,060
She tried step turns as well.

275
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,610
Perhaps she will do an edge-switching tomorrow.

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,460
Break a butterfly on a wheel.

277
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,460
What?

278
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,100
I said I looked down on you.

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,700
Wait.

280
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,460
Chong.

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,700
Why is he mad?

282
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,820
Newbies these days are so bad.

283
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,100
Can't teach them at all.

284
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,180
Don't you know your temper?

285
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,700
Who in the group hasn't suffered because of you?

286
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,850
Don't you know your temper?

287
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,980
Who in the group hasn't suffered because of you?

288
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,460
Quit because of your temper, classic ending.

289
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,490
Quit because of your temper, classic ending.

290
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,250
Go to the park tomorrow.

291
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,060
Who's in?

292
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,980
- 1 - 1

293
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,910
- 1 - 1

294
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,390
1

295
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,820
For those who suffered because of me,

296
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,340
you don't have to come.

297
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,490
I'm so sorry.

298
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,820
I caught a cold a few days ago.

299
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,060
Here.

300
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,890
Wear a mask.

301
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,300
I don't want to infect you.

302
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,890
Thanks.

303
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,730
This is our brand's

304
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,890
sponsorship agreement for next year.

305
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,940
Take a look.

306
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,130
If there is no problem,

307
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,100
just sign here.

308
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,220
Okay.

309
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,340
[Brand Sponsorship Agreement]

310
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,060
Next year's equipment

311
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,130
will still be the best.

312
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:16,980
Okay.

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,180
Without contact lenses,

314
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,530
I can't see anything clearly now.

315
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,820
Be careful.

316
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,890
Thank

317
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,340
you...

318
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,370
What's this?

319
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,250
You kept looking at it.

320
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:54,980
Stop.

321
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,890
This was given by Pro.

322
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,820
A blessed glasses cloth.

323
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,250
Blessed?

324
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,460
What?

325
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,650
You can hang it

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,730
to avoid bad luck?

327
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,730
Wei Zhi,

328
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,650
if your mom knows

329
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,610
that you become insane

330
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,250
because of our journey,

331
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,220
will she sue me?

332
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,250
She will.

333
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,100
Open the door.

334
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,610
My lawyer

335
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,700
is right at the front door.

336
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,650
I feel so scared.

337
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,700
Jiang Nanfeng,

338
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,580
do you know what a Pro is?

339
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:17,940
Pro?

340
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,490
You mean your coach?

341
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,890
Come on!

342
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,180
Don't listen to your coach's

343
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,130
nonsense.

344
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,770
He's trying to save face

345
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,650
for his friend.

346
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,610
The Pro I meant

347
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,010
is a real professional one.

348
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,420
The last time I saw him

349
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,180
was on a screen this big.

350
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,610
Big screen?

351
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,940
You mean the Muse you saw

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,130
at the Anime Carnival?

353
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,730
Right.

354
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,370
I think he's truly worthy

355
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,980
of having the national flag

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,700
embroidered here.

357
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,580
That's pretty amazing then.

358
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,300
Why did he

359
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,460
give you a cloth then?

360
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,180
I told you!

361
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,530
It's a glasses cloth.

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,730
Glasses cloth!

363
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,820
Okay...

364
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,100
Now, I have limited

365
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,130
national team

366
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,850
merchandise.

367
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,370
Why did he

368
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,180
give you a glasses cloth?

369
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,250
Probably because

370
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,220
I'm beautiful.

371
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,460
Are you okay?

372
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,180
Even though it gets dark early here,

373
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,890
that doesn't mean

374
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,100
you can start sleep-talking.

375
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,940
However,

376
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,180
what a small world!

377
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,850
With so many ski resorts in the world,

378
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,420
he happened to come here.

379
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,300
I think he even smiled at me.

380
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,010
Now, I'm kind of grateful

381
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,490
to that

382
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,770
impulsive version of myself.

383
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,700
Are you still learning snowboarding?

384
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,940
Sure!

385
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,180
With Mr. Glasses Cloth here,

386
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,460
I have even more motivation.

387
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,850
So, by now, you must

388
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,010
have known his name, right?

389
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,060
I took off my contacts.

390
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,650
I didn't even see his face clearly.

391
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,530

394
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,700
I'll go date for you, okay?

395
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,890
I'll go date for you!

396
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,100
It's hard.

397
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,460
My cuteness is irreplaceable.

398
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,300

404
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,300
there's one person.

405
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,370
I only saw him once and I remembered him.

406
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,010

407
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,940

408
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,010

and ideally,

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,420
get to know him.

412
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,340

he

414
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,220
seems like the embodiment

Are you coming today?

It's raining today.

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,180

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,220
book a lesson with Chong

479
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,010

480
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,860

489

Why are you back?

Because I'm eager to learn.

510
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,180
I thought you weren't available.

511
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,660
She didn't recognize me.

512
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,770
Still?

513
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,700
Is she pretending?

514
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,290
What are you doing?

515
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,140
I'm available today.

516
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,250
I'll teach you.

517
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,810
Chong, aren't you going to the park today?

518
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,050
It's raining. I'm going.

519
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,420
Your student's board.

Do all the students get this treatment?

524
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,050
Next time, I'll bring breakfast for four people.

525
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,530
But it's raining outside,

526
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,490
can we still ski?

527
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,290
Rain at the base, snow at the top.

528
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,180

529
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,330
such good conditions.

532
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,010
Coach, I'd like to...

533
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,660
You don't deserve it.

534
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,570
Though you look good,

535
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
you are so mean!

536
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,490
So high.

537
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,700
Coach,

538
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,620
it's sunny now.

539
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,660
Coach,

540
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,770
no offense,

541
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,090
but why do I feel like you're

542
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,900
in a bad mood today?

543
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,570
What do you think?

544
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,290
If I were teaching

545
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,010
anyone else today,

546
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,940
they'd be on the advanced C slope.

547
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,220
What's wrong with A slope?

548
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,180
Today I'm definitely going to learn

549
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,250
the heelside falling leaf

550
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,220
to show you!

551
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,700
I wonder if my girl

552
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,620
can learn

553
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,090
the heelside falling leaf.

554
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,330
You have a girl? You are married?

555
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,050
I mean Wei Zhi.

556
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,620
She?

557
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,290
Yeah.

558
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,250
I think she can't.

559
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,010
I doubt it.

560
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,730
After all, she has

561
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,050
blessed merchandise given by Pro.

562
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,570
What Pro? What merchandise?

563
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,860
Last night,

564
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,010
a professional skier,

565
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,290
probably from the national team,

566
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,860
gave Wei Zhi a glasses cloth

567
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,530
to wipe her face.

568
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,770
She carried it as if it were

569
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,700
a treasure.

570
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,700
Though this ski resort is big,

571
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,050
famous skiers usually

572
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,900
don't come here.

573
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,900
They all go to the park down the mountain.

574
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,050
If you are talking about

575
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,980

576
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,860
whether retired

577
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,460
or active,

578
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,090
they all go

579
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,050
to the big slope area.

580
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,250
But in this resort,

a skiing legend,

583
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,220
it can only be Chong.

584
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,980
But the person

585
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,090
who gave her the glasses cloth

586
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,730
is indeed

587
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,700
a national team skier.

588
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,250
Wei Zhi watched his video.

589
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,860
So, your friend has been

590
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,730
on the national team?

591
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,290
Not only that...

It doesn't matter.

Change a topic.

594
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,490
No wonder Chong changed

595
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,980
his glasses cloth this morning.

596
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,460
So, he gave the old one

597
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,530
to your friend.

598
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,860
Your friend didn't

599
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,770
recognize Chong?

600
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,010
Should we tell her?

601
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,900
No,

602
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,980

their life is in the coach's hands.

608
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,140

Keeping a good mood

613
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,250
and staying happy?

Any hints?

625
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,220

630
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,900
There's not much appeal.

Stop drawing that.

It's themed around winter sports.

Mr. Wang,

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,810

Why did you bring me here?

733
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,140
An hour?

734
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,460
Couldn't stand after an hour of lesson?

it's easy to teach.

743
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,700
But teaching someone like you

744
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,490
is more rewarding.

745
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,460
How sweet.

746
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,660
Fine,

Let me teach you the toeside falling leaf.

749
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,290
Keep your board straight.

750
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,730
See that?

758
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,490
without clinging to me

759
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,810
and can ski on your own,

760
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,330
that means you can do it.

761
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,530
Who clung to you?

762
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,810
If you want to do heelside falling leaf,

763
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,490
first of all,

764
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,490
you need to understand

765
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,570
the concept of the central axis.

766
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,700

767
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,180
and go up to your navel.

768
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,180
Just talk,

769
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,460
don't touch me.

770
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,940
I wonder who yelled,

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,380
"Don't let go".

772
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,420
We are different.

773
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,900

777
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,420
The sunlight is too strong.

778
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,490
Look at the mountain.

Knees slightly bent.

780
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,290
Lift your heels and engage your toe edge.

781
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,660
Press your shin against the tongue of the boot.

782
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,570
Feel the support

783
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,620
from the shoe tongue.

784
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,180
I can't feel it.

785
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,980
The boots are old.

786
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,140
So, the fit and support

787
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,940
aren't so good.

I mean it.

Have a rest.

810
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,330
Get up, don't lie down here.

What are you doing?

816
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,810
Eliminate potential safety hazards in the ski resort.

817
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,660
My fault.

818
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,330
Let me walk myself.

819
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,140

skiing is actually very interesting.

After my exploration these past few days,

829
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,940
I feel skiing is a sport

830
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,690
full of philosophical meaning.

831
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,210
The process and experience of conquering the snow

832
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,170
is sometimes very similar to life,

833
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,780

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,490
Coach,

837
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,570
why don't you say anything?

838
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,010
I thought you were hibernating.

839
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,050
You said you're a comic artist.

840
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,380
Is drawing comics interesting?

841
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,650
Of course, it's interesting,

842
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,010
and I'm really good at it.

00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,300

I'm quite famous in the comic...

847
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,300
Forget it.

848
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,130

your comic skills

859
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,090
are definitely better

860
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,050
than your skiing skills.

861
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,610
Coach,

862
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,340
don't underestimate me.

863
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,130

Coach, you know what,

870
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,260
the reason I came to learn skiing

871
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,570
is actually to research

872
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,170
for my new work.

873
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,210
I need to understand

874
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,490
all about skiing

875
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,610

You want to draw a comic about skiing?

880
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,820
Maybe you’re a beginner

881

and you’re really into skiing right now,

882
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,900
but skiing

883
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,690
isn’t really

884
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,570
what you think.

885
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,490
This sport isn’t romantic,

886
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,940
or girly.

887
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,300
It's not an entertaining sport.

888
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,900
I'm not going to make skiing entertainment.

00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,490
I really think

890
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,050
it's a great theme.

891
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,650
I think the spirit of skiing

892
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,090
is very similar to the spirit of zealous anime.

893
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,300

00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,050
to reach the highest point.

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,170
I'll make you the protagonist?

912
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,380
Don't worry.

913
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,740

916
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,490
that you taught me carefully,

917
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,530

From putting on skis to sideslip,
