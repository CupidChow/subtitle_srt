29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,900
Alright,

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,020
come on in.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,900
Zhi,

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,210
bring your friends to the living room.

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,260
Zhi, your place is huge.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,770
Make yourselves at home.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,740
Come on, take a seat.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,540
Sit here.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,290
Wei Zhi,

38
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,690
if you have time,

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,410
take your friends to the sports club

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,850
or host a tea party

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,900

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,450
Learn from Ms. Zhou's daughter.

43
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,260
She invites friends over

44
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,610
for afternoon tea all the time.

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,010
She seems to have a lot of free time.

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,540
Does she even have a job?

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,660
Of course.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,340
She also married a man

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,060
from a similar background, and he moved in

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,060

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,260

Mrs. Wei,

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,010
can I sit next to you?

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
Of course.

55
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,340
What were you saying?

56
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,730
What happened to Ms. Zhou and her son-in-law?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,820
Don't worry about it.

58
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,980
Mr. and Mrs. Wei,

59
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,690
I didn't expect

60
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,820
to trouble you on this trip to Nancheng,

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,410
so I didn't bring a gift.

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,280
My apologies.

63
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,170
It's fine.

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,540
We don't

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,340
lack anything.

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,940
What was his name again?

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,340
It's Shan Chong, Dad.

68
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,370
Shan Chong,

69
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,690
you and your sister are both from the north.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,940
Zhi,

71
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,940
show them around Nancheng

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,340
if you have time.

73
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,240
Let them experience our local culture.

74
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,010
Zhi spends all day

75
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,500
holed up in her apartment drawing.

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,010
She barely goes out.

77
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,660
What would she know

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,010
about fun places in Nancheng?

79
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,730
Of course I do.

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,660
I've planned everything.

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
I'll show them around.

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,850
I know how bad

83
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,010
your social skills are,

84
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,260
so I thought I'd save you the trouble.

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,130
Thanks, Mom.

86
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,890
Don't worry, Mrs. Wei.

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,850
Even if Zhi doesn't know where to take them,

88
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,450
I do.

89
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,500
Besides, we young people

90
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,010
like doing things our way.

91
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,170
- Thank you. - Don't worry, Mrs. Wei.

92
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,610
- Zhi and I will take good care... - Thanks.

93
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,260
of them.

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,940
- Thanks, Yiming, for helping Zhi out. - Thanks.

95
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,980
It's nothing.

96
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,610
Yeah, Mrs. Wei,

97
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,450
Zhi is capable and independent.

98
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
She'll take good care of us.

99
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,660
Don't worry about it.

100
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,220
Alright.

101
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,410
As long as you all have fun,

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,610
I'm happy.

103
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,690
I made some soup

104
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,820
and a few side dishes.

105
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,220
Come try my cooking.

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,940
Come on.

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Let's eat.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,570
Chong, come on.

109
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,220
Let's go, Mrs. Wei.

110
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,100
It's been so long since I had this soup.

111
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,850
Didn't you say

112
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,130
you'd teach me how to make it?

113
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,610
Sure.

114
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,610
Just come by often.

115
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,820
Fish maw?

116
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,010
I really lucked out today.

117
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,730
Yeah.

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,260
I got my hands

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,060
on some aged, premium stuff

120
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,940
and soaked it today.

121
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,700
Enjoy, kids.

122
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,140
You've all just

123
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,780
come from freezing weather.

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,900
This fish maw, conch, and pork bone soup

125
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,900
will warm you right up.

126
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,580
You two girls should

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,540
have more.

128
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,780
It's great for your skin.

129
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm already full from drinking water.

130
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,340
This fish maw soup is amazing, so flavorful.

131
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,170
Shan Chong, Shan Shan,

132
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,170
try it.

133
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,580
I'm digging in.

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,410
Eat it while it's hot.

135
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,730
It won't taste as good once it cools.

136
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,930
Dig in.

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,930
Thanks, Mrs. Wei.

138
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,020
And about the prostheses,

139
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,290
thank you,

140
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,930
Yiming and Zhi.

141
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,700
Don't mention it.

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm a professional. You can count on me.

143
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,780
Don't worry.

144
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,290
Exactly.

145
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,730
Yiming's hospital

146
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,050
has one of the best orthopedic departments.

147
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,540
You're in good hands.

148
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,490
That's right. The Spring Festival is coming up.

149
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,290
You traveled so far to get here.

150
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,370
Get prosthetic legs as soon as possible,

151
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,220
and moving around will be much easier.

152
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,660
Having to rely on a wheelchair every day

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,730
at such a young age

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,220
must be tough.

155
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm used to it.

156
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,220
I lost my legs after taking a bad fall during snowboarding training.

157
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,100
But chasing dreams always comes with a price, right?

158
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,020
Snowboarding cost you your legs?

159
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,580
That's way too dangerous.

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,730
Wei Zhi, you must not go snowboarding anymore.

161
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,660
Mom, they were professional athletes

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,700
training for the national team.

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,580
I'm just a beginner. It's not the same.

164
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,610
Mrs. Wei, don't worry.

165
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,540
Shan Chong is a professional coach.

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,580
Zhi will be fine.

167
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,020
You're a snowboarding coach?

168
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,930
Wei Zhi and I

169
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,220
met through snowboarding.

170
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,490
I'm her...

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,660
coach.

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,340
Shan Chong is being modest.

173
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,370
You have no idea how skilled he is.

174
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,250
Even when caught in an avalanche, he...

175
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,140
An avalanche?

176
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,540
You two got caught in an avalanche?

177
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,700
It was just a small one.

178
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,780
Luckily, we weren't there when it happened.

179
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,290
You scared me.

180
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,250
Right,

181
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,100
I was actually talking about the avalanche

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,340
in the news.

183
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,700
But falling is inevitable, right?

184
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,900
Being on the snow every day,

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,340
you can't possibly never fall.

186
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,850
Right, Coach?

187
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,170
True.

188
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,410
You can't learn to snowboard

189
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,660
without falling.

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,220
But I have my turtle pad.

191
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,900
It keeps me from getting hurt.

192
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,250
A turtle pad?

193
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,020
Relying on such a risky sport

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,980
to make a living

195
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,540
must be tough.

196
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,730
So how much do you make...?

197
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,410
Mom!

198
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,610
It depends on how many students I have.

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,580
But Shan Chong is different.

200
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,730
He's incredibly skilled and well-respected.

201
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,100
He has students everywhere.

202
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,980
Someone like me,

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,580
with no talent,

204
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,540
wouldn't even qualify for his classes.

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,540
You even turn down students?

206
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,810
So your income must be...

207
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,810
Zhi has never been great

208
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,850
at sports.

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,900
Does she have any talent for snowboarding?

210
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,930
Why didn't you turn her down?

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,250
She...

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,700
She's not too skinny,

213
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,020
which helps her stay balanced.

214
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,850
Balanced?

215
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,700
Girls don't need

216
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,370
to be skinny.

217
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,980
As long as they're presentable

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
and well-mannered, that's enough.

219
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,170
Boys, on the other hand,

220
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,900
should at least have a stable income,

221
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,340
if not great wealth.

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,810
Otherwise,

223
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,460
how are they going to support a family in the future?

224
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,700
Am I right?

225
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,660
In this regard,

226
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,610
Yiming is outstanding.

227
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,540
Mrs. Wei,

228
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,700
you're making me blush.

229
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,020
Actually, Shan Chong is outstanding too.

230
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,220
Did you know?

231
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,250
He has a chance

232
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,540
to rejoin the national team

233
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,900
and compete for the country.

234
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,460
Rejoin the national team?

235
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,050
That's impressive.

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,140
He really is.

237
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,850
He was on the national team before.

238
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,410
Then why did he leave?

239
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,610
At the end of the day,

240
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,020
athletes have a short career.

241
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,580
Doctors, on the other hand,

242
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,220
keep moving up

243
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,700
once they're in the system.

244
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,130
The older they get, the more valuable they become.

245
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,420
Right, Yiming?

246
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,490
Well,

247
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,580
not necessarily.

248
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,300
Times

249
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,820
have changed.

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,730
Even doctors

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,010
switch careers now.

252
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,890
And with technological advancements,

253
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,890
AI is evolving rapidly.

254
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,420
- It can even... - Then let me ask you, Yiming.

255
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,370
If you

256
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,100
could choose again,

257
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,820
would you become a snowboarding coach instead?

258
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,980
Probably not,

259
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,940
mostly because I don't have the talent

260
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,100
or what it takes

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,300
to make the national team.

262
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,100
Even if I trained,

263
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,250
there's no guarantee I'd get in

264
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,730
and compete for the country.

265
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,010
And even if you got in, so what?

266
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,340
There are so many athletes on the national team.

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,940
Not everyone wins gold medals.

268
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,980
- Shan Chong can. - I can.

269
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,580
I believe

270
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,460
that as long as he makes it back to the team,

271
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,700
he'll win gold.

272
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,700
I believe in him too.

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,820
I've seen Shan Chong snowboard.

274
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,250
He'll definitely win gold.

275
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,940
Young man,

276
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,530
I admire your ambition.

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,700
If you can make the national team

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,940
and win a championship,

279
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,250
that would be

280
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,940
truly

281
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,700
impressive.

282
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,770
Here.

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,770
I have faith in you.

284
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,370
Here's to you

285
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,850
making it to the national team.

286
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,530
Cheers!

287
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,700
Thank you.

288
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,580
- Cheers. - Mrs. Wei,

289
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,610
cheers.

290
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,300
This fish maw soup is incredible.

291
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,820
It tastes just like before.

292
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,220
Zhi,

293
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,850
isn't this your favorite?

294
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,700
Have some more.

295
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm watching my weight.

296
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,730
Can we talk?

297
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,180
I want to apologize

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,580
for how my mom

299
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,820
treated you.

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,530
It's fine.

301
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm just Shan Shan's brother

302
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,340
and your snowboarding coach.

303
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm sorry too.

304
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,490
I admit it.

305
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,850
I wasn't ready

306
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,530
to officially

307
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
introduce you to them.

308
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,300
You thought I couldn't handle it?

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,250
Of course not.

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,420
To be honest,

311
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,770
my parents and I

312
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,980
aren't that close.

313
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,180
When I was little,

314
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,250
they were always

315
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,300
busy with work

316
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,340
and barely came home.

317
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,850
I was practically raised

318
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,460
by my nanny.

319
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,180
Then, in my senior year of high school,

320
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,730
they suddenly became more present.

321
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,100
But instead

322
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,300
of acting out

323
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,890
like some

324
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,250
rebellious kid on TV,

325
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,220
I tried to build

326
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,850
a relationship with them.

327
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,130
I even gave up my dream

328
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
of applying

329
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,460
to art school

330
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,490
just to please them.

331
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,460
But aren't you living the way you want now?

332
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,220
That's right.

333
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,250
After I

334
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,890
started university,

335
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,060
I had to face things

336
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,580
I absolutely hated every day.

337
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,000
Then one day,

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,010
it suddenly hit me.

339
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,770
I realized my life

340
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,890
is my own to live.

341
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,730
I should be the one

342
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,940
making my choices and decisions.

343
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,300
Even if they

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,460
disapprove,

345
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,490
I will do my best

346
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,700
to prove myself to them.

347
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,060
I never knew you had

348
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,340
such a strong mind even as a kid.

349
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,010
Alright,

350
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,890
enough about me.

351
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,890
Let's talk about you.

352
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,730
What I said earlier

353
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,820
at the table

354
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,980
about winning gold

355
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,250
and all that

356
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,010
was just to shut my mom up.

357
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,770
Don't take it to heart.

358
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,180
She's tough on the outside

359
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,010
but soft on the inside.

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,130
Don't let her words

361
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,610
get to you.

362
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,340
Chong?

363
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,700
Hey, my dear brother?

364
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,010
What's wrong?

365
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,100
Why are you being gross?

366
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,220
I just wanted to see

367
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,010
how long you'd zone out

368
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,940
before noticing me.

369
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,250
Careful, it's hot.

370
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,100
Chong,

371
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,220
it's

372
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,730
all my fault.

373
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,460
What are you talking about?

374
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,250
Well,

375
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,490
let's be real.

376
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,370
Their family and ours

377
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,730
are from completely different worlds.

378
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,300
If I hadn't been there,

379
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,300
you probably would've made

380
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,300
a great first impression.

381
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,850
I mean, you're handsome.

382
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,580
And good looks do count for something, right?

383
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,530
This has nothing to do with you.

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Don't overthink it.

385
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,610
Well,

386
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,300
what did Zhi

387
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,180
say to you?

388
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,010
She told me

389
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,820
not to worry.

390
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,890
She said her parents' opinions

391
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,940
wouldn't affect our relationship.

392
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,940
Really?

393
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,820
That's amazing!

394
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,700
She really is my idol.

395
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,980
Chong,

396
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,890
I think you should

397
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,100
just relax

398
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,250
and trust Zhi.

399
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,250
A girlfriend like her

400
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,530
is one

401
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,490
in a million.

402
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,250
That's exactly why I can't

403
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,010
just sit back

404
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,850
and take her for granted.

405
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,300
Hello?

406
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,250
Hello, Coach Shan.

407
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,180
This is Wei Zhi's father.

408
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,980
Would you be free tomorrow

409
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,650
for a private chat?

410
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,770
Thanks for waiting.

411
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,940
Thank you.

412
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,900
Sir.

413
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,940
Coach Shan.

414
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,730
Just call me Chong.

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,330
Have a seat.

416
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,620
Chong,

417
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,530
actually, Wei Zhi's mom

418
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,330
wanted to come along today,

419
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,420
but I figured

420
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,180
it'd be simpler for us men

421
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,380
to talk one-on-one.

422
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,330
I'll get straight to the point.

423
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,940
I hope you don't mind.

424
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,530
Please, go ahead.

425
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,460
Tell me the truth.

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,380
Are you and Wei Zhi

427
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,730
in a relationship?

428
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,770
Yes.

429
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,700
Sir,

430
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,010
I came to Nancheng this time

431
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,730
mainly for my sister's legs.

432
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,530
I felt bad showing up

433
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,620
empty-handed,

434
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,400
so I didn't tell you and Mrs. Wei

435
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,420
about my relationship with Wei Zhi.

436
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,530
But I never

437
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,980
meant any disrespect.

438
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,490
I just wanted to find

439
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,700
a better opportunity

440
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,940
to formally

441
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,980
meet you both.

442
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,860
Don't be nervous.

443
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,620
I can tell

444
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,940
you've got

445
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,770
good manners.

446
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,900
And you're not bad-looking either.

447
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,730
Actually, scratch that.

448
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,050
You're quite handsome.

449
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,330
I bet you have plenty of girls after you.

450
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,980
So tell me,

451
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,380
why did you

452
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,700
choose my daughter?

453
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,860
I'm flattered, sir.

454
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,380
I...

455
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,090
I think Wei Zhi

456
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,290
is a kind,

457
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,620
courageous,

458
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,220
and incredible person.

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,420
To me,

460
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,250
she's truly special.

461
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,530
Of course she is.

462
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,770
My daughter

463
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,810
is outstanding.

464
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,860
She basically

465
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,980
raised herself.

466
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,330
Her mother and I were too busy

467
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,420
to be there for her.

468
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,220
That's our

469
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,810
biggest regret

470
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,940
as parents.

471
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,380
Maybe we'll never

472
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,530
be able to fully make it up to her.

473
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,090
Even now, it feels

474
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,810
like there's always

475
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,220
a distance between us.

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,660
She even moved out

477
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,810
to pursue a career in comics.

478
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,460
We didn't want her to,

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,250
but there was nothing we could do.

480
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,620
Sir,

481
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,570
if you

482
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,700
and Mrs. Wei

483
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,330
could show more support for her,

484
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,220
maybe things between you would...

485
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,570
Comics

486
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,380
are just stories for kids.

487
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,940
It's a tough field,

488
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,620
and there's

489
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,770
no guarantee of success.

490
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,050
Being a comic artist is her dream.

491
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,250
She's been

492
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,530
working hard for it,

493
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,330
and she's talented.

494
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,140
She's already made a name

495
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,730
for herself in the industry.

496
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,250
It's good to have dreams,

497
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,700
but can dreaming

498
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,140
put food on the table?

499
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,530
You young people want freedom,

500
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,530
and I get that.

501
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,050
But as parents, our biggest concern

502
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,810
is whether our children can have a good life,

503
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,530
avoid unnecessary hardships,

504
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,730
and struggle less.

505
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,900
For a girl,

506
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,560
marriage is one

507
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,200
of the biggest decisions in life.

508
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,620
It's not something to be taken lightly.

509
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,090
So,

510
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,660
I hope

511
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,290
you can understand

512
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,050
where we're coming from.

513
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,290
Alright?

514
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,460
You've always been based in Xicheng, right?

515
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,290
Here, have a cup of tea.

516
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,220
Thank you, sir.

517
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,250
You're welcome.

518
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,810
It depends on the condition of the ski resorts.

519
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,460
In winter,

520
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,700
I'm mainly in Beishan and Xicheng.

521
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,700
In summer, I work in places like Nancheng,

522
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,140
where there are indoor ski facilities.

523
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,090
That's a lot of traveling.

524
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,490
Let me ask you something.

525
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,220
You have to be young

526
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,460
to be a snowboarding coach, right?

527
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,660
Can you keep doing it past 40?

528
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,530
And you have a sister.

529
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,330
Her treatment

530
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,570
must cost quite a bit, right?

531
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,380
Sir,

532
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,980
I have plenty of students,

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,330
and my rates aren't low.

534
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,140
Supporting my sister isn't a problem.

535
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,290
Earning for two and taking care of your sister?

536
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,290
That's a lot.

537
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,220
It's fine, sir.

538
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,010
Shan is my little sister.

539
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,090
It's only right that I

540
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,620
do everything I can for her.

541
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,420
Maybe you don't know Zhi well enough.

542
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,140
She's always lived

543
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,900
a comfortable life.

544
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,330
Our biggest regret

545
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,140
is not being there for her

546
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,220
as she grew up.

547
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,900
You spend your life traveling north and south,

548
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,900
rarely staying in one place.

549
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,900
How will you make time for Zhi?

550
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,250
She grew up without us by her side.

551
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,940
If her future partner

552
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,660
couldn't be there for her either,

553
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,260
what kind of life

554
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,380
would that be?

555
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,860
I admit

556
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,570
I haven't thought that far ahead.

557
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,420
But I'm sure Zhi

558
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,900
has her own thoughts on this.

559
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,290
It's something we can figure out together.

560
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,660
That's the problem with you young people.

561
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,420
You jump in headfirst

562
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,660
and ignore the practical issues.

563
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,090
Am I right?

564
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,570
Sir,

565
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,980
I didn't know

566
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,620
about Wei Zhi's family background.

567
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,290
But since I've decided

568
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,250
to be with her,

569
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,730
I'll work hard for our future.

570
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,050
Once I take care of my sister's prostheses,

571
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,570
I'll return to the national team.

572
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,090
I'll prove myself

573
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,050
to you and Mrs. Wei.

574
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,570
I've looked into you.

575
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,290

I was about to call you?

609
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,310

Look.

Isn't it adorable?

But I still think

614
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,460
my turtle pad is cuter.

the reason

619
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,490
I asked to meet you today is simple.

620
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,810
I just wanted to tell you

621
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,250
that Zhi's mother and I

622
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,380
share the same opinion.

623
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,420
We only want

624
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,730
our daughter

625
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,660
to have a happy

626
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,810
and stable future.

627
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,980
Right now,

628
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,290
that's something you can't provide.

629
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,140
Sir,

630
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,010
I understand

631
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,810
where you're coming from,

632
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,700
but...

633
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,730
I really love Wei Zhi.

634
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,460
Can you and Mrs. Wei give me a chance?

635
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,140
Chong,

636
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,180
maybe we seem selfish

637
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,460
to you,

638
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,140
but I do think highly

639
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,090
of you.

640
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,290
You're responsible,

641
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,700
and you have a strong sense of duty.

642
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,380
But that alone

643
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,250
isn't enough

644
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,900
for us to entrust

645
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,980
our daughter

646
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,250
to you.

647
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,380
Are you having fun?

648
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,140
Thank you.

649
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,420
For what?

650
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,380
For everything.

651
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,570
Are you worried

652
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,940
about Shan?

653
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,810
Or are you

654
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,810
anxious to return to the national team?

655
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,490
Don't stress yourself out so much.

656
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,220
Seeing you like this makes me worry.

657
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,090
Shan Chong,

658
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,810
do you know

659
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,010
why I'm so into you?

660
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,140
At first,

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,860
I was just drawn

662
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,490
to the looks of Mr. Glasses Cloth.

663
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,220
It was just a silly crush.

664
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,570
Then,

665
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,570
you came into my life.

666
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,900
You were so sharp-tongued,

667
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,900
and you drove me crazy every day.

668
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,010
But

669
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,730
when I found out

670
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,290
you were Mr. Glasses Cloth,

671
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,620
I actually felt

672
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,700
quite giddy inside.

673
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,250
Over time,

674
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,490
I discovered more and more

675
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,140
of your good qualities.

676
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,980
You're serious about what you do,

677
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,380
insanely talented,

678
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,380
and ambitious.

679
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,290
You're also incredibly responsible

680
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,290
to your friends, your family,

681
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,770
and most importantly,

682
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,620
to me.

683
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,010
Alright,

684
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,900
enough of that.

685
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,810
Let's just say

686
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,700
it was love at first sight.

687
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,860
We met in Nancheng.

688
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,490
Then we went to Beishan

689
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,530
and Xicheng together.

690
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,770
And now,

691
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,770
we're back in Nancheng.

692
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,250
Don't you think

693
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,860
this feels

694
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,010
like fate?

695
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,730
Sometimes I think

696
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,220
that if my life

697
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,770
were a comic book,

698
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,010
the male lead of my story

699
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,420
would definitely still be you.

700
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,980
What's wrong?

701
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,140
Are you so touched

702
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,620
that you can't even speak?

703
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm sorry.

704
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,250
Sorry for what?

705
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,620
Can you give me some time?

706
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,180
What are you going to do?

707
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,860
Wei Zhi,

708
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,380
right now,

709
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,530
I might not be able

710
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,570
to prove to your father

711
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,700
that I can give you the life you deserve.

712
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,090
What do you mean?

713
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,660
Why do you need to prove it to him?

714
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,530
I really have nothing to offer you right now.

715
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,420
I never asked for anything.

716
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,420
But I can't just ignore it.

717
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,460
I can't let myself

718
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,570
take your love for granted

719
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,770
while you shoulder

720
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,380
your parents' doubts

721
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,140
and worries alone.

722
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,660
I have to think about our future

723
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,620
and the challenges

724
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,570
we might face.

725
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,250
Challenges?

726
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,570
What challenges?

727
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,250
Wei Zhi,

728
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,620
I want to be

729
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,490
with you for life.

730
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,700
I want

731
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,620
to be with you,

732
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,010
hand in hand, head held high,

733
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,620
without fearing anyone's doubts.

734
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,460
But right now,

735
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,250
I can't give you that.

736
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,860
Maybe to you,

737
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,290
I seem invincible on the slopes,

738
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,330
but life isn't a ski resort.

739
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,570
It doesn't snow in Nancheng.

740
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,700
I need to step up

741
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,050
and build a future

742
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,730
that is stable and secure

743
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,730
for both of us.

744
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,380
So,

745
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,210
let's take some time apart.

746
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay?

747
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,780
No!

748
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,490
I... I know

749
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,170
my mom wasn't

750
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,130
exactly respectful to you,

751
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,050
but I'll talk to her.

752
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,490
I'll explain everything.

753
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,940
I'll make her

754
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,940
believe

755
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,300
in what we have.

756
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,170
Don't say things like this to me,

757
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,940
okay?

758
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,820
I'll do everything I can

759
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,940
and take the shortest time possible

760
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,090
to prove I can give you a happy life.

761
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,090
So,

762
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,010
just because of this,

763
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,010
you're breaking up

764
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,210
with me?

765
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,010
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,530
Fine.

767
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,130
Fine.

768
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,460
