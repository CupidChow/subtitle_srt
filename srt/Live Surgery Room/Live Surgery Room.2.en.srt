195
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,570

196

197
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,670

202

203
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,190
Actually,

204
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,980
it's common

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,950
that you can't find out the cause
of the disease.

206
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
My son looked it up on the Internet.

207
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,310
Herniated discs

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,710

209
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,120
but you want me
to go to the rheumatology clinic.

210
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,400
What can I find out?

211
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,550
Is there any back pain?

212
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,000
My back

213
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,070
has been hurting more and more
over the years.

214
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,400
Is there a pattern to the pain?

215
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,120
What do you mean by "pattern"?

216
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,550
The pain gets worse after I move around

217
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,000
or after work.

218
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,600
Yes.

219
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,070
Just a few kilos of groceries

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,240

221
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,550
my butt hurts when I get home.

222
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,640

223
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,880

224
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,590

229
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,000
They want me to see a rheumatologist.

230
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,760
Chest pain or not?

231
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,310
What?

232

233
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,070
I suspect

234
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,550

235
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,240

239
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,910
A percentage of patients

240

develop shingles,

241
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,640
which causes symptoms

242
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,710
of chest pain.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
It is recommended

244
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,880
that you go to a rheumatologist

245
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,430
for a PETCT

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,950
or whole-body bone tomography.

247
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,760
Then we can confirm it.

251
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,980
You can go
to the rheumatology department

252
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,760
of another hospital and ask them

253
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280

She has acne on her face.

266
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,540
Her acne is different

267
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,660
from the norm.

268
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,760
It's also called paradoxical acne

or acneconglobata.

Those who suddenly develop acne

271

272
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,400

and asked her
to go to the rheumatologist?

Mr. Zheng,

00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,720
by the way,

278
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
is it appropriate

279
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,590
to send our own patients

280
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,280
to other hospitals?

281
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,520
You're a doctor

282
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,310
who doesn't tell his patients

283
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,430
what's wrong with them.

284
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,830
You knew the cause of the disease,
but you were vague

285
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
and continued to induce her
to spend tons of money

286

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
that she needs to go elsewhere

for her diagnosis.

291

296
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:28,950
that she has

What if the patient complains?

299

to have those tests done.

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,720
Did you call her family?

386
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,760
Her parents are dead.

387
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,790
She has a husband,

388
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,040
but we can't reach him.

389
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,040
Keep calling.

390
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,350
We have to get in touch with him.

391
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,830
Xiu.

392
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,150
I'll go with you.

393
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,070
Zhou, contact Chang Yue.

394
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,080
[Name: Yu Yunxia]

395
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,220
[Checkups: Abdominal Ultrasound
(Liver, Gallbladder, Spleen)]

396
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,780
[(Pancreas, Kidneys) Normal]

397
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,830
Don't irritate her.

398
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,720
I won't.

399
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,080
Don't come over.

400
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,110
Don't come over.

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,280
- OK.
- Don't come over.

402
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,240
Xia.

403
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,080
Don't come over.

404
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,760
Xia.

405
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Xia, don't.

406
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,240
Xia.

407
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,520
I read your medical records.

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,110
You've had a relapse,

409
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
but you're still operable.

410
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,040
It's terminal.

411
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,560
Operable?

412
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,520
Superselective
intra-arterial embolization.

413
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you know

414
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,150
superselective
intra-arterial embolization?

415
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,430
Depending on your condition,

416
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,390
there is a more effective way

417
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,040
than chemotherapy

418
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
and taking targeting drugs.

419
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,590
Believe me.

420
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,630
Your disease can be cured

421
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,830
I can cure you.

422
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,560
Thanks.

423
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,630
But there's no hope for me.

424
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,000
No hope.

425
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,430
Why?

426
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,760
The last time I was diagnosed,

427
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,240
I didn't have enough money
for the operation.

428
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,910
All of you

429
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,760
raised money

430
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,670
to help pay for my surgery.

431
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,190
After the surgery,

432
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,800
I want

433
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,960
to live my life seriously

434
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
for all of you.

435
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,110
I...

436
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
I take my medication regularly,

437
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,520
have regular checkups,

438
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,910
and work hard

439
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
so that I can

440
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,390
earn more money

441
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,480
to pay you all back.

442
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,480
I really want

443
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,670
and try to live well.

444
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,480
But...

445
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,670
But...

446
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,190
Why?

447
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,630
Why is God

448
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,870
doing this to me?

449
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,000
Xia.

450
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,190
Believe me.

451
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,590
Your illness can be cured.

452
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,040
No.

453
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,390
I won't accept treatment.

454
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,870
So many people

455
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,760
try so hard to live

456
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,590
but have no choice,

457
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,910
but do you give up

458
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,560
while you have a choice?

459
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,320
I don't have a choice either.

460
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,760
I never did.

461
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,560
You do.

462
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,080
I don't.

463
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,240
I'll pay you back

464
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,590
in my next life what I owe you.

465
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,000
Xia.

466
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,720
Xia.

467
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,520
Xia.

468
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,630
Xia.

469
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Yue.

470
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Dr. Chang.

471
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,190
Dr. Chang.

472
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,080
Thank you for saving me last time,

473
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry

474
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,480
for making it in vain.

475
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,400
After being in the hospital
for a long time,

476
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,860
I realized

477
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,480
that people like me

478
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,720
don't deserve to be saved.

479
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,110
A person must be saved

480
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,800
once in the hospital.

481
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,870
The meaning and value of life
in a hospital

482
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,000
are above all else.

483
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,910
That's why

484
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,110
hospitals exist.

485
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,320
Stop it.

486
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,590
Xia.

487
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,480
I know what you're going through.

488
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,390
Having come this far,

489
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,080
I'll support you

490
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,670
in whatever decision you make.

491
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,430
Even if you want to jump,

492
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,720
I won't stop you.

493
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,630
This is the tree peony

494
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,870
you gave me

495
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,670
when you got well.

496
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,280
You said you've kept it for years.

497
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,560
When the flowers bloom,
they're gorgeous,

498
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
like the clouds in the sky.

499
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,560
I didn't lie to you.

500
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,350
It blooms really beautifully,

501
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,870
but I'm too busy

502
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,110
to take care of it.

503
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,240
It never bloomed

504
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,560
when it was with me,

505
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,720
so I brought it here today

506
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,910
to give it back to you.

507
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,630
You don't want it?

508
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,190
OK.

509
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,320
Then I don't want it either.

510
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,000
No.

511
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,720
Don't throw it away.

512
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,120
I've kept it for three years.

513
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,360
It's still fine.

514
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm sure it'll bloom.

515
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,950
Don't throw it away.

516
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,830
Don't.

517
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,320
Then you should be fine.

518
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,110
It

519
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,870
can be cured.

520
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,190
Really.

521
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,910
Can it be cured?

522
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,350
Yes.

523
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,240
Really.

524
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,430
Dr. Chang.

525
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,590
It's okay.

526
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
It's okay.

527
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,430
Thank you.

528
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,590
I'm sorry

529
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,480
for the trouble, officer.

530
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,240
We've stopped her.

531
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,320
Yes.

532
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,280
We'll be sure

533
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
to give her psychological counseling.

534
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes, sir.

535
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,480
Thank you.

536
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,830
Bye.

537
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,240
Go ahead.

538
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,260
I know you can do

539
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
superselective
intra-arterial embolization,

540
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,060
but as you heard,

541
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,580
she has no money.

542
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,910
Her family doesn't support it.

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,870
A surgery is that price.

544
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,670
Plus pre-op tests

545
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,390
and post-op care,

546
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,870
which are needed more than once.

547
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,430
She additionally needs many surgeries,

548
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,590
during which she is not able to work.

549
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,190
Who's going to pay
for her medical bills?

550
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,870
But she's part of Haicheng Hospital.

551
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,320
She's outsourced.

552
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,110
Temporary worker.

553
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,350
I can't do this surgery

554
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,520
for free.

555
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
We're not a charity.

556
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,720
Looks like you're no different

557
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,560
than my teacher.

558
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,280
Stop right there.

559
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,590
Get it straight.

560
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,480
Haicheng Hospital

561
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
was originally founded with the idea

562
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,080
of becoming the Manou of China.

563
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,150
Bu told you that?

564
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,150
But Manou wasn't founded

565
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,350
to make money.

566
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,320
Before it became

567
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,190
the most profitable hospital,

568
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,760
it was the hospital

569
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,350
best at curing.

570
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,150
Mr. Bu has made a lot of money

571
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,150
in his life,

572
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,080
but so what?

573
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,830
The money

574
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,280
didn't make him happier

575
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,830
or live longer.

576
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,520
He has lived longer.

577
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,080
Can he have this operation and live

578
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,870
without the money?

579
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,190
What will keep him alive

580
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,670
is more and more advanced
medical technology,

581
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,480
not money.

582
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,800
Mr. Bu is aware

583
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,350
of that.

584
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,760
He thinks the first half of his life

585
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,670
was meaningless.

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,830
And what about you?

587
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,240
You've taken over Haicheng Hospital.

588
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,670
Do you want the rest of your life

589
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
to be so meaningless?

590
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,390
Hospitals exist

591
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,110
to heal people.

592
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
Are you done?

593
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,280
Yes.

594
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,720
There are still people

595
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,870
like that these days.

596
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,190
Unbelievable.

597
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,390
Indeed.

598
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
Unbelievable.

599
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,760
I didn't expect him

600
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,670
to be so anti-motivational.

601
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,800
But, Hua.

602
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,240
Are you really divorcing Bu?

603
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,830
He's the one who wants to divorce me.

604
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,190
He wants to drink, get divorced,

605
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,960
and go to the countryside to farm.

606
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,320
What are you going to do?

607
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,670
What else can I do?

608
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,760
I'll divorce him

609
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,110
but take over Haicheng Hospital.

610
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,870
Have you thought

611
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,190
about the future of your business?

612
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,560
What?

613
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,870
Are you also going
to be anti-motivational?

614
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,430
No.

615
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,000
I hate that.

616
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,830
However,

617
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,910
that idiot just now

618
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
seems to be right.

619
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,520
The reason Manou Clinic

620
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,910
is the most profitable hospital

621
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,590
is that it's the best

622
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,830
at healing people.

623
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,150
Are you done?

624
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,110
Yes.

625
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Bed 759. Yu Yunxia's surgery

626
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,280
is on me.

627
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
Go to the third floor for your medicine

628
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,070
OK.

629
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,190
The balance is insufficient.

630
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,760
Wait a minute.

631
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,960
Doesn't work, either.

632
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,670
Still on you?

633
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,670
Miss Wang.

634
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,520
I can pay.

635
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,910
You're welcome.

636
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,520
Wait.

637
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,670
You...

638
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,190
My name is Xie Yiren.

639
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm sorry.

640
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,320
I...

641
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,830
I'm not good at remembering names.

642
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,480
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

643
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Can I charge interest?

644
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,110
How much?

645
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,910
It's your surgery.

646
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,800
In the future,

647
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,670
tell me a day in advance
of your surgery.

648
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,560
I'll try to transfer to another shift

649
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,280
to accommodate you.

650
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,670
Why?

651
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,280
Since I was a kid,
I've always loved watching surgeries,

652
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,960
especially difficult ones,

653
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
but I was afraid to do it myself,

654
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,150
so I became an equipment nurse.

655
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,080
I'm a very professional equipment nurse.

656
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,800
You should have seen it

657
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,870
during your last surgery.

658
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,080
If I'm going to provide you
with instruments,

659
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,590
you don't even have to say anything

660
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,320
before I can give them

661
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,110
to you in advance.

662
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,590
OK.

663
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,590
We'll work together.

664
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,630
Really?

665
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,630
You promised?

666
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,590
Superselective
intra-arterial embolization.

667
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,720
Tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

668
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,190
Got it.

669
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,190
Wait.

670
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,110
The machine...

671
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,020
[Pickup area]

672
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,520
Dr. Zheng.

673
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,280
Have some water.

674
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,240
See you tomorrow.

675
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,420
[Payment successful. Delivering...]

676
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,900
[Delivered.
Please take it from the pickup area.]

677
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,940
[Pickup area]

678
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,580
[Delivered.
Please take it from the pickup area.]

679
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,800
It's the end of the day.
You're still here?

680
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,240
Yes.

681
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,240
I heard you borrowed money

682
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,480
to pay the hospital deposit

683
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,280
for Yu Yunxia.

684
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,300
Do you realize that follow-up treatment

685
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,350
still requires a lot of money?

686
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,240
I've done some research.

687
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,720
There's no
superselective intra-arterial embolization

688
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
in Haicheng.

689
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,350
I can apply for reimbursement

690
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,110
from the government as a new program.

691
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,800
Up to half the amount.

692
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
And the other half?

693
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,040
Still on you?

694
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,670
What are you trying to say?

695
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm just curious

696
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,590
about what you think,

697
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,870
so I want to interview you.

698
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:04,960
First,

699
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,430
advanced liver cancer

700
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,190
may not be cured

701
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
even with that surgery.

702
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,350
Second,

703
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,190
even if the surgery is successful,

704
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,670
she'll have several more surgeries.

705
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,320
The expenses will be

706
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,190
around 10,000 each time.

707
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,280
How many times can you subsidize it?

708
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,350
Thirdly,

709
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,870
even if all is well,

710
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,280
she won't live for long.

711
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,670
Is her survival

712
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,430
worth that much?

713
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,190
Worth?

714
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
No parents. No children.

715
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
No husband now.

716
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,960
No degrees.

717
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,430
Even so,

718
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,390
are you going to save her?

719
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,480
I didn't realize

720
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,280
that one needs value to survive.

721
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,870
Survival doesn't require value,

722
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,240
but a person with value

723
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,800
can always survive longer.

724
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,080
So,

725
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,430
a doctor

726
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,240
who got disgraced

727
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,320
by medical malpractice,

728
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,760
who can no longer

729
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,760
perform surgery,

730
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,320
and who has lost his value,

731
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,110
deserves to die?

732
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,800
Thank you for coming to my defense.

733
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,350
We all have our opinions.

734
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,110
I have my ethics.

735
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,190
I'm going to radiology.

736
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,040
Radiology? At this hour?

737
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,630
No?

738
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,080
Why?

739
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,000
Because 64-slice CT

740
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,960
is not for emergency.

741
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,840
There's no one on duty.

742
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,440
Give me the key.

743
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,920
I can operate the machine myself.

744
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,150
Dr. Zheng.

745
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,520
You're new to the hospital,

746
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,190
so you might not know the rules

747
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,040
and regulations.

748
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,960
First of all,

749
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,190
Radiology and Intervention

750
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,440
were merged before,

751
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,960
but that was because of Mr. Bu.

752
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,110
Now you've been separated

753
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,400
to form a separate department,

754
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,520
so as a matter of principle,

755
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,400
the machines in Radiology

756
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,750
can only be operated by Radiologists.

757
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
People from other departments
can borrow them

758
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,360
but need to apply in advance.

759
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,040
And then, according to radiology rules,

760
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,080
I'm off duty.

761
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,520
My patient
needs surgery tomorrow morning,

762
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,790
so I have

763
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,670
to do the 3D reconstruction tonight.

764
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,400
Wait.

765
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
What do you want?

766
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,230
Miss Luo.

767
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,190
What's wrong, Miss Luo?

768
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,270
Come on.

769
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,150
Take it easy and sit down.

770
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,790
Miss Luo.

771
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,270
You look younger.

772
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,150
Long time no see, Su.

773
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,310
Yes.

774
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,520
The emergency department

775
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,520
is on call 24 hours a day.

776
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,400
We're not like you

777
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,360
who always get off on time.

778
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,110
You can also earn medical checkup fees.

779
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,310
What a good life.

780
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,110
But today,

781
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,920
someone doesn't want me to leave.

782
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,960
Calm down.

783
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,230
When do we start?

784
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
Don't talk, okay?

785
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,190
Miss Luo.

786
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,110
There's no other way.

787
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,040
This is the first case

788
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,230
of superselective
intra-arterial embolization here.

789
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,400
If we do this,

790
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,670
we'll be a great institution.

791
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,590
Don't bother yourself

792
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,310
arguing with the newcomers.

793
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,750
Come on.

794
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,360
Please.

795
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,040
But you know we don't...

796
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,630
Miss Luo.

797
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,590
You know it's hard

798
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,270
for interventionalists.

799
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,520
When I was an intern

800
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,270
in Interventional Medicine,

801
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,360
there was a surgery.

802
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,110
One of the patient's
tumor-feeding vessels

803
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,840
was branching off

804
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,080
from the phrenic artery.

805
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,150
At that time, my teacher and I

806
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,590
stood inside the operating room

807
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,880
for four hours in dozens
of pounds of lead clothing

808
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,440
before we found it.

809
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,750
If we had been able

810
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,920
to find it using 3-D reconstruction,

811
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,790
how much work would have been saved.?

812
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,920
Nine o'clock.

813
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,560
I have to be home by nine.

814
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,440
I'll drive you home myself.

815
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,150
Can we start now?

816
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,520
I ordered takeout.

817
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,310
Let's eat before work.

818
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,040
OK.

819
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,480
Let me call my family first.

820
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes, thank you.

821
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,080
Thank you.

822
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,670

824

What does "huh" mean?

825
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,000
The radiology department

826
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,000
doesn't care about patients' lives

827
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,150
and doesn't follow hospital rules.

828
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,710
It's all about favors and the back door.

829
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,400
And you

830
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,080
are not ashamed but proud of it.

831
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,480
That's what Haicheng Hospital is now.

832
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,270
What a crap.

833
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,960
Move away.

834
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,560
Buns again?

835
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,630
64-slice CT.

836
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,520
3-D reconstruction.

837
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,080
I need to study.

838
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,360
By the way, you don't need to work now

839
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,520
Why don't you go on a blind date?

840
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,440
What are you doing here?

Yun.

842
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,110
Only if there is a blind date.

843
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,750
When the girls found out
I was the chief resident,

844
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
they all turned me down.

845
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,270
I'd better learn more

846
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,560
so I can become chief soon.

847
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,710
Dream on.

848
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,630
Miss Luo.

849
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,560
How's Zheng doing?

850
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,560
Technology is advancing

851
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,790
so fast nowadays.

852
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,440
The surgeon can even do it himself.

853
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,480
In a few years' time,

854
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,590
maybe all of us
in the auxiliary department

855
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,440
should be laid off.

856
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,230
Yun.

857
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,360
What's Zheng doing here?

858
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,670
Looking for abnormal signaling shadows

859
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,670
on the edge of the liver

860
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,190
to see if that's the feeding artery

861
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:51,790
for the tumor.

862
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,880
That's a lot of work.

863
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,270
If every patient

864
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
needed this,

865
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,960
how much work would it take?

866
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,190
Good preparation can boost your work.

867
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,270
Here.

868
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,150
What?

869
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,270
A new artery.

870
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,270
It's done.

871
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,590
The vessel is from a branch
of the hepatic artery.

872
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,000
It needs to be verified during surgery.

873
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,630
The color drawings

874
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,750

No.

Miss Luo, I'll drive you home.

882
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,670
No, just go home.

883
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,710
