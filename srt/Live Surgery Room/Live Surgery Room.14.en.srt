Prostate Intervention?

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,520
How is that possible?

8
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,360
It's indeed hard for elderly men

9
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,800
with severe prostate enlargement.

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
A normal flexible urinary catheter
won't work,

11
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,670
so we need
to use a metal urethral probe,

12
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,910
but the prostate
doesn't have oxygen vessels.

13
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,270
It doesn't.

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,960
But there are capillaries,

15
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,030
especially in severe cases.

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,030
Their capillaries get bigger.

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,550
It's worth considering

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,550
the Interventional
Embolization Procedure.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes.

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,710

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,110
interventional embolization
of the prostatic artery

26
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,640
is effective

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,960
for prostate enlargement,

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,450
but as a new intervention,

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,290
it is currently not perfect

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,000
and generally ineffective,

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,410
so in the middle of next month,

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,800

You?

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm looking into
late liver intervention embolization.

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,470
I have a lot of new ideas.

44
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,800
Well, that's interesting.

45

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,560

You're wrong.

Don't you think it's a competition?

197
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
It is.

But not with people.

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,240
Doctors have always competed
with diseases,

to be resurrected.

I didn't mean that.

250
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,790
I do admit that there's a big gap
between Haicheng and Heidelberg.

Yun, I'm three years younger than you.

380
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,960
- We played basketball together.
- That's right.

381
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,270
Come on, sit.

382
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,560
Shouldn't we be checking patients?

383
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,670
What are you doing here?

384
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,480
Let's eat.

385
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,600
We'll see the patients after this.

386
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,200
Sit down.

387
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,570
Listen.

388
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,010
The biggest difference in Beida

389
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,210
is that you can order in the cafeteria.

390
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,240
It's on us today.

391
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,960
Just order what's expensive.

392
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,390
Are there dumplings?

393
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes.

394
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,150
This one.

395
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,080
I'll try this.

396
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,870
Ten plates of prawns.

397
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,000
OK, let's try some.

398
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,120
- That's good.
- OK.

399
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,030
Is this Dr. Wang?

400
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,200
Hi.

401
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,720
I was referred by Mrs. Lv.

402
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,010
What took you so long?

403
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,870
I've been waiting for you.

404
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm sorry.

405
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,630
Did you bring the image?

406
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,920
[Pale and bloodless]

407
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,020
[It's not hot, but she's sweating]

408
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,820
[One hand over her chest]

409
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,300
[One hand over his lower abdomen,
which was slightly elevated]

410
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,660
[Skeletonized, in pain]

411
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,510
Sorry.

412
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,440
Yun.

413
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,480
I'll take her
to the hospitalization office

414
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,030
for formalities.

415
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,440
Go ahead.

416
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,200
Come with me.

417
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,250
Come on.

418
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,070
Thank you.

419
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,080
I think it's terminal cancer.

420
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,150
Digestive.

421
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,240
She's so young.

422
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,210
The malignant tumor is too aggressive.

423
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,790
She may not have a chance to be cured.

424
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Can we send her
to a Chinese rehabilitation hospital

425
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,910
and get a Chinese doctor to fix her up?

426
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,160
What do you think, Yun?

427
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,830
Maybe.

428
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,870
Which one is better?

429
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,550
This one. Try this.

430
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,690
Yun.

431
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,030
I heard that the intervention seminar

432
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,830
was not going well.

433
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,760
Any rivals?

434
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,070
Just No. 3 Hospital.

435
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,550
It's not that simple, is it?

436
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,510
I heard

437
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,200
they invited Rudolph.

438
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,200
And Wansheng International

439
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,440
is behind them financially.

440
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,160
Wansheng.

441
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,270
That's

442
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,480
a Singaporean multinational
medical company.

443
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
It's the fifth-largest seller
in the world.

444
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,440
At this stage,

445
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,920
they're focusing on the domestic market.

446
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,590
More?

447
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,960
I heard

448
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,310
that they are

449
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,550
particularly interested

450
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,480
in this Prostate Intervention research.

451
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
They can use this opportunity
to publicize their catheters

452
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,750
to open up the Chinese market,

453
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,800
so they're betting

454
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,510
on Rudolph.

455
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,640
Did you hear that, 500?

456
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,480
You're going to have to step up.

457
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,270
Don't just eat dumplings.

458
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,790
They're buying. Eat more vegetables.

459
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Eat some eggs.

460
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,960
Eat it.

461
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,590
What kind of dumplings?

462
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,270
I'll try one.

463
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,680
What else is going on?

464
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
In this trial

465
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,030
of Prostate Intervention Embolization,

466
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,070
there is only one patient.

467
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,310
The family name is Wang.

468
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,440
A lot of doctors for just one patient?

469
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
It's an imperfect procedure,

470
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,830
so no one signed up for it,

471
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,970
but we have a lot
of liver cancer patients

472
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,190
in the hospital.

473
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,270
Director Kong has prepared
20 liver cancer patients.

474
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,550
You need to demonstrate

475
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,240
late liver intervention embolization
to them first.

476
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,510
Whoever does a good job

477
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,310
handles the prostate.

478
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,350
The competition is fierce.

479
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,800
Yeah, they're all afraid
of backroom deals.

480
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,390
Do you have any information
on the 20 patients?

481
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:39,830
Yes.

482
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,510
I knew Yun would need it,

483
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,440
so I prepared it early.

484
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,590
You've been smarter

485
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,330
than before.

486
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,640
Yes, thanks to you.

487
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,660
[Qin Liren]

488
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,360
[Patient's name:
Bai Li, Qin Liren, Yang Chen]

489
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,070
Hello.

490
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,350
Ms. Su.

491
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
This is Qin Liren.

492
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,680
I've been admitted to Beida.

493
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,750
Thank you.

494
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,720
Let me ask you something.

495
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,240
I heard

496
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,830
the best doctor here is Jin Yaowu,

497
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,640
isn't it?

498
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,550
No. It's Zheng Ren.

499
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,440
But Zheng Ren is only famous
at Haicheng Hospital

500
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,070
while Jin Yaowu is the favorite student
of Director Kong,

501
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,350
a major player
in the field of intervention.

502
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,160
He's said

503
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
to be the top of the new generation.

504
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,110
Please help me with that.

505
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
You can trust me.

506
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Definitely Zheng Ren.

507
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
He's the best.

508
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
Otherwise,

509
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,100
you can choose Su Yun.

510
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,070
But he's a bit unpredictable.

511
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,110
Really?

512
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,680
I'll consider it then.

513
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,400
Ms. Su.

514
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,720
By the way,
I have something to tell you.

515
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,770
There are three patients

516
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,880
in this ward.

517
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,070
Too many people. What a mess.

518
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,400
Like a vegetable market.

519
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,240
Can you help me

520
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,240
get a private room?

521
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,510
You know,

522
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,880
money is not a problem.

523
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I really can't help you

524
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
with that.

525
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,070
OK.

526
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,830
Got it.

527
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,820
That's it.

528
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm sorry.

529
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Honey.

530
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,360
Don't think so much.

531
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,150
Just settle down where you are.

532
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,680
I don't want to go in.

533
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,920
Don't go in there.

534
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,040
Honey.

535
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,960
Honey.

536
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,160
You are so...

537
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,610
The doctor said it's good for you
to eat more fruits.

538
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,790
Don't worry.
I'll go buy some more this afternoon.

539
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,940
OK.

540
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,640
Bro.

541
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,610
You've been waiting

542
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,670
for a long time, right?

543
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,800
We've been waiting in line
for more than 10 days

544
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,970
before getting in.

545
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,350
I waited outside for months.

546
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,640
I was lucky

547
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,070
to bump into Director Kong

548
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,510
to get in.

549
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,270
Are you all here

550
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,200
for that demonstration surgery too?

551
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,640
Yes, so are you all?

552
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

553
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,880
There

554
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,830
are so many doctors here.

555
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,920
I want to know

556
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,200
if I can get a good doctor.

557
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,790
I just want to get well soon.

558
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,590
I have to get back to work.

559
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,240
You have to go back to work?

560
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,720
Sir.

561
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,680
Let me ask you something.

562
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,830
Where do you work?

563
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,220
I'm with the Tricycle Association.

564
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,960
Tricycle Association?

565
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm a pedicab driver.

566
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,750
Regarding these liver cancer patients,

567
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,550

[Boundless Medicine - Chen Miao]

758
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,880
Thank you.

759
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,310
What smells so good?

760
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,160
Porridge.

761
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,550
Xiangshui Rice.

762
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,560
Good nose.

763
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
I guessed right?

764
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,480
I brought it from home.

765
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,070
Just two bags.

766
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,680
Then I have to eat more.

767
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,640
It's unsustainable.

768
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,830
500.

769
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Come and try 500 worth of rice.

770
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,640
Feel it.

771
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,960
It's too coarse, too hard.

772
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,070
Forget it. Come on, let's eat.

773
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,310
Sit down.

774
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,790
By the way,

775
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,450
I've asked around.

776
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,040
There's not much progress

777
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,220
in the research this time.

778
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,480
Prostate embolism

779
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,080
is due to the lack of
oxygen supplying arteries in the prostate.

780
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,110
As for the capillaries,

781
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,750
there are too many of them.

782
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,640
There's no way to embolize them.

783
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,640
Secondly, they're too thin.

784
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,960
The material requirements are very high.

785
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,860
Third.

786
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,240
It's very demanding

787
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,350
on the surgeon.

788
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,310
I went to the lab yesterday.

789
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,830
They've heard about this.

790
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,270
A few bosses were thinking about it

791
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
but not optimistic.

792
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,350
Are you done there?

793
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
Almost. Why?

794
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,870
Why don't you come with us

795
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,920
to the seminar today?

796
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,330
Speaking of which,

797
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,640
I heard a rumor yesterday.

798
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,310
What rumor?

799
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,900
The Canadian Society

800
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,640
of Interventional Radiology 2016

801
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,830
performed this procedure

802
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,860
on 68 patients

803
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,160
with lower urinary tract symptoms

804
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
of prostate enlargement.

805
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,510
People weren't very happy

806
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,480
with the results.

807
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,790
And this time, Wansheng International

808
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,360
opened a new production line

809
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,950
just for Rudolph

810
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,200
to specialize in thinner wires
and catheters.

811
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,590
Specialized production line?

812
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,590
Prostate Intervention Embolization

813
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,130
is not widely available,

814
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,350
and the new wires and catheters
are very expensive.

815
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,510
The average person can't afford them.

816
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,280
There's no way to make it back,

817
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,590
but they're doing it anyway.

818
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,440
Why?

819
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,510
Presumably,

820
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,020
there is a specific audience.

821
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,830
Maybe.

822
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
For normal prostate enlargement,

823
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,480
removal is enough.

824
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,590
There's no need for intervention.

825
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,680
The only people who need it

826
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,960
are those who are too old

827
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,510
and have blood clotting disorders

828
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
or heart problems.

829
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,270
If they get a strong stimulus

830
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,440
and go into cardiac arrest,

831
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,510
they're not going to get away with it.

832
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,920
But,

833
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,230
for those who are rich and old,

834
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,240
to have

835
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,240
a better life,

836
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,890
money is nothing.

837
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,400
Try it.

838
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,270
Try what?

839
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,960
I want to try this.

840
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,510
You want to use Chang Feng
against Wansheng?

841
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Why not?

842
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,510
Wansheng International
is the world's fifth-largest company

843
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,640
to develop

844
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,030
a covered cardiovascular stent.

845
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,880
Other tech companies

846
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,790
have also developed new models

847
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,830
of covered cardiovascular stents.

848
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,070
Then Wansheng's products
become a waste of space.

849
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
Then you should also know

850
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,590
that Wansheng International

851
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,720
has been trying to enter
the domestic market.

852
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,830
Once they succeed,

853
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,720
the first thing they will occupy

854
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,510
is Chang Feng MIO's market share.

855
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,160
Chang Feng is after all
a domestic company.

856
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,750
Material science is slow

857
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,680
to get a breakthrough,

858
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,920
especially in the area of intervention.

859
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,310
In both oncology

860
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,510
and cardiovascular interventions,

861
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,550
multinational supplies

862
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,460
work better than domestic ones.

863
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,350
Do you admit that?

864
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,160
Then tell me.

865
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,400
What reason is there
to choose Chang Feng?

866
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,070
Because it's cheaper.

867
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,580
Did I just say that

868
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,560
for nothing?

869
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,030
The bigwigs pushing for this surgery

870
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,110
are not lack of money.

871
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,550
But a lot of people are.

872
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,920
You said

873
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,070
that Prostate Intervention Embolization

874
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,000
has three difficulties.

875
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,550
Too many blood vessels.

876
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,510
Unsophisticated materials.

877
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,160
And the level of the surgeon.

878
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,310
So I'm wondering

879
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,270
if it can make up for the defects
in the material

880
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,440
when the level of the surgeon
is high enough.

881
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,280
But the operation time

882
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,670
and the time of the surgeon
and the patient

883
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,110
exposed to radiation will increase,

884
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,840
and the success rate of the operation
will decrease.

885
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,640
It's up to us.

886
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,110
Let's eat.

887
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,370
Dr. Zheng.

888
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,310
I beat this egg myself.

889
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,520
I didn't use a whisk.

890
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,110
They say eggs made

891
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,210
with a whisk have no soul.

892
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,920
Try it.

893
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,440
I also added a little sugar.

894
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,460
It's said that sugar
raises the temperature

895
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,900
at which the egg white solidifies

896
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,030

897
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,680
and has water retention properties

898
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,110
to make the egg more tender.

899
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,000
Dr. Zheng.

900
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,240
Do you think it's good?

901
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,030
It's a bit bland.

902
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,440
I'll add more salt next time.

903
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,240
It's okay to be bland.

904
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,510
It's healthier.

905
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,830
Let's eat faster.

906
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,830

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,720
In a minute.

908
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,920
He doesn't know how to appreciate it.

909
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,790
Feel lost?

910
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,350
Who? Appreciate what?

911
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,790
I'm done.

912
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,310
On the contrary,

913
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
Dr. Zheng makes himself sparkle

914
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,030
when he is like this.

915
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,880
I have an idea of what to get him.

My colleague, Zheng Ren.

Hello.

932
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
Zheng, welcome.

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,250
By the way.

934
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,840
Wang told me

935
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,320
that you knew
the esophageal tuberculosis patient

936
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
didn't have terminal cancer

937
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,280
when you first saw her.

938
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,440
Can you tell us

939
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,590
why you had this intuition at that time?

940
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,070
In the early stages
of esophageal cancer,

941
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,550
the patient will have a choking sensation
when eating.

942
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
It's not hard to detect.

943
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,960
And then?

944
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,280
Esophageal cancer

945
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,800
rarely spreads to the bones.

946
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,640
And even if it does,

947
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,070
it's unlikely to reach the ribs.

948
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,480
When Dr. Wang

949
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,230
looked at the PET,

950
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,000
I saw it too.

951
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,710
There were multiple abnormalities
on the ribs,

952
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,760
so I was inclined to judge this
as tuberculosis.

953
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,280
At a glance.

954
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,840
Wang.

955
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,510
You must learn from him.

956
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,110
Yes.

957
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,550
Not a glance.

958
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,510
15 seconds.

959
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,280
Mr. Li, let's sit down.

960
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,510
Let's sit down.

961
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,510
Let's sit down.

962
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,440
Don't worry, sir.

963
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,220
I practiced twice this morning.

964
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,110
OK.

965
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,270
Then it's up to you.

966
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,280
- Director Kong.
- OK.

967
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,030
Welcome, everyone.

968
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,680
Hello, Director Kong.

969
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,420
Thank you.

970
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,510
Everyone is here.

971
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,400
Please sit down.

972
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,030
Yun.

973
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,670
Zheng. We meet again.

974
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,400
I've heard a lot

975
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
about Zheng's glorious deeds.

976
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,630
You're a gem in the ocean.

977
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
It's a shame you're
at Haicheng Hospital.

978
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,360
You're quite an inquirer.

979
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,510
I need to know my enemy and myself.

980
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,710
We're all sitting here.

981
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,400
We're both peers and rivals.

982
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,840
Who doesn't want to win?

983
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,230
Keep talking to me.

984
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,630
Director Kong is staring at you.

985
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,480
Excuse me.

986
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,920
His teacher is Kong Yumin.

987
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,550
He's Beida's No. 1 demon.

988
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,630
Director Kong asked us to come here,

989
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,150
but we don't know what he is thinking.

990
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,400
We both need to be careful.

991
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,480
OK.

992
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,280
Hello, everyone.

993
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,190
Welcome to Beida.

994
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,320
Let me introduce myself.

995
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm the secretary of this program,

996
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,150
Jin Yaowu.

997
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm mainly responsible
for running errands.

998
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,590
From take-out orders

999
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,840
to meeting minutes,

1000
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,710
if you need anything, you can call me.

1001
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm at everyone's service

1002
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,590
24 hours a day.

1003
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,360
Hypocritical.

1004
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,110
Back to the topic.

1005
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,670
In recent years,

1006
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,930
foreign research groups

1007
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,340
have discovered
that prostate enlargement

1008
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,880
can be improved through intervention.

1009
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,920
Beida Hospital

1010
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,070
is following up on this research.

1011
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,960
Next,

1012
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm going to share with you

1013
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,550
the results of your professors'
recent research and development.

1014
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,710
It's well known

1015
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,780
that among men over 50...

1016
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,010
Watch this.

1017
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,470
The men sitting here now

1018
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,880
are the biggest names in the field

1019
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,190
and their personal disciples.

1020
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,840
They'll all be big players
in the field of intervention.

1021
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,600
It seriously affects

1022
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,480
the patient's quality of life.

1023
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,190
That's not necessarily true.

1024
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,550
Are you thinking

1025
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,760
that in the future,
you'll beat them in seconds?

1026
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,150
I'm not.

1027
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,840
Be honest, OK?

1028
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,920
That's what I think.

1029
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,220
[Big boss: the stuff is ready.
It'll be delivered in a few days.]

1030
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,700
[OK]

1031
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,190
Let's take a look at the anatomy.

1032
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,510
I'm sure you all know more

1033
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,360
about anatomy than I do.

1034
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,320
I'll teach fish to swim.

1035
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,540
At this point,

1036
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,320
the biggest difficulty with this surgery

1037
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,400
[Treatment]
is that the oxygen vessels

1038
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,360
in the prostate are very thin.

1039
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,880
It's hard for a normal guidewire
to get in.

1040
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,030
If the guidewire
doesn't enter completely,

1041
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,000
the treatment effect

1042
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,280
will not be good enough.

1043
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Frankly speaking,

1044
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,000
this surgery is very difficult.

1045
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,000
Generally,

1046
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,190
the results of the surgery
are not very good.

1047
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,400
OK.

1048
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,360
That's enough

1049
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,590
about the research.

1050
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,360
Currently,

1051
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,510
the patient who is to undergo
this experimental surgery

1052
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,800
is hospitalized at Urology.

1053
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,410
Due to the patient's advanced age

1054
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,840
and complications,

1055
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,280
the surgery will be difficult.

1056
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,110
I have sent the patient's medical record

1057
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,280
to your e-mail address

1058
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,400
so that you can review it.

1059
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,890
Please don't share it

1060
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,190
to protect the patient's privacy.

1061
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,380
[Age: 78]

1062
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,940
[Name: Bai Li]

1063
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,320
Old

1064
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,810
and having all kinds
of serious geriatric diseases.

1065
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,000
Even a Urology doctor

1066
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,020
removing the prostate

1067
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,800
has to risk the patient's sudden death.

1068
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,280
That's why they use intervention.

1069
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,710
There's only one patient.

1070
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,120
There's not enough to go around.

1071
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,490
So,

1072
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,070
if you want prostate surgery,

1073
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
you have to come out

1074
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,630
on top among liver cancer surgeries.

1075
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,910
It's time for everyone

1076
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,650
to show their skills.

1077
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,590
Do you want to see the patients?

1078
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,030
Okay, that's all

1079
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,920
for today's seminar.

1080
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,840
Thank you, everyone.

1081
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,960
For the next two days,

1082
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,110
you can take a good rest.

1083
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,960
Next Monday,

1084
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,110
we'll start

1085
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,000
the demonstration surgery.

1086
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,960
Thank you, everyone.

1087
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,070
Jin.

1088
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,710
Yun.

1089
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,510
What's going on?

1090
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm going to check the room

1091
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,590
and see the patients
for the demonstration surgery.

1092
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,070
Apply for me.

1093
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,440
Thank you

1094
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,510
for running errands.

1095
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,000
OK.

1096
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,000
Just a minute.

1097
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,710
Let's go.

1098
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,540
[Outpatient]

1099
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,070
What are you doing?

1100
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,630
Please.

1101
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,760
Don't take everything back,

1102
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,960
okay?

1103
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,280
This is a hospital room.

1104
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,920
They almost disinfect it
three times a day.

1105
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,510
And you throw garbage under the bed.

1106
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,230
This is all disinfected.

1107
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,070
But it's still garbage.

1108
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,760
Do you understand?

1109
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,550
I'm sorry.

1110
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,110
I'll take it right away.

1111
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,230
Take it out now.

1112
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,710
Good timing. Look at this.

1113
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,800
What's he doing?

1114
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,960
Get him out of here.

1115
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,360
You are

1116
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,230
Bai Li?

1117
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,110
Yes.

1118
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,670
I understand your situation.

1119
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,920
Get ready.

1120
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,030
Monday morning at 8:00 AM.

1121
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,550
Late liver intervention embolization.

1122
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,630
So soon?

1123
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,630
I didn't realize.

1124
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,920
What's your name?

1125
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,510
Zheng Ren.

1126
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,400
Wait.

1127
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,800
You're Zheng Ren?

1128
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,320
Didn't Su Li tell you?

1129
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,670
You should operate on me first.

1130
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,920
Do you understand?

1131
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,590
You are...?

1132
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,280
Qin Liren.

1133
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,400
One of the shareholders
of Haicheng Hospital.

1134
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,400
I understand your situation.

1135
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,760
You're in no hurry.

1136
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,440
Monday afternoon.

1137
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,230
Why no hurry?

1138
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,440
It's killing me.

1139
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,320
No.

1140
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,710
You have to treat me first.

1141
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,440
Otherwise,

1142
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,670
I'll change doctors.

1143
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,440
Be it.

1144
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,400
Anyone can do your surgery anyway.

1145
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,400
Get some rest.

1146
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,230
No food or water before the surgery.

1147
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay.

1148
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,150
- Zheng Ren.
- Rest well.

1149
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,510
Zheng Ren, come here.

1150
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,870
It's so annoying.

1151
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,070
What's wrong with Zheng Ren?

1152
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:19,920
Su Li.

1153
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,080
It's me.

1154
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,230
How do you run your hospital?

1155
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,840
And Zheng Ren.

1156
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,110
What's wrong with him?

1157
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,150
Why is that?

1158
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,420
Listen to me.

1159
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,080
I didn't like him at first,

1160
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,110
but now, I only want him
to operate on me.

1161
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,550
Tell him that.

1162
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,150
I don't mind if Beida's doctors

1163
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,480
treat me like this,

1164
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,400
but I can't stand it

1165
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,230
when Zheng Ren

1166
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,110
treats me like that.

1167
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,480
Does he want to go back
to Haicheng Hospital or not?

1168
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,760
Listen.

1169
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,840
This is my request.

1170
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,030
I have to be the first
to be operated on.

1171
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,670
Otherwise,

1172
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,000
I'll withdraw
from your hospital immediately.

1173
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,920
